        "Initial Access": "BADBOX is a global network of consumer products with firmware backdoors installed and sold through a normal hardware supply chain. These backdoored devices connect to a command-and-control (C2) server for instructions from the threat actors behind the scheme upon being activated by unsuspecting owners.",
        "Execution": "The backdoor is used to inject additional modules into device memory, enabling the threat actors to extend their capabilities, perpetuate several types of fraud, including multiple varieties of ad fraud, the establishment of residential proxy exit nodes, creation of fake Gmail and WhatsApp accounts, and remote un-permissioned code installation.",
        "Persistence": "The Triada malware, first uncovered in 2016, modifies a core process of the Android OS, effectively installing itself in every app on the device, including some system functionality, like text messaging. The root access Triada gains makes it remarkably powerful as a tool for cybercriminals.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The backdoor's connection to C2 servers on BADBOX-infected smartphones, tablets, and CTV boxes allows new apps or code to be remotely installed by the threat actors without the device owner's permission. The threat actors behind BADBOX could develop entirely new schemes and deploy them on BADBOX-infected devices without any interaction from the devices' owners.",
        "Credential Access": "Threat actors can use the backdoored devices to create WhatsApp messaging accounts by stealing one-time passwords from the devices. Additionally, threat actors can use the devices to create Gmail accounts, evading typical bot detection because the account looks like it was created from a normal tablet or smartphone, by a real person.",
        "Command and Control": "Infected devices, once turned on, immediately connect to one of several C2 servers. The backdoor is used to inject additional modules into device memory, enabling the threat actors to extend their capabilities, perpetuate several types of fraud, and periodically update the malware on the device to ensure each device remains part of the botnet.",
        "Others": "BADBOX-infected devices are unsalvageable by an average user since the malware is located on a read-only (ROM) partition of the device firmware. Products known to contain the backdoor have been found on public school networks throughout the United States. HUMAN customers have been protected from PEACHPIT, the ad fraud component of the BADBOX operation, for many months. Satori has shared information about the threat actors with law enforcement. The residential proxy module of BADBOX transforms each device into an endpoint for a global residential proxy network, allowing the threat actors behind BADBOX to sell access to your home network, which may result in cybercriminal activity being traced to your door."
