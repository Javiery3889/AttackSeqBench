        "Initial Access": "The Gholee malware campaign utilized a spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file named 'Operation Protective Edge.xlsb' (MD5: d0c3f4c9896d41a7c42737134ffb4c2e) to gain initial access to the victim's computer. The file, first uploaded to Virus Total on August 10, 2014, from Israel, was not initially detected as malicious by any antivirus engines. On August 19, 2014, it was detected by Kaspersky as Trojan-Dropper.MSExcel.Agent.ce.",
        "Execution": "Upon enabling Macro content in the malicious Excel file, the victim is presented with a message that disappears to show different content. The Macro code uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection and concatenates them into a single variable within a function. These functions are then combined to create a single PE file, which is saved as NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll (MD5: 48573a150562c57742230583456b4c02) and executed using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32 to hide the process.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Gholee malware employs obfuscation and includes mechanisms to hide from debuggers such as Ollydbg and IDA, as well as from sandbox software like Cuckoo and Anubis. The malware's entry point is named 'gholee', which is also the name of a popular Iranian singer, potentially indicating the origin of the threat actor.",
        "Command and Control": "The Gholee malware establishes command and control by communicating with a Kuwait-based IP address (83.170.33.60) owned by German company iABG Mbh. It opens an SSL connection over port 443 using an expired digital certificate issued to Core Security for *coreimpactagent.net by Thawte certificate authority. The certificate fingerprint is MD5: 9C 80 C2 47 40 6D 6C ED FC E0 08 AEEF D9 98 90. The malware's HTTP communication pattern includes GET and POST requests to /index.php with specific parameters.",
        "Others": "Related incidents reveal another file 'svchost 67.exe' (MD5: 916be1b609ed3dc80e5039a1d8102e82) uploaded to Virus Total on June 2, 2014, from Latvia, which communicated with an IP address (83.170.33.37) in the same netblock as the Gholee malware. Detection and prevention measures include disabling macro code via GPO, blocking files containing macro code at the email gateway, and monitoring logs and proxy servers for communication with the malware-associated IP addresses. A Yara rule is provided for detecting the Gholee malware."
