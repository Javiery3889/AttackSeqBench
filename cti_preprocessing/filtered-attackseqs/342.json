        "Initial Access": "Smooth Operator malware, targeting macOS, was distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software. The infected software package was signed by 3CX and notarized by Apple. Malicious code was inserted into a dynamic library (dylib) within the 3CX software, which then downloads and executes a second-stage payload.",
        "Execution": "Smooth Operator malware executes as part of the 3CX software. It creates a new thread to run its functionality and uses a constructor function within the dylib to initiate without affecting the normal usage of the library.",
        "Persistence": "Smooth Operator persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package, ensuring it runs every time the libffmpeg.dylib is loaded.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Smooth Operator employs several defense evasion techniques. The second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, daemonizes and detaches from the 3CX process. It also deletes itself from disk immediately after execution. The malware writes configuration files and executable stages to the legitimate 3CX installation directory to appear legitimate. Traffic to the C2 server is obfuscated with a custom data encoding algorithm.",
        "Discovery": "Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine, including the OS version from the SystemVersion.plist file and domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json. This data is included in beacons or exfiltration.",
        "Collection": "Smooth Operator stages collect data from the victim machine to be included in a beacon or exfiltration. It extracts the OS version, hostname, beacon interval, and C2 index, which are included in every beacon. The second-stage payload UpdateAgent parses and extracts domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json for exfiltration.",
        "Command and Control": "Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. It contains multiple C2 servers and randomly chooses a new server for each beacon. If one fails, it will try another.",
        "Exfiltration": "Smooth Operator automatically exfiltrates collected data, not over the existing C2 channel. The second-stage payload exfiltrates victim-specific data from a 3CX installation file and the victim ID generated by the first-stage via a HTTP GET request over HTTPS.",
        "Others": "Smooth Operator targets macOS and infects victims when they install specific trojanised versions of the 3CX software. It implements a file lock to ensure only one instance is running and generates a unique victim ID. The malware sleeps for 7 to 20 days before beaconing and uses a time-seeded random algorithm to generate beacon intervals. It has an embedded list of 15 C2s and one URL for the 3CX website, all obfuscated. The malware maintains a beacon error count and has taskable functionality supported by command IDs. The second-stage payload is lightweight and likely meant to determine which victims to pursue with further stages."
