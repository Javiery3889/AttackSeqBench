        "Initial Access": "Earlier this year, an uptick in attacks against Uyghur and Tibetan supporters was observed, utilizing an updated version of the NetTraveler backdoor. A targeted spear-phishing email directed at Uyghur activists in March 2014 contained two attachments: a non-malicious JPG file and a malicious Microsoft Word .DOC file named \"Sabiq sot xadimi gulnar abletning qeyin-Qistaqta olgenlikiashkarilanmaqta.doc\" with an MD5 hash of b2385963d3afece16bd7478b4cf290ce and a size of 381,667 bytes. The .DOC file exploited the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability, detected as Exploit.MSWord.CVE-2012-0158.db, to drop the main module \"net.exe\", which installs other files including the main C&C module into \"%SystemRoot%\\system32\\Windowsupdataney.dll\".",
        "Persistence": "The malware installs a main C&C module, \"WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL\" with an MD5 hash of c13c79ad874215cfec8d318468e3d116 and a size of 37,888 bytes, by registering it as a service named \"Windowsupdata\" through a Windows Batch file \"DOT.BAT\", detected as Trojan.BAT.Tiny.b. The malware ensures it isn't running multiple times by using mutexes such as \"SD_2013 Is Running!\" and others like \"Boat-12 Is Running!\", \"DocHunter2012 Is Running!\", and \"NetTravler Is Running!\".",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware uses a simple encryption scheme to hide its configuration, which is stored in the \"SYSTEM\" folder. The encryption can be decrypted with the algorithm provided, revealing the C&C server \"uyghurinfo[.]com\" among others.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware communicates with C&C servers such as \"ssdcru[.]com\", \"uygurinfo[.]com\", \"samedone[.]com\", \"gobackto[.]net\", \"worksware[.]net\", \"jojomic[.]com\", \"angellost[.]net\", and \"husden[.]com\". The IP locations and registrars for these domains are provided, with recommendations to block these hosts in firewalls.",
        "Others": "The NetTraveler APT, active for 10 years, targets various sectors with a focus on diplomatic, government, and military targets. Recent interests include space exploration, nano-technology, energy production, nuclear power, lasers, medicine, and communications. The targeting of Uyghur and Tibetan activists is a consistent aspect of their activities."
