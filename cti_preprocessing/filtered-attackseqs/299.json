        "Initial Access": "The Etumbot malware, associated with the Chinese threat actor group known as 'Numbered Panda', APT12, DYNCALC/CALC Team, and IXESHE, has been delivered to targets via spear phishing emails. These emails contain archives in .7z or .rar formats with filenames likely to interest the victim. One identified sample used a password-protected .7z file to deliver the Etumbot installer, with the password presumably provided in the email. The installer, often a .scr binary disguised as a Word Document using the right-to-left override (RTLO) trick, drops a decoy document and the backdoor, named sysupdate.exe in one instance.",
        "Persistence": "The Etumbot backdoor achieves persistence by creating a registry file within a temporary log file, which is then used to modify the registry to run the backdoor component at startup. The registry entry points to the backdoor binary located in the JAVA directory within the Application Data folder of the user's profile.",
        "Command and Control": "The Etumbot backdoor communicates with Command & Control (C&C) servers using HTTP requests. An initial beacon is sent to request an RC4 encryption key, which is then used to encrypt subsequent communications. The User-Agent and other headers in the HTTP request are hard-coded and can be used as indicators of compromise. The bot sends periodic pings to the C&C to ask for new commands to execute."
