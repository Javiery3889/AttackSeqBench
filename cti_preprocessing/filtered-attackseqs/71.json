The attackers may have used a third-party service to understand why they had suddenly lost almost all of their traffic. Victim C2 traffic analysis identified 456 malware agents installed on 326 victim systems in 35 countries. The majority of targets were using the latest version (7.8) of the Infy 'M' variant, suggesting that these higher-value targets are kept up-to-date. The attackers began to add server IP addresses as well as domain names to their malware C2 list after the takedown.",

The malware uses a different algorithm than that used for encrypting the malware strings to encrypt the exfiltration data, including keylogger data, malware logs, and information about the victim computer. The encrypted data is then base64 encoded."
