        "Initial Access": "The FHAPPI campaign involved an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website. The email's contents are undisclosed due to the sensitive nature of an APT attack. The malware, hosted under the account 'vbiayay1', was a VBScript encoded script. This script, when executed, would download a .doc file and open it, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.",
        "Execution": "The VBScript created an object in the shell and executed a PowerShell command to run base64 encoded code. This code led to the download and execution of a .ps1 file from another URL. The .ps1 file contained more base64 encoded code, which, when decoded, revealed the infection code for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The malware masqueraded as a 'Security Update' process and used PowerShell to execute the base64 code.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The FHAPPI campaign utilized multiple encodings and wraps to avoid detection, including multilayered base64 encoding. The attack was fileless, avoiding known signatures, and did not originate from the attacker's territory, improving the chances of a successful APT campaign.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware communicated with a C2 server located at the IP address 61.97.243.15, a dial-up IP in South Korea. The domain used for C2 communication was 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to an individual in China. The WHOIS information for the domain included contact details for 'Liu Ying'.",
        "Others": "The FHAPPI campaign was first recognized in Japan and named 'Free Hosting (pivoted) APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy' (FHAPPI). The campaign utilized Geocities Japan for hosting malware and targeted victims with a modified PowerSploit PoC code. The main payload was Poison Ivy, injected into the 'userinit.exe' process. The campaign also targeted Mongolian users with documents in Mongolian. The malware actions included extracting victim information, calling back to a C2 server, and other nefarious activities. The campaign was linked to a larger APT campaign and utilized email addresses 'wisers.data@gmail.com' and 'health.pro.demo30@gmail.com' for phishing. The CNC IP address and the email sender addresses are recommended to be blocked and traced. The malware files associated with the campaign have been deleted with the help of Yahoo Incident Response Division (YIRD), JP-CERT/CC, and other security professionals in Japan."
