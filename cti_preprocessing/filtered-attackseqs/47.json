        "Reconnaissance": "The BLACKGEAR espionage campaign, authored by Trend Micro researchers Joey Chen and MingYen Hsieh, has been known to use blogs and microblogging services to conceal the location of its command-and-control (C&C) servers, a technique that falls under the Reconnaissance tactic. This method allows the threat actor to quickly change the C&C servers by updating the information in these posts.",
        "Initial Access": "The BLACKGEAR campaign has evolved to target Japanese users, indicated by the use of fake documents in Japanese as part of its infection routines. This suggests the campaign's Initial Access tactic now includes crafting documents in the target's native language to increase the chances of successful infiltration.",
        "Persistence": "The malware tools used by BLACKGEAR, such as binders, downloaders, and backdoors, employ persistent methods to ensure their continued presence on infected machines. This includes moving to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder to maintain Persistence.",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoors used by BLACKGEAR, such as BKDR_ELIRKS and BKDR_YMALR, retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs, which is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic. They connect to these C&C servers and wait for commands from the threat actor.",
        "Others": "The BLACKGEAR campaign uses a variety of tools that are categorized into binders, downloaders, and backdoors. These tools are designed to be adaptable and replaceable, allowing the threat actors to quickly respond to detection and blocking efforts. The campaign has shown connections between different tools, such as shared strings and decryption keys, indicating a coordinated set of malware families. Trend Micro continues to monitor BLACKGEAR's activities to protect customers."
