        "Initial Access": "North Korean state-sponsored hackers, associated with the APT Lazarus/HIDDEN COBRA group, have been implicated in breaking into online stores of large US retailers and planting payment skimmers as early as May 2019. The method of access is currently unknown, but attackers often use spearphishing attacks to obtain retail staff passwords.",
        "Command and Control": "HIDDEN COBRA injects malicious scripts into the store checkout pages to intercept transactions. The skimmer waits for customer keystrokes and, upon transaction completion, sends the intercepted data, such as credit card numbers, to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.",
        "Exfiltration": "HIDDEN COBRA developed a global exfiltration network that utilizes legitimate sites hijacked and repurposed to disguise criminal activity. The network funnels stolen assets to be sold on dark web markets. Identified exfiltration nodes include an Italian modeling agency, a vintage music store from Tehran, and a family-run bookstore from New Jersey.",
        "Others": "Sansec's research has linked the skimming activity to HIDDEN COBRA due to reused infrastructure from previous operations and distinctive patterns in the malware code. Sansec monitors millions of online stores for skimming activity and typically finds 30 to 100 infected stores per day. The skimming operations have been ongoing since at least May 2019, with multiple independent links to previously documented North Korean hacking operations."
