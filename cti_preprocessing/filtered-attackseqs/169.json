        "Resource Development": "The threat actors acquired domain names from multiple registrars, including Njalla, and rented servers from various hosting companies, predominantly ServerAstra in 2020. They compromised over twenty high-profile websites to inject JavaScript code that would load additional malicious code from their command and control (C&C) servers.",
        "Initial Access": "Visitors to the compromised websites were potentially exposed to exploits after their browsers were fingerprinted. Additionally, the threat actors engaged in spearphishing campaigns, sending emails with malicious Word documents containing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.",
        "Execution": "The malicious Word documents contained VBA macros that executed code using the Document_Open function.",
        "Command and Control": "The scripts from the watering hole attacks communicated with the C&C servers using HTTPS.",
        "Others": "The campaign targeted high-profile organizations in the Middle East, with a focus on Yemen. The attackers likely purchased Candiru implants and exploits. The campaign involved strategic web compromises, where the attackers modified legitimate websites to inject malicious scripts. The campaign went quiet after July 2021, possibly due to the threat actors retooling after publications by Citizen Lab, Google, and Microsoft detailed Candiru's activities. A comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples is available on GitHub."
