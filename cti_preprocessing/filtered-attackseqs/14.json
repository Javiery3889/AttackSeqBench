        "Initial Access": "A Russian-language phishing campaign was active during the second week of August 2017, targeting Russian banks with emails that appeared to be from disgruntled customers complaining about extra charges. The emails contained malicious attachments exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter, likely CVE-2017-0262, which had been patched in April 2017. The campaign involved at least 23 attachments with names such as 'Account statement', 'Card statement', and 'Personal information'. The attachments were nearly identical, with variations in checksums possibly intended to generate unique hashes. The exploit was delivered via docx files containing an embedded EPS image file, which included obfuscated code and a multibyte XOR key. The attackers signed their malware with lyrics from Slipknot's 'Snuff' and included obfuscated comments possibly targeting Kaspersky. The campaign was brought to the attention of the Central Bank of Russia's FinCERT by one or more targeted banks.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware communicated with a compromised server at IP address 137.74.224[.]142, which was previously associated with a Minecraft server. The server responded with HTTP 200 and the message 'False'. The communication occurred at five-second intervals, and the server's historic DNS resolutions were examined for potential associations with previous campaigns."
