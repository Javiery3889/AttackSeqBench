        "Reconnaissance": "The Geumseong121 APT hacking group carried out a mobile APT attack, distributing a malicious app (APK) via a website disguised as a fundraising service for North Korean defectors. The website, built on the WordPress platform, was created on August 23, 2019, and updated on October 22. The site featured snapshots from September 11 to October, indicating it supported North Korean defectors, and added an Android app installation link in October. The site used various promotion strategies to trick users into installing the app. The operation, named \"Dragon Messenger,\" involved the malicious application collecting data via the 'DragonTask' path and the attack being performed under the guise of a secure messenger.",
        "Initial Access": "The malicious app was distributed through a website that appeared to be a charity site supporting North Korean defectors. The app was registered on the official Google Play Store but has since been removed by Google. The app claimed to offer services for North Korean defectors to share life-related issues and specify donation services. The attackers also used YouTube and Facebook to promote the app and prepare the attack, with about 330 friends registered on Facebook, potentially exposing them to threats.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers made efforts to avoid suspicion by disguising the North Korean fundraising apps as unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps. However, the initial versions of these apps included functionality to communicate with Dropbox and Yandex, and variable declarations used by the malicious apps were almost identical to those found in previous malicious apps.",
        "Others": "The Geumseong121 APT hacking group targeted Android smartphone users with eavesdropping attacks, attempting to steal SMS, phone address books, eavesdrop on phone conversations, and leak KakaoTalk messages. The 'zombied' smartphones were monitored by attackers for extended periods, often without the victims' knowledge. ESRC is investigating the threat activities of this state-sponsored APT hacking group and has identified several Indicators of Compromise (IoC)."
