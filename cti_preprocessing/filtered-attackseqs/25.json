        "Initial Access": "CyberInt researchers have been tracking activities following a spear-phishing campaign targeting US-based retailers since December 2018. The campaign leveraged a legitimate remote administration tool, 'Remote Manipulator System' (RMS), developed by TektonIT, to gain entry into networks and evade security controls. The phishing emails contained malicious MS Office documents and used social engineering tactics.",
        "Execution": "The malicious MS Office documents delivered via phishing emails instructed victims to disable security controls to allow a nefarious macro to execute. This macro would then attempt to download malicious payloads from the threat actor's C2 infrastructure, which often masqueraded as legitimate-looking domains. The initial payload was typically a robust malware downloader used to gather further components, including the RMS tool, supporting shell scripts, and configuration files.",
        "Persistence": "For persistence, the second-stage shell script added a 'Microtik' string value to the 'HKEY_CURRENT_USERS' hive, 'Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run' key to launch the RMS executable whenever the user logged on. Additionally, the RMS executable was launched before the script tried to forcefully kill the 'rundll32.exe' process, causing the script to go into a loop.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The threat actors utilized the RMS tool's capabilities to conduct reconnaissance and lateral movement within a victim network. The use of legitimate remote administration tools allowed threat actors to directly perform malicious activities as well as leverage the tool's capabilities to avoid detection.",
        "Command and Control": "The RMS executable attempted to 'call home' with connection attempts observed to a C2 server located in Germany. Additional malicious samples and associated C2 domains/IP addresses were linked to TA505 operations utilizing the 'ServHelper' backdoor.",
        "Others": "The sophisticated threat actor group dubbed 'TA505' has been active since 2014, conducting high-volume malicious email campaigns, including the distribution of banking trojans, botnets, exploit kits, and ransomware. TA505's recent campaigns have included the use of RMS in attacks against US-based retailers and the financial industry. Indicators of compromise identified in the US retail campaign were consistent with an attack against the Notary Chamber of Ukraine, also during December 2018. The accessibility and simplicity of using RMS for nefarious purposes likely explain the prevalence of the tool in unrelated malicious campaigns."
