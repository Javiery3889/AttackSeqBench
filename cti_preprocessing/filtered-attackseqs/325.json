        "Initial Access": "Check Point Research identified a campaign targeting the Mongolian public sector using two RTF documents exploiting Microsoft Word vulnerabilities to deliver a new malware implant. The documents, weaponized with RoyalRoad tool version 7.x, were sent under the guise of information related to COVID-19, originating from the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Upon opening, the RTF files exploit the Equation Editor vulnerabilities, leading to the dropping of 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder, establishing persistence and requiring a relaunch of Word for full execution.",
        "Execution": "The 'intel.wll' file, once executed, downloads and decrypts the next stage of the infection chain from the server at 95.179.242[.]6. This stage is a DLL file acting as the main loader for the malware framework, which communicates with another C&C server at 95.179.242[.]27 to receive additional functionality. The threat actor's C&C server operates within a limited daily window, complicating the analysis of the advanced parts of the infection chain. The final stage involves downloading and decrypting a RAT module, also a DLL, which is loaded into memory. This modular architecture suggests the possibility of additional modules beyond the observed payload.",
        "Persistence": "The malware uses the Word startup folder to maintain persistence by dropping the 'intel.wll' file, which is executed every time Microsoft Word is launched.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers' C&C server at 95.179.242[.]6 was found to have directory listing enabled for a limited time, revealing the operation timeline and working hours of the attackers. All files on the server were encrypted, but decryption was possible using the same scheme observed in the infection chain. The attackers seem to enable directory listing when actively using a payload delivery server.",
        "Collection": "The RAT module downloaded during the final stage of the infection chain has capabilities to take screenshots, list files and directories, create and delete directories, move and delete files, download files, and execute new processes.",
        "Command and Control": "The main loader of the malware communicates with a C&C server at 95.179.242[.]27 to receive additional functionality. The RAT module communicates with the C&C server to receive commands and send collected data.",
        "Others": "The campaign, attributed to a Chinese-based threat actor, has been active since at least 2016, targeting various sectors in countries like Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. The infrastructure used includes Vultr servers and GoDaddy-registered domains. The malware's full intention remains unclear, but it is part of a long-running operation leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic to lure victims. Check Point SandBlast Agent can protect against this APT attack."
