        "Initial Access": "During routine analysis, Bitdefender researchers discovered that the initial access to infected systems was primarily through an installer named 20SPEED-VPN-v9.2.exe, which contained components of the SecondEye monitoring application. This installer was not recognized as a valid InnoSetup executable, indicating it was a different type of installer, possibly Smart Install Maker. The installer placed spyware components in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps directory and launched the first stage of the spyware, sysCrt32.exe, along with a legitimate InnoSetup installer for the VPN software located in the %TEMP% folder.",
        "Execution": "The execution flow begins with sysCrt32.exe, which ensures persistence and adds the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% environment variable. It then executes various batch files for initialization and sets up scheduled tasks to run sysBus32.exe every 3 hours. sysBus32.exe is responsible for downloading and executing the second stage from the C2 server. Other executables like libCache32.exe, libTemp32.exe, and libchrome.exe are also part of the execution process, performing keylogging, clipboard logging, and Chrome password extraction, respectively.",
        "Persistence": "The spyware establishes persistence by adding the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% environment variable and setting up scheduled tasks to run sysBus32.exe every 3 hours. sysCrt32.exe checks for the presence of the folder in the environment variables and the scheduled task, and if not found, calls scripts to add them.",
        "Credential Access": "The spyware components include libchrome.exe, which queries Google Chrome's SQLite databases to log usernames and passwords. It uses stolen tokens from Local State and Login Data files to decrypt the stored passwords.",
        "Collection": "The collection process involves sysOptimizer.bat, which collects and archives personal files from the infected system, including files from the Firefox directory and various file types from potential personal data folders. libCache32.exe and libTemp32.exe are also involved in the collection process, performing keylogging and clipboard content logging.",
        "Command and Control": "The C2 servers belong to SecondEye and are hosted on Novinhost. The IP used by the initial execution flow is 213.232.124.157, and the other IP used by the additional payloads is 94.130.247.148. The servers are not always running, and the malware uses curl.exe to access the FTP servers.",
        "Exfiltration": "The exfiltration process is handled by sysUp32.bat, which collects all files created by the components and uploads them to the FTP server. It also exfiltrates Chrome passwords and crypto-wallet data for various applications.",
        "Others": "The campaign distribution indicates a growing number of detections in the past 6 months, particularly in Iran, as individuals seek VPN access to the internet. Bitdefender protects against this threat by detecting the malicious installer and blocking the process that initializes the spyware. The malicious executables from the second stage are also detected, and existing infections are identified by detecting the persistence process. The article recommends using well-known VPN solutions from legitimate sources and a security solution like Bitdefender to protect against information stealers."
