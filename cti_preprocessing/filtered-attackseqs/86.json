        "Initial Access": "Recently, a new series of malware samples were submitted to major online sandboxes, with one sample submitted to Virus Total attributed to the Russian APT28 group. The attack analyzed is multi-stage, with an initial dropper malware written in Delphi programming language downloading a second stage payload from the internet and executing it. The payload communicates with the server using the HTTPS protocol.",
        "Execution": "The malware initiates contact with the command and control server, downloading the file 'upnphost.exe' to the path '%APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp', which is likely the final payload. The executable implements a persistence mechanism by setting a registry key.",
        "Persistence": "The executable 'upnphost.exe' implements a persistence mechanism by setting a registry key to maintain its foothold on the system.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The 'upnphost.exe' file was submitted to Virus Total, likely due to the evasion technique implemented by the dropper. To analyze the dropper, it was patched, revealing the complete malicious behavior of the malware.",
        "Discovery": "The malware sends information gathered on the operating system to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'. The server is located in Hong Kong according to WHOIS records.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware contacts the command and control server using HTTPS communication with a POST method. Another file, 'sdbn.dll', contacts the domain 'marina-info.net', which is a reference to the Italian Marina Militare. The domain resolves to the IP '191.101.31.250' located in Holland. The communication is managed with a script written in the AutoIt language, embedded in the 'upnphost.exe' file as a resource.",
        "Others": "The attack threat map indicates the attack surface covered by the hacker group is wide, with C2Cs in Europe and China. Yara rules are provided for the dropper, first payload 'upnphost.exe', and second payload 'sdbn.dll' associated with APT28 XAGENT July 2018."
