        "Initial Access": "In the early stages of the investigation, ESET researchers, with input from Citizen Lab, discovered a version of Hacking Team's Remote Control System (RCS) spyware being used in the wild, signed with a previously unseen valid digital certificate. At least in two cases, the spyware was detected in an executable file disguised as a PDF document, attached to a spearphishing email targeting diplomats.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The post-leak samples of Hacking Team's spyware were found to have forged Manifest metadata to masquerade as legitimate applications, appearing as 'Advanced SystemCare 9 (9.3.0.1121)', 'Toolwiz Care 3.1.0.0', and 'SlimDrivers (2.3.1.10)'. The authors used VMProtect to make the samples less prone to detection, a technique also common among pre-leak Hacking Team spyware. A difference in Startup file size was noted as a primitive detection evasion technique, changing from 4MB pre-leak to 6MB post-leak.",
        "Command and Control": "The analysis identified several C&C (Command and Control) servers associated with the post-leak Hacking Team spyware samples. The servers are located at IP addresses 149.154.153.223, 192.243.101.125, 180.235.133.23, 192.243.101.124, 95.110.167.74, 149.154.153.223, 188.166.244.225, 45.33.108.172, 178.79.186.40, 95.110.167.74, 173.236.149.166, 188.226.170.222, 173.236.149.166, 46.165.236.62, 199.175.54.209, 199.175.54.228, and 95.110.167.74.",
        "Others": "ESET's analysis of Hacking Team's post-leak spyware samples, compiled between September 2015 and October 2017, suggests active development by Hacking Team's developers. The samples were signed with six different certificates issued to Valeriano Bedeschi, Raffaele Carnacina, Megabit, OOO, ADD Audit, Media Lid, and Ziber Ltd. The versioning observed in the analyzed samples continues where Hacking Team left off before the breach, and follows the same patterns. The functionality of the spyware largely overlaps with that in the leaked source code, with no significant updates confirmed. ESET has detected these new Hacking Team spyware samples in fourteen countries."
