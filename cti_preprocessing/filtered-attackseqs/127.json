        "Initial Access": "The Threat Recon team from NSHC reported on March 28, 2019, that a threat actor group targeted organizations in South Korea, the US, and East Asia with malware distributed via spear phishing emails. The emails contained malicious documents that, when executed, would download a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in the document.",
        "Execution": "The malware infection method involved a multi-step process using batch files. Initially, a script in a malicious document would download a base64-encoded text file (1.txt), which is then decoded to create and execute a batch file (1.bat). This batch file would then download additional text files (2.txt for 32-bit or 3.txt for 64-bit systems), which are decoded to create a 'setup.cab' file. The CAB file contained a BAT file for executing the main payload, an INI file with the attacker server address, a DLL file for UAC bypass, and the main EXE payload.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "The malware used a specific User Access Control (UAC) bypass module to execute the main payload without triggering a UAC pop-up. This was achieved by copying the INI configuration file and the main payload EXE into the System32 folder, which would normally prompt a UAC pop-up for security reasons. The UAC bypass module was created by referencing the open-source UAC-TokenMagic.ps1 on GitHub and involved creating a wusa.exe process with a High Integrity Level, copying its token, and running cmd.exe with elevated privileges to execute the batch file installing the main payload.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The threat actor group utilized a UAC bypass module to prevent the User Account Control (UAC) pop-up from appearing when files were moved to the System32 folder, which is a typical defense mechanism in Windows operating systems. The UAC bypass allowed the malware to execute without alerting the user.",
        "Others": "The Threat Recon team identified the use of decoy documents in Russian, English, and Korean languages, and the deployment of malware variants BABYFACE and SYSCON as the main payload. The activities of the threat actor group may be related to previously known groups. Indicators of compromise include SHA-256 hashes and IP addresses associated with the attack."
