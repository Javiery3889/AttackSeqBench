The loader also maintains two methods for privilege and DEP process protection handling: GETSID_METHOD_1 and GETSID_METHOD_2. The binary contains two resources: BINARY 201 and BINARY 202, the latter being the actual payload and is not encrypted. The loader creates a mutex and waits up to two minutes if it is already present while logging the message \"IsLoaderAlreadyWork +\". It extracts the resource BINARY 201, which contains a wide string name of processes to inject into (i.e., \"explorer.exe\"). The loader makes a pipe named \\\\.\\"
