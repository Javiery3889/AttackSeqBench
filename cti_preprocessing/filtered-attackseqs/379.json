        "Initial Access": "Throughout 2016, Proofpoint researchers observed a cyber-espionage campaign by an actor believed to be operating out of China, targeting victims in Russia and neighboring countries. The actor employed spear-phishing campaigns to deliver the NetTraveler Trojan, also known as TravNet, which has been active since at least 2004. The spear-phishing campaigns involved links to RAR-compressed executables and Microsoft Word attachments exploiting the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability. The actor targeted organizations such as weapons manufacturers, human rights activists, and pro-democracy groups. The spear-phishing emails contained URLs linking to RAR files with executables and decoy documents, or Microsoft Word attachments using CVE-2012-0158 to install NetTraveler. The actor registered news and military lookalike sites for Command and Control (C&C) and payload hosting, selecting victim-relevant news topics for the phishing lures.",
        "Command and Control": "The actor set up Command and Control (C&C) and payload hosting domains using lookalike news and military sites. These domains were used to host the NetTraveler payloads and facilitate communication with compromised systems. The domains mimicked legitimate news agencies and military forums, and were registered with Shanghai Meicheng Technology Information Development Co., Ltd. in Beijing. The C&C domains included www.interfaxru[.]com, www.info-spb[.]com, www.tassnews[.]net, www.riaru[.]net, www.voennovosti[.]com, and www.mogoogle[.]com. The IP addresses 103.231.184[.]164, 103.231.184[.]163, and 98.126.38[.]107 were also used for NetTraveler C&C."
