        "Initial Access": "APT33 utilized spear phishing campaigns to target companies in the oil product supply chain, using the private website of a European politician to send emails to companies in the supply chain of oil products. Targets included a water facility used by the U.S. army for potable water supply at one of its military bases.",
        "Persistence": "APT33 used botnets comprising small groups of infected computers to maintain persistence within the networks of select targets. The malware used has limited capabilities, including downloading and running additional malware.",
        "Defense Evasion": "APT33 employed multiple layers of obfuscation for their C&C servers, using cloud-hosted proxies to relay requests from infected bots to backends at shared web servers hosting legitimate domains. The backends would then report bot data back to a data aggregator and bot control server with a dedicated IP address. APT33 actors accessed these aggregators via a private VPN network with frequently changed exit nodes.",
        "Discovery": "APT33 conducted reconnaissance on networks relevant to the oil industry's supply chain, including an oil exploration company, military hospitals in the Middle East, and an oil company in the U.S. They used private VPN exit nodes for this purpose.",
        "Command and Control": "APT33 operated about a dozen live C&C servers for extremely narrow targeting, using small botnets of about a dozen bots each. They used a private VPN network to issue commands to the bots and collect data.",
        "Others": "APT33 showed interest in websites related to penetration testing, vulnerabilities, cryptocurrencies, hacker blogs and forums, and recruitment in the oil and gas industry. Security recommendations include establishing a regular patching policy, improving employee awareness, applying the principle of least privilege, and installing multilayered protection systems. Indicators of compromise include several SHA256 hashes associated with the malware used by APT33."
