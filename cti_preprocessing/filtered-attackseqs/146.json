        "Reconnaissance": "The report does not provide explicit details on the Reconnaissance tactics used by the threat actors involved in the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise. However, it mentions that the attackers demonstrated an impressive degree of reconnaissance and focus, suggesting that they had intimate knowledge of SolarWinds' source code, network topology, and internal development domain names. This knowledge was used to minimize the risk of detection by vigilant employees.",
        "Resource Development": "The report indicates that the threat actors behind the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, referred to as UNC2452, demonstrated significant Resource Development capabilities. They were selective in their targeting, choosing specific organizations to pursue while excluding others. The report suggests adding the ATT&CK sub-technique T1583.001 Acquire Infrastructure: Domains to the UNC2452 actor profile, as the actors parked domains for future use. Additionally, the report notes that the attackers may have had access to private web servers and developed malware capabilities.",
        "Initial Access": "The report discusses the Initial Access tactic in the context of the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise. It highlights that the attackers used a supply chain compromise, specifically a compromised software update, as their initial access vector. This technique is listed as T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, with the sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain.",
        "Execution": "The report mentions that the threat actors used various Execution techniques, including T1072 Software Deployment Tools, to run malicious code as part of their operations. Additionally, the attackers used system services to execute code, as indicated by the technique T1569 System Services.",
        "Persistence": "The report does not provide specific details on Persistence techniques used by the threat actors. However, it implies that the attackers were able to maintain their foothold within the compromised networks by being selective in their targeting and careful to avoid detection.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "The report does not provide specific details on Privilege Escalation techniques used by the threat actors. However, it suggests that the attackers had a high level of system access, which may imply the use of techniques to gain elevated permissions.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The report details several Defense Evasion techniques used by the threat actors, including T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, T1036 Masquerading, T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, and T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion. The attackers took great care to avoid detection by security tools and personnel, demonstrating a high level of sophistication in evading defenses.",
        "Credential Access": "The report does not provide specific details on Credential Access techniques used by the threat actors. However, the use of valid accounts (T1078) is mentioned, suggesting that the attackers may have had access to legitimate credentials to facilitate their operations.",
        "Discovery": "The report mentions Discovery techniques such as T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry, which the threat actors used to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network of the compromised organizations.",
        "Lateral Movement": "The report does not provide specific details on Lateral Movement techniques used by the threat actors. However, it suggests that the attackers were able to move through the network to reach their objectives, which may involve the use of techniques to control remote systems.",
        "Collection": "The report does not provide specific details on Collection techniques used by the threat actors. However, it mentions that the attackers were focused on information theft and espionage, which implies the use of techniques to gather data relevant to their goals.",
        "Command and Control": "The report discusses Command and Control techniques, including T1071 Application Layer Protocol and T1568 Dynamic Resolution, which the threat actors used to communicate with the compromised systems and maintain control over them.",
        "Exfiltration": "The report does not provide specific details on Exfiltration techniques used by the threat actors. However, it mentions that the attackers were likely focused on stealing data, which suggests the use of techniques to remove data from the target network.",
        "Impact": "The report does not provide specific details on Impact techniques used by the threat actors. However, it suggests that the primary goal of the attackers was espionage rather than destruction, indicating that impact techniques may not have been a focus of this campaign.",
        "Others": "The report provides an analysis of the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, discussing the attribution challenges and the possibility of multiple actors being involved. It highlights the need for further investigation and intelligence analysis to understand the full scope of the campaign and the actors behind it. The report also emphasizes the importance of using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK for mapping adversary TTPs and improving defensive strategies."
