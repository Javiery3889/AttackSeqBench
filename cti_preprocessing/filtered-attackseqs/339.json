        "Initial Access": "The CTI report from seguranca-informatica.pt, authored by Pedro Tavares, details a phishing campaign targeting Portuguese users with emails mimicking the Portuguese Government Finance & Tax. The emails, which discuss issues related to a debt from 2018, contain links that download a zip file named 'FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.zip' from an online server. This file, once extracted, reveals three files, one of which is a VBScript file acting as a dropper and downloader for the Lampion trojan.",
        "Execution": "The Lampion trojan's execution begins when the victim clicks on a link in the phishing email, which downloads a zip file containing a VBScript file. This file, once executed, downloads two additional files: 'P-19-2.dll' and '0.zip'. The 'P-19-2.dll' file is executed at system startup and invokes the second file, '0.zip', which contains a DLL with additional code for the trojan's operation.",
        "Persistence": "The Lampion trojan achieves persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows StartUp folder, which triggers the execution of the trojan every time the victim's computer starts. Additionally, a new VBS file is created to execute the trojan upon system startup.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Lampion trojan employs anti-debug and anti-VM techniques to evade analysis. It uses VMProtect 3.x to protect its code, making manual analysis and sandbox detection difficult. The trojan also includes a large amount of junk data within its files to hinder detection by antivirus engines.",
        "Command and Control": "The Lampion trojan communicates with a C2 server to send collected data, including details from the computer's disk, opened windows, clipboard, and banking credentials. The C2 server is not detected as malicious by antivirus agents at the time of the report.",
        "Others": "The CTI report includes indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, hashes, and Yara rules for detecting the Lampion trojan. The report also mentions efforts to decommission the domains and C2 server associated with the trojan by contacting Amazon Web Services (AWS). Despite these efforts, malicious endpoints were still active at the time of the report's writing."
