        "Initial Access": "The OceanLotus APT group targeted a Vietnamese environmentalist using a bait document within a zip archive named in Vietnamese, which contained pictures illustrating environmental issues and an hta script attack sample. The hta script was designed to decrypt and load additional data, utilizing DLL Side-Loading to exploit Adobe Reader and establish a connection to the C2 server.",
        "Execution": "The execution process involved an obfuscated hta script that replaced certain characters with '+', '/', '='. The script used the cactusTorch framework to decrypt the Loader module, which then decrypted attached data and executed the decrypted shellcode in memory.",
        "Persistence": "The shellcode executed by the Loader was responsible for releasing a file and achieving persistence. It used the RtlDecompressBuffer to extract a PE file from resource data and created an empty docx file under the temp folder to mislead the victim into thinking it was a legitimate document.",
        "Defense Evasion": "OceanLotus employed DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion, using legitimate Adobe 3D Utility files and hijacked dlls to load the next stage payload. The attack also involved inserting encrypted data at the end of the hta script, randomly naming released files, and filling the exe entry point with junk code to avoid stack traceback.",
        "Command and Control": "The Denis family variant shellcode, once loaded, established C2 communication with udt.sophiahoule.com, allowing the adversary to control the compromised computer.",
        "Others": "The OceanLotus APT group, first exposed by SkyEye Labs in May 2015, has been active since April 2012, targeting various organizations. The RedDrip Team of QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center monitors OceanLotus activities and provides in-depth analysis. QiAnXin products are currently capable of protecting users from new attacks by OceanLotus."
