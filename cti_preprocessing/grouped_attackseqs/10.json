        "Initial Access": "Unit 42 observed a new variant of Poison Ivy, named SPIVY, being deployed via weaponized documents leveraging CVE-2015-2545. The documents were themed around recent Hong Kong pro-democracy events. The exploit drops a self-extracting RAR containing three files: a legitimate executable (RasTls.exe) for side-loading the malware DLL (ssMUIDLL.dll), and an encoded shellcode Poison Ivy backdoor (samsung.hlp).",
        "Execution": "The SPIVY variant of Poison Ivy uses a search order hijacking technique, also known as 'DLL Sideloading', similar to malware like PlugX. The Poison Ivy builder allows output as either a PE file or shellcode. In this case, the backdoor was built as shellcode and then obfuscated to prevent detection. The encoded shellcode is decoded with a single byte addition of 0x99, XOR with 0xD4, then subtract 0x33. The decoded shellcode is launched by ssMUIDLL.dll.",
        "Defense Evasion": "SPIVY uses a modified network communication protocol to help evade detection. Unlike previous versions of Poison Ivy which utilize a fixed 256 byte challenge-response handshake, SPIVY generates a payload with 1 to 16 bytes of pseudo-random data plus control bytes, where the 1st byte indicates the length of the padding before the handshake. The remainder of the protocol remains unchanged.",
        "Command and Control": "Two C2 domains were identified: sent.leeh0m[.]org and found.leeh0m[.]org, both third-level domains off of leeh0m[.]org, created in late February 2016. Unit 42 observed two configurations with SHA256 hashes 9c6dc1c2ea5b2370b58b0ac11fde8287cd49aee3e089dbdf589cc8d51c1f7a9e and 4d38d4ee5b625e09b61a253a52eb29fcf9c506ee9329b3a90a0b3911e59174f2, both using password 'bqesid#@', C2 port 443, and mutex '40EM76iR9'.",
        "Others": "The decoy documents associated with SPIVY reference specific events and organizations related to the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. One decoy is from Joshua Wong, announcing a press conference about ending the Scholarism group to start a political party, Demosist\u014d. Another concerns the Mong Kok riot, purporting to be from the Justice & Peace Commission of the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese. The final decoy is an invitation to a wreath laying event by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre."
