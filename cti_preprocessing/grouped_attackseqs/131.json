Cloud Shell used for reverse SSH tunneling after initial compromise vector. Domain previously identified by TAG used in ongoing attacks against researchers. Threat actors abuse Cloud Shell to initiate reverse SSH tunnels from compromised environments to avoid detection. A North Korean sponsored actor appears to have re-used a domain identified by TAG in an intrusion campaign involving manipulated IDA Pro.",

        "Others": "Vulnerable instances of Apache Log4j still sought by attackers. Despite patching, attackers are continuing to scan public-facing sites for those that have not been properly patched. Google Cloud was proactive in assuring the security of the platform and we partnered extensively with customers to provide tooling and support to help them mitigate and remediate Log4j risks. This included threat intelligence-driven updates to Cloud Armor, Cloud IDS, Security Command Center, and Event/Container Threat Detection and we were pleased to see many customers proactively respond to this event and use these capabilities to defend themselves and their customers. Google Cloud customers also used a variety of scanners and fuzzers to help identify the presence of Log4j in Cloud instances and their dependencies."
