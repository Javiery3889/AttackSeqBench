        "Execution": "The attackers developed a new version (31) of the Infy malware and deployed it against a single Canadian target. The file descriptions remained the same, and there was no change to the encoding key used for the entire decade-long campaign.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers developed a new version (31) of the Infy malware and deployed it against a single Canadian target. The file descriptions remained the same, and there was no change to the encoding key used for the entire decade-long campaign.",
        "Command and Control": "Unit 42 researchers gained control of multiple C2 domains, disabling the attacker's access to their victims and providing further insight into the targets. The attackers may have used a third-party service to understand why they had suddenly lost almost all of their traffic. Victim C2 traffic analysis identified 456 malware agents installed on 326 victim systems in 35 countries. The majority of targets were using the latest version (7.8) of the Infy 'M' variant, suggesting that these higher-value targets are kept up-to-date. The attackers began to add server IP addresses as well as domain names to their malware C2 list after the takedown.",
        "Exfiltration": "The attackers registered multiple domains using a previously-seen pattern against known campaign IP addresses for data exfiltration. The malware uses a different algorithm than that used for encrypting the malware strings to encrypt the exfiltration data, including keylogger data, malware logs, and information about the victim computer. The encrypted data is then base64 encoded."
