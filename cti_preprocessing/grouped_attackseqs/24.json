    "rewrite": {
        "Initial Access": "The LYCEUM threat group gained initial access to organizations by using account credentials obtained through password spraying or brute-force attacks. They then sent spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments to deliver the DanBot malware.",
        "Execution": "LYCEUM executed the DanBot malware, a first-stage remote access trojan (RAT) that uses DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms. The malware provides basic remote access capabilities, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands via cmd.exe and to upload and download files. Additionally, the group used a PowerShell-based keylogger (kl.ps1), a script to decrypt passwords from the RDCMan configuration file (Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1), and a script to gather account information from Active Directory (Get-LAPSP.ps1).",
        "Defense Evasion": "LYCEUM utilized DanDrop, a VBA macro embedded in an Excel XLS file, to drop the DanBot malware. They made incremental improvements to obfuscate the macro and refactor some of the functionality to evade defenses.",
        "Credential Access": "LYCEUM deployed tools such as Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 to decrypt passwords stored in the RDCMan configuration file and Get-LAPSP.ps1 to gather account information from Active Directory, which could provide additional access within the environment.",
        "Discovery": "LYCEUM targeted HR and IT personnel with spearphishing emails to compromise accounts that could yield information and access for further spearphishing operations within the targeted environment and against associated organizations.",
        "Command and Control": "LYCEUM registered new domains for individual campaigns, which were typically used within a few weeks of registration. These domains, suspected to be part of LYCEUM's command and control infrastructure, often had a security or web technology theme.",
        "Others": "The LYCEUM threat group has been active since at least April 2018, targeting critical infrastructure organizations in the Middle East, particularly in the oil and gas sector. They have demonstrated capabilities similar to other threat groups operating in the region, such as COBALT GYPSY and COBALT TRINITY. Secureworks Counter Threat Unit researchers recommend implementing multi-factor authentication, increasing visibility via endpoint detection, response, and logging, conducting preparedness exercises, and reinforcing phishing awareness to mitigate the threat posed by LYCEUM."
