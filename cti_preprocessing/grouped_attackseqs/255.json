        "Reconnaissance": "The Inception attackers have been active since at least 2014, targeting a variety of industries, primarily in Russia, but also globally. They use a two-stage spear phishing process, initially sending a reconnaissance spear phish to gather information, followed by a second spear phish containing a remote template to deliver a payload.",
        "Initial Access": "The Inception attackers exploit a year-old Office vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, to gain initial access to European targets. They use remote templates in Microsoft Word, which allows them to load an external template when the document is opened.",
        "Execution": "The Inception attackers deploy a PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER, which cleans up forensic evidence after itself. It is used to fingerprint the machine, upload information to the C&C, and potentially run a secondary payload.",
        "Persistence": "POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Word\\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Inception attackers use anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process to prevent clues from being left on disk or in the registry. They also use a basic backdoor, POWERSHOWER, as a first stage to make it harder for researchers to analyze more sophisticated payloads.",
        "Discovery": "POWERSHOWER collects system information on the infected machine and sends it to the C2 server.",
        "Command and Control": "POWERSHOWER communicates with a C2 server, sending system information and receiving instructions. It enters a communications loop after a reboot, performing actions based on the status code of a GET request.",
        "Others": "Palo Alto Networks' Wildfire detects all current Inception remote template documents and the downloaded CVE-2017-11882 RTFs with malware verdicts. AutoFocus customers can track associated samples with the InceptionRemoteTemplate and PowerShower. Traps blocks all files associated with this campaign. Indicators of Compromise include various remote template documents, PowerShower samples, and IP addresses associated with Inception Remote Template documents."
