        "Defense Evasion": "Following the disclosure, the attackers moved their C&C domains to new IP addresses and released a new version of the malware, which no longer records videos but continues to steal files. The new version also checks for the presence of antivirus products from Kaspersky, Trend Micro, and Avast. Despite the encoding technique and key used by the attackers remaining unchanged, experts believe the threat group was unaware of the security firm's report.",
        "Command and Control": "The security firm Palo Alto Networks initially managed to take control of all but one of the C&C domains used by the attackers, preventing the group from stealing information from most victims. After publishing its report on Infy, Palo Alto Networks worked with entities hosting the threat actor's C&C infrastructure to take control of their domains. However, the attackers attempted to revive the campaign using the remaining C&C domains they controlled. Eventually, all domains were sinkholed, completely shutting down the campaign.",
        "Others": "Researchers at Palo Alto Networks disrupted an Iran-linked cyberespionage campaign targeting global governments and businesses. The malware, 'Infy,' had been used in espionage since at least 2007 and remained undetected due to highly targeted attacks. Over 450 malware agents were found on 326 systems across 35 countries, with many victims being Iranian citizens. More than 40 variants of Infy exist, with two major versions: the original Infy and the more sophisticated Infy M, the latter mainly targeting high-value individuals. Despite the disruption, researchers anticipate the threat actor's return."
