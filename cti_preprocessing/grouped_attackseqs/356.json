        "Execution": "The CTI report from Unit 42, authored by Jen Miller-Osborn and Mike Harbison on December 17, 2019, details the execution of a custom malware named Dudell by the cyber espionage group Rancor. Dudell is a weaponized Microsoft Excel document containing a malicious macro that executes upon enabling content. The macro executes data under the Company field, which downloads a second stage payload using msiexec from the C2 server 199.247.6[.]253. The report also mentions a VBScript named Chrome.vbs associated with Rancor, which beacons to the domain bafunpda[.]xyz and contains packed data to infect targets with chained persistent artifacts.",
        "Command and Control": "Rancor's malware Dudell communicates with a C2 server at 199.247.6[.]253. The DDKONG plugin malware beacons to cswksfwq.kfesv[.]xyz on TCP port 8080, transmitting victim information and supporting various capabilities such as process termination and file manipulation. KHRat malware beacons to connect.bafunpda[.]xyz on TCP port 8081, and the VBScript Chrome.vbs also communicates with bafunpda[.]xyz.",
        "Others": "The cyber espionage group Rancor has been active since at least 2017, targeting Southeast Asia with custom malware such as Dudell, DDKONG plugin, and KHRat. Rancor also uses the Derusbi malware family, which is a backdoor Trojan loader that loads an encrypted payload. Palo Alto Networks' threat prevention platform detects these malware families, and their URL filtering solution updates the 'malware' category for compromised domains. AutoFocus customers can investigate this activity with specific tags provided in the report."
