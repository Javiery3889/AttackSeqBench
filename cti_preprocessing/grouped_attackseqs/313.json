    "rewrite": {
        "Initial Access": "In April 2019, enSilo detected new activity by APT10, a Chinese cyber espionage group, in Southeast Asia. The group employed a tactic known as DLL Side-Loading, where a legitimate executable, jjs.exe, was abused to load a malicious DLL, jli.dll, instead of the legitimate one it depended on. This method was used to inject a shellcode into svchost.exe, which contained the actual malicious payload.",
        "Execution": "The malicious DLL, jli.dll, mapped the data file svchost.bin to memory and decrypted it, revealing a shellcode that was injected into svchost.exe. This process resembled previous versions used by APT10 in PlugX/RedLeaves malware. The injection flow involved creating a process in a suspended state, allocating memory, writing the shellcode, and executing it remotely.",
        "Persistence": "APT10's first loader variant used a service as its persistence method, installing jjs.exe as the service and starting it. The service names observed included WxUpdateServiceInfo, HxUpdateServiceInfo, WinDefendSec, Web_Client, clr_optimization_v4.0.30319_31, and clr_optimization_v4.0.30319_37. The second variant used the Run registry key for the current user under the name 'Windows Updata' to ensure persistence.",
        "Defense Evasion": "APT10's loader implemented a decryption and injection mechanism to evade defenses. The PlugX payload used by APT10 replaced the DOS and NT headers' magic values with 'VX' to prevent security products from identifying executable headers during memory scans. Additionally, the malware authors wrapped memory allocation and release with dummy calls to GetForegroundWindow API function to generate noise and evade detection.",
        "Command and Control": "APT10 used Command and Control (C&C) servers located in South Korea. The first loader variant's domain (ffca[.]caibi379[.]com) resolved to IP addresses listed under 'DAOU TECHNOLOGY' in South Korea. The domain was registered in Hong Kong. The PlugX's domains resolved to IP addresses that were also associated with other domains used by APT10, indicating the same group operated both variants.",
        "Others": "APT10 delivered different payloads, including PlugX and Quasar RATs, with PlugX being developed in-house by the group. The Quasar RAT contained an addition of SharpSploit to extract passwords using mimikatz capabilities. The samples analyzed originated from the Philippines, and the activity was consistent with APT10's history of targeting Southeast Asia. The group used typosquatting domain names to pose as legitimate tech companies and employed unique malware families associated with them. The threat actor behind APT10 is still active, and the recent activity may be part of a testing environment or a short-lived attack."
