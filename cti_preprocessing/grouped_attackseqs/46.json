        "Initial Access": "The Citizen Lab reported targeted malware attacks against Tibetan organizations, which involved the distribution of LURK malware through socially engineered emails. These emails contained password-protected Microsoft Office files with the password provided in the email body. The attackers used sensitive content from Tibetan groups, suggesting a preliminary level of infiltration.",
        "Execution": "The LURK malware, once executed, connects to a command-and-control server at dtl.dnsd.me:63 (184.105.64.183) and uses a backup domain dtl.eatuo.com:63 if the primary server is inaccessible. Both domains are associated with dynamic DNS providers, and eatuo.com shares registration information with the Chinese provider 3322.net.",
        "Persistence": "The LURK trojan creates a link in the Startup folder to maintain persistence on the infected system. The launcher binary is located in %AppData% and is named iexplore.exe. The trojan also uses additional files for persistence, including CREATELINK.EXE, IconCacheEt.DAT, IconConfigEt.DAT, and a copy of iexplore.exe in the %AppData%\\Help directory.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware attacks used password-protected Office documents to evade detection. The passwords were four-digit numeric codes, possibly chosen to reflect dates of historical significance to Tibet. This technique may prevent antivirus software from detecting the malicious payload or vulnerabilities used.",
        "Command and Control": "The LURK malware communicates with a command-and-control server using the IP address 184.105.64.183 and ports such as 63, 81, and 53. The server's open ports include 21/tcp, 53/tcp, 135/tcp, 1026/tcp, and 8080/tcp. The malware checks for a registry value at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DbxUpdateET\\ and sets it with the campaign name if not found.",
        "Others": "The Citizen Lab's research brief documents the use of information operations against Tibetans and advocates for Tibetan rights. It is the third in a series and analyzes 11 malicious emails sent between May and July 2012. The emails targeted at least three separate organizations and used four distinct messages with Microsoft Office documents as attachments. The malware payloads communicated with the same command-and-control server and used campaign names suggesting specificity to the Tibetan community. The Citizen Lab provides recommendations for civil society organizations to defend against such targeted cyber threats."
