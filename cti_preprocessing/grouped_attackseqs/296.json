        "Initial Access": "On June 12, 2015, Volexity reported a strategic web compromise (SWC) against the Afghan Government's content delivery network (CDN) server, cdn.afghanistan.af. This server, which provides Javascript code to several Afghan government websites, was found to be serving malicious code. Visitors to websites such as the President of Afghanistan's site (www.president.gov.af) were affected. The attackers modified the Javascript file jquery-1.4.2.min.js hosted on the CDN to load additional malicious code from the IP address 176.58.101.24.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers behind the Afghan Government compromise obfuscated their malicious code by appending it to the end of the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file and using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding. This made it more difficult to discern the attackers' actions just by looking at the code.",
        "Others": "The threat actors involved in the Afghan Government compromise employed IP address whitelisting, suggesting that they likely have a specific set of targets for their campaign. Volexity observed that all attempts to communicate with the malicious IP address 176.58.101.24 resulted in HTTP 403 (Forbidden) responses, indicating selective exploitation. The attackers have used similar tactics in past strategic web compromises. The primary network indicator for this activity is communication with the IP address 176.58.101.24, which is associated with Linode LLC and has ASN details provided by the Shadowserver IP-BGP service."
