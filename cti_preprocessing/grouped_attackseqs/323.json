        "Initial Access": "In early July 2015, Chinese APT actors exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) by embedding it within a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) that detailed a legal case between the Philippines and China. The exploit was strategically placed on the PCA website during the tribunal, targeting visitors interested in the case.",
        "Execution": "The malware payload identified as Rdws.exe, a dropper executable, deployed its main component via a DLL sideloading technique. It used the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe) to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll), which then loaded a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers used a sideloading technique to evade defenses, deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable. The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware connected back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org and the subdomain ssl.nicklockluckydog[.]org for command and control. The domain ssl.nicklockluckydog[.]org resolved to an IP address in Seoul, South Korea, at the time of analysis.",
        "Others": "The attackers compromised the PCA webpages and altered them to load the malicious URL containing the Flash exploit. The domain used for the exploit was registered using falsified information. ThreatConnect shared details of the incident within Incident 20150710D: Permanent Court of Arbitration Flash Exploit."
