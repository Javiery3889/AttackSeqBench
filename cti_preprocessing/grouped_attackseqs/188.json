        "Initial Access": "The Elderwood Project attackers have been deploying zero-day exploits through spear phishing emails and increasingly through Web injections in watering hole attacks. They have used a variety of zero-day exploits, including CVE-2012-0779, CVE-2012-1875, CVE-2012-1889, and CVE-2012-1535, to gain initial access to their targets. These attacks have been systematically targeting industries such as defense, NGOs, and IT service providers.",
        "Command and Control": "The Elderwood Project attackers have established command and control (C&C) servers to control compromised systems. Some of the C&C domains identified include qwby.gownsman.com, wwwcnas.org, gate-usa.com, and several others. These servers are used to retrieve commands from the attackers and maintain control over the victim's computer.",
        "Others": "The Elderwood Project, monitored by Symantec, involves a group that has been consistently targeting various industries for the past three years. The group is known for using an unlimited number of zero-day exploits and has been linked to the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse attack on Google in 2009. The attackers have developed an attack platform, termed the 'Elderwood platform,' which allows them to quickly deploy zero-day exploits. The group's systematic approach and reuse of components indicate a high level of technical capability, suggesting the backing of a large criminal organization, nation-state support, or a nation-state itself. The Elderwood gang has been responsible for compromising numerous websites, corporations, and individuals, focusing on the wholesale theft of intellectual property. Symantec has provided various protection measures against these threats, including file-based protection, network-based protection, behavior-based protection, reputation-based protection, and email-based protection."
