        "Initial Access": "Proofpoint researchers observed phishing campaigns beginning on July 10, 2019, targeting U.S. utility providers with portable executable (PE) attachments and subject lines such as 'PowerSafe energy educational courses (30-days trial)'. These campaigns continued through September 2019. In November 2019, the threat actors shifted from PE attachments to malicious macro-laden Microsoft Word documents.",
        "Execution": "The FlowCloud macro used privacy-enhanced mail ('.pem') files which were subsequently renamed to 'pense1.txt'. This file is then saved as a portable executable file named 'gup.exe' and executed using a version of the certutil.exe tool named 'Temptcm.tmp'. The FlowCloud macro introduced a new method for the delivery of the malware, utilizing a previously unobserved macro section to download the payload from a DropBox URL. If unable to retrieve the payload from that resource, a catch statement attempted to retrieve a malware resource from the URL http://ffca.caibi379[.]com/rwjh/qtinfo.txt.",
        "Persistence": "The FlowCloud malware begins with the execution of 'Gup.exe' by the malicious macro which in turn executes the file 'EhStorAuthn.exe'. 'EhStorAuthn.exe' extracts the subsequent payload file components and installs them to the directory C:\\Windows\\Media\\SystemPCAXD\\ado\\fc. This file also sets registry key values that store the keylogger drivers and the malware configuration as the value 'KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\PrintResponsor\\<2-4>'.",
        "Command and Control": "FlowCloud malware handles configuration updates, file exfiltration, and commands as independent threads utilizing a custom binary C2 protocol. The sample analyzed utilized port 55555 for file exfiltration and port 55556 for all other data. FlowCloud communication was identified with the IP 188.131.233[.]27.",
        "Others": "Proofpoint researchers reported that LookBack malware targeted the U.S. utilities sector between July and August 2019. They continued their analysis into additional LookBack campaigns that unfolded between August 21-29, 2019. These campaigns utilized malicious macro-laden documents to deliver modular malware to targeted utility providers across the U.S. At the same time, Proofpoint identified a new malware family named FlowCloud, which gives attackers complete control over a compromised system. Both LookBack and FlowCloud malware can be attributed to a single threat actor called TA410, based on shared attachment macros, malware installation techniques, and overlapping delivery infrastructure. TA410 campaigns detected in November 2019 included TA429 (APT10)-related infrastructure used in phishing attachment delivery macros. However, Proofpoint analysts believe that intentional reuse of TA429 (APT10) techniques and infrastructure may be an attempt by threat actors to create a false flag. Therefore, they do not attribute LookBack and FlowCloud campaigns to TA429 (APT10) and track TA429 (APT10) independently of TA410 campaigns."
