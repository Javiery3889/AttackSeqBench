        "Initial Access": "The attack, known as Zombie Zero, was initiated through the delivery of weaponized malware embedded in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application used by logistics and shipping industries worldwide. The malware was delivered from a Chinese factory and was also found in a version of Windows XP installed on the hardware at the manufacturer's location in China, as well as on the manufacturer's support website.",
        "Persistence": "The malware persisted in the Windows XP embedded version located at the Chinese manufacturer's support website hosted in China.",
        "Discovery": "Once connected to the wireless network, the malware began an automated attack using the SMB protocol. At Site 1, with network segmentation and a firewall, the SMB attack was blocked, but a secondary attack using the RADMIN protocol infected over nine servers. At Site 2, without a firewall, the SMB attack succeeded. The malware specifically targeted servers with 'finance' in their hostname, compromising the ERP financial server.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware facilitated the upload of a standby weaponized payload that established a command and control connection to a Chinese botnet terminating at the Lanxiang Vocational School in the China Unicom Shandong province network. A more sophisticated command and control of the company's finance server was established, along with a secondary stealth botnet CnC network terminating in Beijing.",
        "Exfiltration": "All financial data and ERP data were exfiltrated, providing the attacker with complete situational awareness and visibility into the logistics/shipping company's worldwide operations."
