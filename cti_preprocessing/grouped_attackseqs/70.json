        "Initial Access": "Sebdraven discovered a new dropper with the signature matching previous ones but with a changed exploitation method. Previously, it utilized an ole package to drop a file in %appdata% and decode a legitimate file along with a backdoor such as PlugX, newcore rat, sysfader. The current version maps a large ole object in memory and drops files using a PE. The RTF exploits CVE-2017_1882 on eqnedt32.exe, with the largest object being a new exe that overwrites the first eqnedt32.exe, decoded by the shellcode from the exploit.",
        "Execution": "The PE dropper creates a directory named IISWebClient in %appdata%, decrypts a buffer in its address space with XOR, decompresses, and drops three files: iassvcs.exe (signed by Symantec), sqlite3.dll (signed by av 360), and RasTls.dll (the backdoor). The dropper executes iassvcs.exe for side loading and persistence, reloading the executable with each command line execution.",
        "Persistence": "The dropper ensures persistence by executing iassvcs.exe, which is reloaded with each executable or command line execution.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The dropper uses a side loading technique by executing iassvcs.exe to maintain persistence and evade defenses.",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoor communicates with the domain hxxps://skylineqaz.crabdance.com/, which resolves to the IP 154.223.167.20. This IP is associated with tele.zyns.com and infrastructures used by Chinese APT or DDOS teams against former Soviet republics. The domain uzwatersource.dynamic-dns.net, used by Icefog, connects to tele.zyns.com via 150.129.80.184. Additionally, tajikstantravel.dynamic-dns.net is connected to a Chinese DDOS infrastructure.",
        "Others": "The dropper was submitted by an ID from Kazakhstan, suggesting that Goblin Panda may be targeting this region. The dropper's SHA256 is c580d77722d85238ed76689a17b0205b4d980c010bef9616b8611ffba21b142e. Dropped files include RasTls.dll, iassvcs.exe, and sqlite3.dll with their respective SHA256 hashes. DNS requests were made to skylineqaz.crabdance.com and xn--ylineqaz-y25ja.crabdance.com. Connections were made to IP 154.223.167.20, and HTTP/HTTPS requests were sent to https://skylineqaz.crabdance.com/. The domains tele.zyns.com, uzwatersource.dynamic-dns.net, and tajikstantravel.dynamic-dns.net are also mentioned in relation to Goblin Panda and Icefog activities."
