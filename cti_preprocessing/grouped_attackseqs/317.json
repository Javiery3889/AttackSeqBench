        "Initial Access": "The Anomali Threat Research Team identified an ongoing campaign by Mustang Panda using spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files likely as the distribution method. These files contained embedded HTA scripts that, once executed, dropped and opened decoy documents while running malicious payloads in the background.",
        "Execution": "The '.lnk' files used by Mustang Panda typically contained an embedded HTA file with VBscript or PowerShell script that executed various operations including dropping Cobalt Strike Stagers and opening decoy documents. The PlugX malware was also delivered as a primary payload.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Mustang Panda utilized the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to deceive users into opening malicious files. They also used PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads, which align with previous findings of activity attributed to Mustang Panda by CrowdStrike.",
        "Command and Control": "Mustang Panda's campaign involved command and control (C2) domains and IP addresses that were used to communicate with the compromised systems. The documents were attempting to, or were able to connect to various C2 domains and IP addresses.",
        "Others": "The Anomali Threat Research Team discovered an ongoing campaign by Mustang Panda targeting minority groups, public and private sector organizations. The campaign dates back to at least November 2018 and possibly as far back as October 2017. Targets include individuals interested in United Nations' Security Council Committee resolutions, Mongolian-based MIAT Airlines, non-profit China Center, and countries such as Germany, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Vietnam. The Communist Party of Vietnam (CVP) and the Shan Tai group were also targeted. The campaign's objectives align with China's strategic interests, including its 13th Five-Year Plan and the Belt and Road Initiative."
