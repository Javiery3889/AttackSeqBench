        "Initial Access": "The Inception Framework utilized initial access techniques by embedding malware components within Rich Text Format (RTF) files, exploiting vulnerabilities such as CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158 to gain remote access to victims' computers. These documents were distributed via spear phishing emails, targeting individuals such as the CEO of a large Russian bank. The weaponized documents contained two separate exploits, triggering the execution of the malicious payload upon opening.",
        "Command and Control": "The Inception Framework's command-and-control infrastructure was cloud-based, leveraging the WebDAV protocol for communication. This allowed the malware to send instructions and receive exfiltrated information from compromised systems via a cloud service provider, CloudMe.com. The malware components followed a plugin model, where new malware relied on previously delivered components to interact with the framework. The attackers used a cloud service to perform target surveying, configuration updates, malware updates, and data exfiltration.",
        "Others": "The Inception Framework demonstrated a high level of operational security, with attackers interacting with their infrastructure through a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts. The attackers' identities remained concealed, with only a few clues left behind, preventing accurate attribution. The framework was highly automated and target-agnostic, capable of adapting to targets globally. The attackers showed interest in various sectors, including embassies, politics, finance, military, and engineering. The malware used for the Inception Framework was sophisticated, with multiple layers of obfuscation and indirection, including the use of polymorphic techniques to evade detection. The attackers also targeted mobile devices with malware disguised as updates for popular messaging applications like WhatsApp and Viber, as well as MMS phishing content tailored to specific mobile operators. The campaign evolved to include targets worldwide, indicating a large-scale operation with potential backing from nation-states or resourceful private entities."
