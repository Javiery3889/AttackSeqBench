        "Reconnaissance": "The Taidoor malware campaign begins with a spear-phishing email sent to targets, which may include government agencies, corporate entities, and think tanks, particularly those with interests in Taiwan. The email entices recipients to open an attached file, which, if executed on a vulnerable system, silently installs malware.",
        "Initial Access": "The Taidoor malware is delivered via email attachments. When the attachment is opened, it exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) to drop the malware onto the target's system. A decoy document containing legitimate content is simultaneously opened to alleviate any suspicions.",
        "Execution": "The Taidoor malware, once installed, begins to beacon to a command-and-control (CnC) server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern that includes an encrypted MAC address of the compromised computer.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Taidoor has evolved to avoid common network detection signatures. The new variant uses a 'downloader' that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, which is then decrypted to a modified version of the Taidoor malware. This variant has also changed its network traffic pattern to avoid detection.",
        "Command and Control": "The new Taidoor variant communicates with two CnC servers: roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw. The network traffic, or 'callback,' has been modified from the traditional version to use different file path names and formats.",
        "Others": "The Taidoor malware has been active since 2008 and continues to be used in cyber espionage campaigns. It has undergone significant tactical changes in 2011 and 2012. The malware is not off-the-shelf and suggests a connection between various activities using Taidoor. Another malware family, 'Taleret,' uses a similar technique to Taidoor for CnC server communication. There is a frequent association with Taiwan and a similar CnC naming scheme between Taidoor and Taleret."
