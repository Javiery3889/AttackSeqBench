        "Initial Access": "The organized criminal group employed targeted emailing (spear phishing) and infections from other botnets as their primary methods for penetrating internal networks. Since August 2014, the group began creating their own large botnet using mass emailing, but not typical exploit drive-by infections, likely to reduce the need for external contacts.",
        "Execution": "The group used various tools for their attacks, including Mimikatz to get passwords, MBR Eraser to crack operating systems, SoftPerfect Network Scanner for LAN scanning, Cain & Abel and SSHD backdoor for password retrieval and remote access, and Ammy Admin and Team Viewer for remote control. The core malware Anunak, along with these tools, was used to carry out targeted attacks, mainly on banks and payment systems.",
        "Persistence": "The attackers gained access to ATM management infrastructure and infected those systems with their own malicious software, allowing theft from the banks' ATM systems on command. They also gained access to email and workflow servers, server and banking system administrator workstations, and configured remote access to servers of interest, including firewall configuration changes.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers used the program RDPdoor for remote access and the program 'MBR Eraser' to remove traces and crack Windows computers and servers. They also used legitimate programs such as Ammy Admin and Team Viewer for remote access to reduce the risk of losing access to the internal bank network.",
        "Credential Access": "The attackers compromised domain administrator passwords and gained access to all active domain accounts, including email servers, which allowed them to control all internal communications and take countermeasures against bank employees' efforts to solve the problem.",
        "Lateral Movement": "The attackers used Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, escalating privileges, gathering credentials, and hopping onto other systems and networks. They also used VNC scanning and password brute forcing, added additional administrator accounts, and used RDP Wrapper to allow concurrent RDP sessions to gain access and achieve persistent access to compromised systems.",
        "Command and Control": "The Anunak malware connected to backends using a PHP based backend reachable over HTTP and HTTPS, and a Windows server based component using a proprietary protocol. Various stealth methods including backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling were used for compromise persistence and data exfiltration.",
        "Impact": "The attackers changed denominations of issued banknotes in the ATM operating system registry, allowing them to withdraw large amounts of cash directly from ATMs. They also used a modified debug program that allowed them to issue money from the dispenser without opening the ATM housing and the vault door."
