        "Initial Access": "The OceanLotus group (APT32) has been using a new custom downloader malware named 'KerrDown' since early 2018. Two methods were identified for delivering KerrDown to targets: Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros and RAR archives containing legitimate programs with DLL side-loading. The RAR file names used to trick targets are in Vietnamese, indicating that the primary targets are either in Vietnam or Vietnamese speaking individuals.",
        "Execution": "The malicious Office document contains an image file with a message in Vietnamese, asking the victim to enable macros to view the contents. The document has two different base64 blobs inserted in separate tables, with the font size changed to 1 to potentially evade detection. Depending on the victim's system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), the appropriate base64 encoded blob is decoded and executed.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The actors reused a VBS decode function published by Motobit to decode base64 blobs. The KerrDown DLL is dropped in the directory 'Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\' as 'main_background.png'. The DLL retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it using the DES algorithm, and executes it in memory, ensuring that only the KerrDown DLL downloader is saved on the system and the payload is executed directly in memory without being written to the system.",
        "Command and Control": "The final payload of KerrDown, which was active during the time of analysis, turned out to be a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon. This commercial penetration testing tool has been used by various threat actors in their campaigns. The KerrDown downloader attempts to download the payload from a URL depending on the OS architecture of the victim machine.",
        "Others": "Analysis of compile timestamps of KerrDown samples suggests that OceanLotus has been using the downloader since at least March 2018 and continues to actively use it. A pattern in the group's working hours was discerned, indicating a typical 9 AM to 6 PM working pattern in GMT+7, with most samples compiled during this period and on weekdays, suggesting formal working hours and operations likely out of Vietnam or nearby countries. The group's broader geographic and industry-wide target base may indicate the use of similar tools and playbooks against other targets.
