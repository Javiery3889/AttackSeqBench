        "Initial Access": "The MuddyWater campaign, first identified in 2017, has been observed using a new sample (Detected as W2KM_DLOADR.UHAOEEN) in May 2018, which utilizes a Microsoft Word document embedded with a malicious macro. This macro is designed to execute PowerShell scripts leading to a backdoor payload, notably without downloading additional component files but encoding all scripts within the document itself.",
        "Execution": "Upon enabling the macro within the lure document, the Document_Open() event triggers the execution of the malicious routine. This involves the use of three main functions: one to execute sub-functions, another to manipulate images in the document, and a third to construct and execute the main PowerShell commands and scripts.",
        "Persistence": "The PowerShell script decodes the contents of the malicious document and executes another encoded PowerShell script. This results in readable scripts that drop various components into the %Application Data%\\Microsoft\\CLR\\* directory. The main PowerShell file, invoker.ps1, uses these components to run the final payload, PRB-Backdoor.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The campaign employs obfuscation methods for the macro scripts, resulting in an intended backdoor payload. This method is commonly used in samples associated with the MuddyWater campaign.",
        "Command and Control": "The PRB-Backdoor communicates with its Command-and-Control (C&C) server, hxxp://outl00k[.]net, to send and receive commands for various purposes, including initializing connection, registering the machine, gathering browsing histories, stealing passwords, reading and writing files, executing shell commands, recording keyboard strokes, capturing screenshots, updating functions, and gathering system information.",
        "Others": "The MuddyWater campaign targets users through phishing or spam, using lure documents designed with social engineering tactics. Trend Micro solutions such as Deep Discovery, Hosted Email Security, Deep Discovery Email Inspector, InterScan Web Security, and Smart Protection Suites provide protection against such attacks. The campaign has evolved its tools and techniques to be more effective and persistent, with the latest sample indicating a shift in the subject matter of lure documents, suggesting a broader range of targets."
