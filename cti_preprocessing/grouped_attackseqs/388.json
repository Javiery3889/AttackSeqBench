        "Initial Access": "On August 24, 2014, a spear phishing email was sent to a Taiwanese government ministry with a malicious Microsoft Word document attached, exploiting CVE-2012-0158. The email appeared to originate from a compromised account of another Taiwanese Government employee. Similarly, on August 25, 2014, spear phishing emails were sent to a technology company in Taiwan and a high-technology company in Japan, both containing malicious documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Following Arbor Networks' article in June 2014, APT12 modified the RIPTIDE backdoor to avoid detection, resulting in the creation of the HIGHTIDE malware family. The changes were significant enough to circumvent existing detection rules. APT12 also used the THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT backdoors, which shared similarities with HIGHTIDE, indicating a pattern of evolving tactics to evade defenses.",
        "Command and Control": "The RIPTIDE backdoor, used by APT12 from March 2011 to May 2014, communicated via HTTP with a hard-coded C2 server to fetch an encryption key for further encrypted communication. The HIGHTIDE backdoor, observed in use on August 24, 2014, connected directly to the IP address 141.108.2.157. The THREEBYTE backdoor communicated with the domain video[.]csmcpr[.]com, and the WATERSPOUT backdoor connected to icc[.]ignorelist[.]com.",
        "Others": "APT12, also known as IXESHE, DynCalc, and DNSCALC, linked to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, resumed operations targeting Japan and Taiwan after a pause due to media exposure. FireEye identified APT12's use of modified and new backdoors, including RIPTIDE, HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT, following public disclosures. APT12's activities align with the People's Republic of China's interests in Taiwan. The group's ability to quickly adapt to exposures with new tools and tactics suggests they will continue to evolve to stay ahead of network defenders."
