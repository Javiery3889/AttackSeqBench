        "Initial Access": "The FireEye Threat Intelligence team reported that two Chinese APT groups, APT3 and APT18, launched phishing campaigns exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) disclosed in the Hacking Team data leak. The campaigns targeted multiple industries, including aerospace and defense, construction and engineering, education, energy, health and biotechnology, high tech, non-profit, telecommunications, and transportation. APT3's phishing emails contained URLs that resolved to the IP address 194.44.130.179 and redirected to JavaScript profilers and a malicious Adobe Flash file. This file downloaded an obfuscated GIF with a SHOTPUT payload, a DLL backdoor capable of various system manipulations, communicating over HTTP to hardcoded command and control (CnC) addresses. APT18's phishing emails prompted victims to download a malicious Adobe Flash update, which upon exploitation, delivered a GH0ST RAT variant calling out to a known APT18 CnC address 223.25.233.248.",
        "Command and Control": "APT3's SHOTPUT backdoor communicates with CnC addresses hardcoded into the malware, including psa.perrydale[.]com, link.angellroofing[.]com, 107.20.255.57, and 23.99.20.198. APT18's GH0ST RAT variant calls out to a previously known APT18 CnC address 223.25.233.248.",
        "Others": "FireEye Threat Intelligence suggests that both APT3 and APT18 are adaptable and skilled, as evidenced by their quick use of the leaked zero-day vulnerability before it was patched. They likely monitor security research to learn about available exploits and adapt their tactics accordingly. FireEye has observed APT3 modifying its phishing emails and backdoor in response to public research exposure. Both groups have a history of developing or adapting zero-day exploits for planned operations, and the use of data from the Hacking Team leak shows their ability to shift resources to take advantage of new exploits. FireEye recommends applying Adobe's patch for Flash, querying for additional activity by source addresses or email indicators, blocking CnC addresses, and preparing for incident response."
