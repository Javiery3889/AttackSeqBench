        "Resource Development": "Resource Development: The attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains (wordkeyvpload[.]net, wordkeyvpload[.]org) and developed capabilities including malware (Graphite malware) and tools (Empire). These resources were used to support the operation, with domains purchased to serve as command and control servers, malicious components built to conduct the attack, and red teaming tools employed.",
        "Initial Access": "Initial Access: The adversaries initiated the attack by sending spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment (BM-D(2021)0247.xlsx) to gain access to victim systems. They exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444) to execute code on the victim's machine.",
        "Execution": "Execution: The adversaries exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability for client execution and abused PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager) for the execution of the Empire stager.",
        "Persistence": "Persistence: The adversaries established persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects (CLSID: D9144DCD-E998-4ECA-AB6A-DCD83CCBA16D). They also created a local account (net user /add user1) to maintain access to victim systems.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Defense Evasion: The adversaries used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.",
        "Command and Control": "Command and Control: The adversaries created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel (use of different Empire stagers) and used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication. They also employed symmetric (AES 256) and asymmetric encryption to conceal command and control traffic."
