        "Initial Access": "The CTI report indicates that the threat actors behind the Emissary Trojan, associated with Operation Lotus Blossom, shifted their tactics from solely using spear-phishing with attachments to also compromising legitimate websites to host their malware. This shift in tactics suggests an adaptation to increase the odds of successful infiltration.",
        "Persistence": "The Emissary Trojan is capable of maintaining persistence on a targeted system. It achieves this by writing itself to %SYSTEM%\\WSPsvc.dll and installing as a service to run the exported function 'ServiceMain'. Additionally, it creates registry keys to store encrypted configuration and a unique GUID for the compromised host. Persistence is also achieved through various methods such as hijacking legitimate services or adding startup code, depending on the user's permissions.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Emissary Trojan authors have made several updates to the malware to evade detection. These updates include changes in configuration storage, handling of commands, and the introduction of large file sizes to avoid antivirus scanning. The actors also recompiled the Trojan without changes to avoid detection based on PE header hashes.",
        "Command and Control": "The Emissary Trojan communicates with command and control (C2) servers using HTTP requests. It typically has three hardcoded C2s that are a mix of IPs and domain names. The C2 infrastructure used by Emissary is somewhat different from that used by the related Elise Trojan. The report includes a full list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to the C2 infrastructure.",
        "Others": "The CTI report details the evolution of the Emissary Trojan, which has been in use since 2009 and is related to the Elise Trojan and Operation Lotus Blossom campaign. The report provides a timeline of the development efforts and changes made to the Emissary Trojan over the years, including the creation of multiple versions with iterative changes. The report also notes that the development effort for Emissary significantly increased after the publication of the Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015, resulting in many new versions of the Trojan. Additionally, the report includes a changelog section discussing the observed changes between each version of Emissary, highlighting the malware's capability to exfiltrate files, download and execute additional payloads, and gain remote shell access. The report concludes that the actors behind Emissary have been active for at least seven years, targeting primarily military or government entities in Southeast Asia, with a focus on Taiwan and Hong Kong. The report also includes a list of Emissary delivery documents, installers/loaders, DLL versions, C2 URLs, and campaign codes."
