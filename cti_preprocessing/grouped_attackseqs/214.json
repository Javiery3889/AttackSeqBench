        "Initial Access": "APT28 has engaged in spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access to target networks. They have used spear-phishing emails containing malicious URLs designed to harvest email credentials or deliver exploit documents that deploy malware onto users' systems. For instance, APT28 registered domains spoofing legitimate organizations and webmail services to deceive victims into providing their credentials or accessing malicious documents. They exploited vulnerabilities such as Flash Vulnerability CVE-2016-7855 and Windows Vulnerability CVE-2016-7255 to install malware on victims who visited a malicious URL.",
        "Execution": "APT28 has been observed executing malware on victim systems through spear-phishing emails that deliver exploit documents. These documents exploit vulnerabilities to install malware such as GAMEFISH onto the targeted machines. APT28's malware suite includes tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, GAMEFISH, SOURFACE, OLDBAIT, and CORESHELL, each serving roles such as backdoors, downloaders, and credential harvesters.",
        "Defense Evasion": "APT28 has demonstrated the ability to evade defenses by leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities, using public code depositories for development, and obtaining credentials through fabricated authorization requests. They have also shown a preference for using legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, sometimes foregoing their traditional toolset.",
        "Credential Access": "APT28 has used spear-phishing to harvest credentials, often by directing victims to fake login pages or by asking them to authorize malicious applications that bypass security measures like two-factor authentication. They have also employed credential harvesters like OLDBAIT within their malware suite.",
        "Lateral Movement": "APT28 has used strategic web compromises (SWC) to infect users with malware by redirecting them from compromised legitimate sites. They have also exploited known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into victim networks.",
        "Others": "APT28, attributed to the Russian Government, has been active since at least 2007, targeting political entities, governments, militaries, and other organizations. They have been involved in information operations, including data leaks and false flag operations, to influence foreign politics. Notable incidents include the compromise of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), where stolen data was strategically leaked. APT28's operations align with Russian strategic interests and military doctrine, and they are expected to continue similar efforts in future political events."
