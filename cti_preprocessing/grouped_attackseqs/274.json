        "Initial Access": "In early July, CrowdStrike's Falcon Host technology detected an attack leveraging the CVE-2015-5119 exploit code that was publicly exposed after the breach of the European information security company Hacking Team. The exploit was hosted at www[.]cbppnews[.]com/movie.swf, which CrowdStrike speculates was meant to spoof the website of the US-based think tank \"Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\". Upon successful exploitation, a file was saved at \"%Temp%/Rdws.exe\" which is executed and writes another file at \"%TEMP%/adobe.dat.\" This file was used as a first stage downloader to retrieve a second stage PlugX file that connected to several C2 domains beginning with cdn[.]sanecat[.]com. Analysis of this first stage downloader revealed it to be a new variant of Sakula malware.",
        "Command and Control": "The INOCNATION Campaign involved a new variant of Sakula malware that conducted C2 communications with the domain inocnation[.]com. The Ironman Campaign involved Sakula malware that communicated with a C2 IP address of 180.210.206.246. The French Aerospace Campaign involved Sakula connecting to a C2 domain of oa[.]ameteksen[.]com. The Sakula malware has been linked to the use of a number of zero-day exploits and high-profile incidents such as those resulting in healthcare and government data breach notifications earlier this year.",
        "Others": "The Sakula malware variant has been linked to several significant targeted intrusion campaigns over the past 2-3 years, including the \"French Aerospace\" Campaign and the \"Ironman\" Campaign. CrowdStrike has observed limited use of what appears to be a third Sakula variant. Sakula is assessed as a limited-release tool in use by multiple adversaries. There is an apparent connection between the use of Sakula and PlugX, with evidence that Sakula and PlugX samples have relied on the same C2 infrastructure. The Sakula malware demonstrates the difficulty of attribution and the rationale for bookending technical information with analytic judgments. It is likely used by a small subset of operators, which, given the access to zero-day exploits and high-profile operations, are likely well-resourced."
