        "Reconnaissance": "The Charming Kitten campaign, attributed to an Iranian APT group, has been actively engaging in reconnaissance by leveraging various impersonation vectors to target individuals of interest to Iran. These individuals include academic researchers, human rights activists, opposition to Iran's regime, journalists, and prominent Iranians living abroad. The campaign has utilized spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gather information such as phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor authentication, aiming to gain control of the victims' email accounts.",
        "Resource Development": "Charming Kitten has developed resources for their campaign by creating phishing sites that impersonate legitimate services such as Google Drive, Yahoo, and social networks like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. They have also prepared ZIP files with ready infrastructures for phishing sites using WordPress and CrunchPress interfaces, containing relevant files such as logos and personas to impersonate.",
        "Initial Access": "Charming Kitten has gained initial access through spear-phishing methods, including emails and SMS messages impersonating Google Drive, Yahoo services, and social networks. They have sent messages from seemingly known contacts or services, prompting victims to click on malicious links that lead to phishing sites designed to steal credentials.",
        "Defense Evasion": "To evade detection, Charming Kitten has used tactics such as redirecting victims to legitimate services after an attack, using self-signed digital certificates for phishing sites, and employing domain shortening services to conceal the actual malicious URLs.",
        "Credential Access": "Charming Kitten's primary goal has been to access credentials by directing victims to phishing pages that impersonate login pages for services like Google Drive and Yahoo. The victims are manipulated into entering their credentials, believing they are accessing legitimate services.",
        "Others": "Charming Kitten has been associated with the Ministry of Intelligence of Iran and has been active since 2014. The group has been known to target various entities, including U.S. presidential campaigns, government officials, and journalists. They have also been involved in campaigns to interfere with democratic procedures, historically attributed to Russian APT groups. ClearSky Security Ltd has been monitoring Charming Kitten's activities and has identified new domains and IPs associated with the group's infrastructure, indicating ongoing efforts to target Yahoo accounts and impersonate services such as Microsoft."
