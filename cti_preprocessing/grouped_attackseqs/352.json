        "Initial Access": "We discovered a new operation within a long-running cyber-espionage campaign in the Middle East. The operation targets Android users via the malicious Welcome Chat app, which is linked to the malware named BadPatch and the Gaza Hackers threat actor group, also known as Molerats. The app is advertised on a dedicated website in Arabic, suggesting a focus on Arabic-speaking users. The domain for this website was registered in October 2019.",
        "Persistence": "The Welcome Chat app is designed to auto-start at device boot by listening for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast, ensuring that its functionality is activated every time the device starts.",
        "Discovery": "The Welcome Chat app collects information about the device, including device info and GPS location.",
        "Collection": "The Welcome Chat app has the capability to exfiltrate sent and received SMS messages, call log history, contact list, user photos, recorded phone calls, and the GPS location of the device.",
        "Command and Control": "The Welcome Chat app sends information about the device to its command and control (C&C) server and is ready to receive commands. It contacts the C&C server every five minutes and uploads exfiltrated data using the HTTP protocol.",
        "Others": "The Welcome Chat app, which claims to be a secure messaging platform, is actually a functioning chat app with hidden espionage capabilities. It was never available on the official Android app store and requires permissions that are intrusive but may seem natural for a messaging app. The app's infrastructure was not built with security in mind, leaving harvested data from victims freely available on the internet via an unsecured server. The malicious code in the app appears to be copied from publicly available open-source projects and code snippets. The espionage app is believed to be developed by the attackers rather than being a trojanized version of a legitimate app. The campaign is linked to the threat actors behind the long-term BadPatch campaign. ESET researchers recommend not installing apps from outside the official Google Play store and to be cautious of app permissions."
