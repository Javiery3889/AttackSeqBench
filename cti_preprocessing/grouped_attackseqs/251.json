        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report details a campaign by the threat group 'Energetic Bear' involving strategic web compromises for reconnaissance purposes. The group, known for cyber espionage, targeted specific entities such as software suppliers for programmable logic controller (PLC) components used in critical infrastructure. They backdoored these with Havex malware. An example given is the compromise of the Turkish energy company Turcas Petrol's website, turcas.com.tr, which was injected with SMB credential-harvesting malware.",
        "Initial Access": "The CTI report describes an initial access technique used by 'Energetic Bear' where a Turkish energy company's website was compromised through a supply chain attack and used in a watering hole attack targeting individuals associated with Turkish critical infrastructure. The site was injected with SMB credential-harvesting malware to facilitate this access.",
        "Credential Access": "The CTI report indicates that 'Energetic Bear' used SMB credential-harvesting malware as part of their credential access strategy. This was observed in the compromise of the Turkish energy company's website, where an image URL was modified to redirect to a file protocol, allowing the group to harvest Microsoft SMB credentials.",
        "Others": "The CTI report by RiskIQ provides insights into 'Energetic Bear's' broader targeting strategy beyond specific entities. General-purpose websites like plantengineering.com, serving as hubs for critical infrastructure sector information, were also compromised. The attackers had broad access to the server, indicating a definite pattern of targeting news and information websites for the industrial sector. RiskIQ's analysis suggests that the campaign started between the beginning of February and the end of March. The report emphasizes the increasing prevalence of supply-chain attacks and the need for site owners to inventory third-party code on their web assets to prevent becoming pawns in such operations."
