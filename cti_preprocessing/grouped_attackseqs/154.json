        "Reconnaissance": "The Sednit group, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, or STRONTIUM, has been deploying a new component since the end of 2015, a downloader for the main Sednit backdoor, Xagent. This component, referred to as Zebrocy, is a family of malware that includes downloaders and backdoors written in Delphi and AutoIt, serving as first-stage malware. The group targets entities such as embassies, ministries of foreign affairs, and diplomats across various countries. Zebrocy's attack begins with an email message containing malicious attachments, which may be Microsoft Office documents or archives. These documents use methods like Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), exploits, or Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to download the first stage payload. Two specific campaigns were launched at the end of 2017 with documents named 'Syria - New Russia provocations.doc' and 'Note Letter Mary Christmas Card.doc'. Both documents contain a VBA macro that creates a randomly-named file in the %TEMP% directory, decodes the malware executable, and runs it using PowerShell or Scriptable Shell Objects.",
        "Initial Access": "The Sednit group's initial access to victim networks is primarily through email attachments containing malicious documents or archives. These documents execute a VBA macro to download and run the first stage payload. The group uses social engineering to lure victims into opening these attachments, which are disguised with document-like filenames and icons. The Delphi downloader, as the first stage, displays a splash window with a bogus error message to distract the user while it gathers information from the victim's computer and establishes persistence through a Windows registry entry. The AutoIt downloader, which can be either the first or second stage, performs additional reconnaissance functions and also displays a splash window to mislead the victim.",
        "Execution": "The execution of the Sednit group's malware begins with the Delphi downloader, which creates a process using the Windows API CreateProcess function with 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' as the argument. It then sends the gathered information to a C&C server via an HTTP POST request. If the target is deemed interesting, the server responds with the next stage payload, which is written into a file and executed. The AutoIt downloader, when acting as the first stage, executes the payload received from the C&C server. The Delphi backdoor, as the final stage, executes callback functions via the Windows API function SetTimer, allowing the operator to handle various features and commands.",
        "Persistence": "The Sednit group ensures persistence of their malware through the Delphi downloader, which adds a Windows registry entry under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ with the path of a hardcoded filename. The AutoIt downloader uses a similar persistence mechanism.",
        "Defense Evasion": "To evade detection, the Delphi downloader displays a splash window with a bogus error message, and the AutoIt downloader shows a splash screen related to the binary icon, such as a corrupted PDF file or a popup asking for a password. These tactics are meant to distract the victim from the malware's actual activities. Additionally, the Delphi backdoor uses AES encryption to protect its configuration data and communications with the C&C server.",
        "Discovery": "The Sednit group's malware, specifically the AutoIt downloader, performs extensive reconnaissance on victim computers. It detects sandbox and virtual environments, retrieves a list of installed software, determines the Windows version, and gathers process lists, hard drive information, and screenshots. It also uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) objects to collect various information about the victim computer.",
        "Command and Control": "The Delphi backdoor communicates with the C&C server by storing reports of its functions into temporary files, reading the content, and then sending it on. These temporary files are stored in hidden directories created during the setup phase. The backdoor uses the AES-256-ECB algorithm to encrypt the contents before sending them to the C&C server.",
        "Others": "The Sednit group, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, or STRONTIUM, has been active since 2004. Their main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets. The group has been deploying a new component, Zebrocy, since the end of 2015.
