        "Initial Access": "Throughout the multiple campaigns observed over the last 3 years, the actor has used an email attachment as the initial infection vector. They then use additional social engineering to prompt the target to open a .src file, display a decoy document to the users, and finally execute the malware on the victim's machine.",
        "Execution": "The current version of the malware allows the operator to execute arbitrary code on the infected host.",
        "Persistence": "In the 2014 campaign, the malware dropped two files on the targeted system: a decoy document and a fake svchost.exe binary, both stored in \"C:\\Windows\". In the 2016 campaign, the malware was dropped in the local setting of the current user and a shortcut was created to launch winnit.exe in the startup folder. In the 2017 campaigns, persistence was achieved by a Windows shortcut named adobe distillist.lnk.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware has evolved over time, moving from a single file to a dual file structure (an executable and a dynamic library), and the decoy documents have become more advanced. The malware checks if a file used on a previous version of KONNI is available on the system.",
        "Credential Access": "The malware is capable of stealing keystrokes and credentials from browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.",
        "Collection": "The malware is designed to steal files, keystrokes, and perform screenshots.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware communicates with command and control (C2) domains using HTTP connections. The C2 infrastructure was hosted by a free web hosting provider, 000webhost. The malware samples connected to a specific URI: <c2-domain>/login.php. Over time, more .php files became available for registration, uploading, and downloading files.",
        "Exfiltration": "The malware uploads stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure.",
        "Others": "The malware, named KONNI, has been under the radar for over 3 years, authored by Paul Rascagneres from Talos. It has been used in multiple campaigns targeting public organizations, with decoy documents suggesting links to North Korea. The malware's capabilities and infrastructure have evolved, including the use of free web hosting providers for C2 and the addition of remote administration features. The latest campaigns from April 2017 are still active, and the infrastructure remains operational. The malware's evolution shows technical advancements and improved decoy documents containing potentially sensitive data."
