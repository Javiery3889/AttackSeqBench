        "Initial Access": "The group frequently uses publicly available exploits to conduct widespread scanning and exploitation against vulnerable systems, likely in an effort to obtain authentication credentials to allow further access. In recent attacks targeting COVID-19 vaccine research and development, the group conducted basic vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses owned by the organizations. The group then deployed public exploits against the vulnerable services identified. The group has been successful using recently published exploits to gain initial footholds. Examples include CVE-2019-19781 Citrix, CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure, CVE-2018-13379 FortiGate, and CVE-2019-9670 Zimbra. The group also uses spear-phishing to obtain authentication credentials to internet-accessible login pages for target organizations.",
        "Persistence": "Upon gaining access to a system, the group likely drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to the compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access. The actor is likely to use anonymizing services when using the stolen credentials.",
        "Command and Control": "In some cases, APT29 also deploys custom malware known as WellMess or WellMail to conduct further operations on the victim's system. WellMess is malware written in either Golang or .NET and has been in use since at least 2018. It is designed to execute arbitrary shell commands, upload and download files, and supports HTTP, TLS, and DNS communications methods. WellMail is a lightweight tool designed to run commands or scripts with the results being sent to a hardcoded Command and Control (C2) server. It uses hard-coded client and certificate authority TLS certificates to communicate with C2 servers.",
        "Others": "APT29, also known as 'the Dukes' or 'Cozy Bear', is assessed to be part of the Russian intelligence services by the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE), with agreement from the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) and endorsement from the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS CISA). The group targets governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare, and energy targets for intelligence gain. Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property. The group uses custom malware known as 'WellMess' and 'WellMail' to target organizations globally, including those involved with COVID-19 vaccine development. These malware have not previously been publicly associated with APT29. The malware SoreFang, dubbed by the NCSC, is a first stage downloader that uses HTTP to exfiltrate victim information and download second stage malware. It is likely that SoreFang targets SangFor devices. Industry reporting indicates that other actors, including 'DarkHotel', have also targeted SangFor devices. APT29 is likely to continue targeting organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development."
