        "Initial Access": "The CozyDuke toolset includes an infection vector that involves spreading via email, typically containing a link to a compromised website hosting a ZIP file, or in some cases, hosted on Dropbox. The ZIP file contains an executable that, upon execution, writes to disk and executes CozyDuke while presenting the user with a decoy, such as an uninteresting PDF or a Flash video of monkeys.",
        "Execution": "The main component of CozyDuke is a DLL file responsible for orchestrating all of CozyDuke's activity on a victim machine. It is executed by the CozyDuke dropper using a copy of rundll32.exe. The entrypoint function varies but is always specified in the dropper configuration. The main component's functionalities include establishing persistence, gathering basic system information, communicating with the C&C server, and executing additional tasks, modules, or executables as commanded by the C&C server.",
        "Persistence": "CozyDuke establishes persistence by setting itself to be executed at system startup through registry values under various registry keys or by registering itself as a Windows service or scheduled task. It may also utilize COM-object hijacking to ensure it stays active on the victim host.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The main CozyDuke dropper checks for anti-virus products installed on the victim's machine and compares them to a predetermined list. If a match is found, the dropper exits immediately. Newer versions of the dropper also check for execution within a virtual machine or known malware analysis sandbox environment and will exit if these checks fail. The dropper decrypts encrypted data stored as PE resources in the executable, which are used to install CozyDuke components on the victim system.",
        "Command and Control": "CozyDuke communicates with its C&C server using HTTP or HTTPS, with the details specified in its configuration data. It can also use Twitter as a backup C&C channel, with the account details included in the configuration data. Known CozyDuke C&C servers are believed to be compromised servers.",
        "Others": "CozyDuke has been under active development since at least 2011 and is used for targeted attacks against high-profile organizations, including governmental entities. It shares infrastructure with other known threats like MiniDuke and OnionDuke. CozyDuke's evolution shows significant refactoring and additional functionality over time. The toolset includes modules and executables for tasks such as command execution, password stealing, and information collection. CozyDuke uses various user agent strings and mutexes, and a variety of filenames are associated with its activities."
