        "Reconnaissance": "Threat Group-3279 (TG-3279) performs reconnaissance on targets via open source research and network scanning.",
        "Resource Development": "TG-3279 reuses network infrastructure between attacks, sharing IP addresses by multiple domain names. Domain registration information tends to be unique, sometimes using famous names or appearing as jokes, often cloned from legitimate companies like Google or Microsoft.",
        "Initial Access": "TG-3279 uses a port scanning tool named 's' and an RDP brute force tool named 'rdp_crk', which may be used to scan and exploit targets.",
        "Persistence": "TG-3279 leverages optionally loaded DLLs to establish persistence for the Conpee plugin framework, using a method that does not require modifying the Windows Registry or startup items.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "TG-3279 installs tools by compromising the account credentials of users with administrator privileges.",
        "Defense Evasion": "TG-3279's command and control (C2) communication often takes place over port 443 but is not HTTPS traffic. The traffic appears to be part of a larger framework named PATX. The C2 communications include IP calculations and domain name parking to complicate investigations.",
        "Credential Access": "TG-3279 actors strive to access network and system administrators' accounts to gain the most access to the target organization.",
        "Lateral Movement": "After initial exploitation, TG-3279 relies on a few key hosts to act as beachheads running the Conpee or Etso tools. TG-3279 then adds scheduled system tasks to other key resources within an organization to use compromised credentials gathered from pwdump6.",
        "Command and Control": "TG-3279 C2 communication often takes place over port 443 but is not HTTPS traffic. It includes IP calculations and domain name parking to complicate investigations.",
        "Others": "TG-3279 has been active since 2009 and is associated with the China Cracking Group. The personas Laurentiu Moon and Sincoder are believed to be TG-3279 actors. The group's focus is on collecting video game source code to crack games for free use, develop tools to cheat at the games, or use the source code for competing products. TG-3279 has been observed using tools such as Conpee, a modular plugin-based RAT framework, and other tools authored by Sincoder. TG-3279 has also been observed using popular public tools like pwdump6. The group has been observed compromising video game companies and is likely to continue operations for the foreseeable future. There are similarities between TG-3279 and TG-2633, also known as Winnti, but no strong link has been established between the groups."
