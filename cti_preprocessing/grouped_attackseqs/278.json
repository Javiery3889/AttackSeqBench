    "rewrite": {
        "Initial Access": "In the summer of 2020, Group-IB specialists discovered a malware distribution campaign exploiting Telegram's legitimate features to distribute Raccoon stealer. Attackers used Telegram channels to bypass blocking of active C&C servers. The campaign involved phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus phishing kit and mailings with attachments containing malicious macros.",
        "Execution": "The Raccoon stealer, once executed, collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill form details from browsers. It also scans for valid crypto wallets and gains access to configuration files. The Vidar stealer, another malware used in the campaign, collects data from browsers, bank card data, crypto wallet files, messages, and more.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers used obfuscation techniques such as aaencode algorithm to hide the JS-sniffer's code. They also used loaders like Buer and Smoke to download payloads. The Raccoon stealer made network requests to a Telegram channel to receive the encrypted address of a new C&C server, bypassing blocking.",
        "Command and Control": "The Raccoon stealer communicated with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram to avoid detection. The C&C servers were encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'.",
        "Others": "The campaign was divided into four stages based on the tools used: First wave (February 19 to March 5, 2020), Second wave (March 13 to May 22, 2020), Third wave (June 29 to July 2, 2020), and Fourth wave (August 24 to September 12, 2020). Most domains related to the campaign were registered with two registrars: Cloud2m and Host Africa. The attackers also distributed samples of another stealer called Vidar using malicious macros and phishing pages. The domains used to store the code and collect stolen bank card data were registered during the second wave with the same registrars as the domains discovered while investigating the malicious campaign. The attackers experimented with various loaders, including Buer and Smoke loaders. The campaign's purpose was to steal payment and user data."
