        "Initial Access": "The Aurora operation utilized a JavaScript-based exploit vector targeting Internet Explorer 6, as detailed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-002. The exploit involved a heap spray attack and shellcode injection, which then downloaded a secondary payload from a server. The dropper, once executed, would delete itself.",
        "Execution": "The malware's execution process involved a two-stage installation. Initially, the dropper installed the payload as a service, which then deleted the first service and registered a second service pointing to the same backdoor DLL. The payload accessed an encrypted embedded resource to obtain the C&C server DNS name.",
        "Persistence": "The Aurora malware achieved persistence by installing itself as a service under random names and modifying registry keys. The dropper decompressed an embedded DLL into the Windows system32 directory and loaded it as a service, with registry keys created and then deleted as part of the process.",
        "Defense Evasion": "To evade detection, the dropper modified the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL and loaded the DLL into its own svchost.exe process. The dropper also deleted itself using a dissolving batch file.",
        "Command and Control": "The Aurora malware communicated with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme. The C&C protocol involved specific packet formats and encrypted payloads with keys recoverable from the packet header.",
        "Others": "The report provides insights into the origins, developers, and operators of the Aurora malware operation, attributing it to Chinese origins based on forensic tool-marks and domain registration information. It also details detection methods, including JavaScript and shellcode artifacts, network detection signatures, and actionable intelligence for identifying and remediating the malware. Additionally, it discusses the global activity of the exploit and provides information on remediation and prevention strategies using various enterprise products and services."
