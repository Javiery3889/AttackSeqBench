        "Resource Development": "RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines, which are slightly modified versions of publicly available exploits, usually obfuscated. This behavior falls under Obtain Capabilities and Compromise Infrastructure techniques. RIG EK also uses malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to its landing page.",
        "Initial Access": "RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript. This process is non-disruptive and requires limited interaction, aligning with the Drive-by Compromise technique.",
        "Execution": "Upon successful execution on the victim machine, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure, using Command and Scripting Interpreter and Exploitation for Client Execution techniques.",
        "Defense Evasion": "RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature to check if the malware is detected by popular antivirus software.",
        "Command and Control": "RIG EK's infrastructure includes Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), proxy servers, and an API server. The API serves the exploit through the proxy server, which is a reverse proxy to the VDS. The exploit server detects the user's browser and returns the exploit code encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.",
        "Others": "RIG EK has been active since 2014, distributing various types of malware, including Dridex, RaccoonStealer, and SmokeLoader. It targets machines running outdated versions of Internet Explorer. With new exploits added to its arsenal, RIG EK achieved a 30% exploitation rate in 2022. The exploit kit operates as a service model, distributing different types of malware for various threat actors. It has intercepted victim traffic from 207 countries, with the most successful campaigns in Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and the Middle East. The highest exploit try rates and successful infections occurred on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. RIG EK's operators have a close relationship with the developer of Dridex malware."
