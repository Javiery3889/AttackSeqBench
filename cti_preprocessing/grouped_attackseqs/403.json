        "Initial Access": "This recent campaign used malicious documents to install malware on the targeted system using a template injection attack. This technique allows a weaponized document to download an external Word template containing macros that will be executed. This is a known trick used to bypass static malicious document analysis, as well as detection, as the macros are embedded in the downloaded template. The timeline for these documents, that were sent to an unknown number of targets, ran between 31 March and 18 May 2020.",
        "Persistence": "In our analysis we could observe how the adversary ensures persistence by delivering an LNK file into the startup folder. The value of this persistent LNK file is hardcoded inside every sample. Dynamically, and through the Windows APIs NtCreateFile and NtWriteFile, the LNK is written in the startup folder. The LNK file contains the path to execute the DLL file with the required parameters.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Phase Three: Network Evasion Techniques. Attackers are always trying to remain undetected in their intrusions which is why it is common to observe techniques such as mimicking the same User-Agent that is present in the system, in order to remain under the radar. Using the same User-Agent string from the victim's web browser configurations, for example, will help avoid network-based detection systems from flagging outgoing traffic as suspicious. In this case, we observed how, through the use of the Windows API ObtainUserAgentString, the attacker obtained the User-Agent and used the value to connect to the command and control server. If the implant cannot detect the User-Agent in the system, it will use the default Mozilla User-Agent instead.",
        "Others": "Operation North Star, a campaign observed by McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR), targeted the Aerospace & Defense industry with malicious documents containing job postings from leading defense contractors. The campaign, similar to activities in 2017 and 2019, aimed to install data gathering implants for intelligence collection. McAfee ATR identified multiple European countries' compromised infrastructure used for command and control. The campaign, attributed to Hidden Cobra, a group linked to North Korea, also expanded to other sectors, including finance positions at a leading animation studio. The TTPs of the 2020 activity align with those of previous campaigns, with a focus on collecting information from individuals connected to the industries in the job descriptions. McAfee ATR has been tracking this campaign since early April 2020, with the latest activity in mid-June 2020. The campaign's objective is to collect information from individuals connected to the industries in the job descriptions. McAfee detects these threats under various names, including Trojan-FRVP and W97M/Downloader, and has updated signatures to protect against the HTTP: Microsoft Office OLE Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199)."
