        "Reconnaissance": "The London Blue group collected contact information for more than 500 financial executives, including Agari CFO Raymond Lim, using a commercial US-based lead service. This information was gathered as part of the initial preparation for BEC campaigns targeting California-based companies.",
        "Initial Access": "London Blue sent a test email from an attack email account to one of the group's central operational email addresses to verify successful delivery before launching their BEC campaign.",
        "Defense Evasion": "London Blue's BEC attempt against Agari CFO Raymond Lim was blocked by Agari Advanced Threat Protection.",
        "Others": "London Blue has evolved their tactics by targeting new parts of the world, including Asia, and using new tactics in their BEC campaigns. They have also started spoofing email addresses of target company CEOs to add authenticity to their attacks. The group has amassed a new targeting database of nearly 8,500 financial executives from almost 7,800 different companies worldwide. Most companies targeted using spoofing techniques do not have a DMARC record established, and those that do often have policies set to p=none, which does not prevent spoofed emails from reaching their targets."
