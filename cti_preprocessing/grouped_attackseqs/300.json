        "Initial Access": "In December, SolarWinds, an IT managed services provider, was compromised in a sophisticated supply-chain attack. The attackers deployed a custom backdoor, Sunburst, on the networks of over 18,000 customers. This initial access allowed for further exploitation. On March 2, Microsoft reported that HAFNIUM, a new APT actor, exploited four zero-days in Exchange Server for initial access. Volexity also reported the same Exchange zero-days being used in early 2021. A campaign active since mid-March targeted governmental entities in the Russian Federation using these Exchange zero-days. The campaign utilized a previously unknown malware family named FourteenHi. Traces of activity involving variants of this malware date back a year. There were overlaps with HAFNIUM in terms of infrastructure and TTPs, as well as the use of ShadowPad malware.",
        "Command and Control": "In the SolarWinds incident, the Sunburst backdoor communicated with its C2 server and used a protocol to upgrade victims for further exploitation. The backdoor revealed features overlapping with Kazuar, a .NET backdoor linked to the Turla APT group. The shared features included the victim UID generation algorithm, sleep algorithm, and the use of the FNV1a hash to obfuscate string comparisons. Kaspersky telemetry revealed a spike in exploitation attempts for the Exchange vulnerabilities following public disclosure and patch from Microsoft. Approximately 1,400 unique servers were targeted, with one or more vulnerabilities used to obtain initial access and communicate with C2 servers."
