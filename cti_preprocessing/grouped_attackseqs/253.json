        "Initial Access": "The CTI report details the initial compromise and establishment of a foothold using Cobalt Strike's beacon. The beacon, acting as a backdoor, is installed and executed in various forms, either as a stager or stageless. The stager downloads and executes the beacon in memory using protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS, while the stageless method includes the beacon, resulting in a larger payload size. Cobalt Strike's builder can create payloads in multiple formats, including exe, dll, Service exe, hta, vba macro, PowerShell command, and raw formats. The beacon can communicate with the C&C server using protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS, and for internal networks, an SMB beacon is used. Cobalt Strike's 'spawn' feature is used to prevent detection by running beacons in normal processes, and the 'malleable C&C profile' feature allows attackers to modify C&C traffic to bypass network packet-based detection systems.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "After the initial compromise, attackers seek to escalate privileges to obtain administrator credentials for lateral movement. Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz feature is used to steal account information, but requires higher privileges than Administrator to run. Attackers utilize UAC bypass or LPE vulnerabilities, sometimes employing third-party tools, to achieve the necessary privilege escalation.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Cobalt Strike provides various techniques to bypass detection by security products. It can manipulate packets for network communications, making it difficult to detect HTTP and HTTPS beacon communications. The beacon operates as a process, and Cobalt Strike offers settings to prevent detection of suspicious processes. Additionally, it can bypass memory-based detections by altering the form of the beacon in memory.",
        "Discovery": "Attackers use tools like ADFind and port scanning to collect information about the network and connected PCs after gaining escalated privileges. ADFind, a command-line tool, is used to gather Active Directory information, including domain controllers, subnets, computers in the domain, and Active Directory details of the current system.",
        "Lateral Movement": "Attackers use direct shell commands or Cobalt Strike's default commands like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh for lateral movement. These tools are used to propagate beacons to other systems within the company's network.",
        "Others": "The report discusses various cases where Cobalt Strike was used in different stages of cyber attacks, including distribution, installation, and lateral movement. It also covers ransomware cases exploiting Cobalt Strike, such as BlueCrab, Hancitor, and cases involving companies A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The report highlights the use of Cobalt Strike in ransomware attacks targeting Korean companies and examines ransomware cases like CLOP, Conti, DarkSide, and Ryuk, detailing how attackers used Cobalt Strike to compromise internal infrastructures and deploy ransomware. The report concludes with recommendations for security managers to protect against Cobalt Strike attacks, emphasizing the importance of monitoring Administrator accounts, disabling unnecessary ports, and keeping software and security products updated."
