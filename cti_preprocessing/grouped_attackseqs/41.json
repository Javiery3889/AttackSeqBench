        "Initial Access": "RevengeHotels is a cybercrime campaign targeting the hospitality sector, including hotels and tourism companies, primarily in Brazil but also worldwide. The main attack vector is spear-phishing emails with malicious Word, Excel, or PDF attachments, some exploiting CVE-2017-0199. The emails contain well-crafted social engineering content, often impersonating legitimate companies using typo-squatting domains. The attached documents use template injection to execute macro code, which in turn downloads and executes malware such as RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, and ProCC.",
        "Execution": "The malware downloaded in the RevengeHotels campaign are .NET binaries protected with Yoda Obfuscator, which unpack to reveal commercial RATs like RevengeRAT. An additional module called ScreenBooking captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com. In the ProCC campaigns, the malware are Delphi binaries with a customized backdoor capable of collecting data from the clipboard and printer spooler, as well as capturing screenshots.",
        "Credential Access": "The attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies. They also sell credentials from compromised systems, providing remote access to hotel front desks infected by the campaign. This allows other cybercriminals to steal credit card details from hotel administration software.",
        "Collection": "The malware used in these campaigns is designed to collect credit card data by monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer, as hotel personnel often handle credit card information from OTA websites.",
        "Others": "The RevengeHotels campaign has been active since at least 2015, with confirmed victims in multiple countries. The campaign uses traditional RAT malware to infect businesses in the hospitality sector. Kaspersky products detect this threat under various names, and indicators of compromise (IoCs) are available on the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal."
