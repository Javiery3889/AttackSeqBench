        "Reconnaissance": "Unit 42 has identified an attack campaign targeting Indian government and military personnel, overlapping with Operation Transparent Tribe and Operation C-Major. The campaign, known as 'ProjectM,' has been linked to an individual from Pakistan through open source research. The actors used spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites, including a blog titled 'India News Tribe,' to deliver various tools such as Trojans Crimson and Peppy, as well as RATs like DarkComet and Bozok. Techniques observed include the exploitation of CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158, and the use of malicious macros in Excel files.",
        "Resource Development": "The ProjectM actors have developed a significant toolset for their campaigns, including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs. They have also utilized the Andromeda Trojan as an initial payload to download and execute other tools. Infrastructure used by ProjectM was often registered using WHOIS protection services, but two domains, 'winupdater[.]info' and 'ordering-checks[.]com,' were registered without protection, revealing the email address 'mshoaib.yaseen [at] gmail.com'. This email is linked to various social media accounts and suggests the individual's involvement in web design services and revenue generation through Google AdSense.",
        "Initial Access": "ProjectM actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files exploiting known vulnerabilities.",
        "Execution": "The ProjectM campaign executed malicious code through the use of Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, as well as RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok. Techniques included the exploitation of vulnerabilities and the use of malicious macros.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The ProjectM campaign utilized WHOIS protection services to conceal their infrastructure, but lapses in this practice revealed connections to an individual potentially involved in the campaign. The use of various Trojans and RATs also suggests techniques for defense evasion.",
        "Command and Control": "The ProjectM campaign's command and control infrastructure included domains registered with WHOIS protection, but two domains were linked to an individual's email address. These domains were used to host C2 servers for the Andromeda Trojan, which delivered further payloads.",
        "Others": "The individual linked to ProjectM's infrastructure appears to have skills in offensive cyber operations, as suggested by social media posts and blog content related to network scanning, Metasploit, and post-exploitation activities. The actor's name was found in the debug symbol path of Crimson tools, indicating possible involvement in malware development. The actor's anti-Indian sentiment, as expressed on social media, suggests a potential political motivation behind the attacks. Trend Micro discovered gigabytes of personal identifiable information (PII) on C2 servers related to ProjectM, indicating the collection of sensitive data from Indian Army personnel."
