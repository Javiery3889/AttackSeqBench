    "file_name": "THOR_ Previously Unseen PlugX Variant Deployed During Microsoft Exchange Server Attacks by PKPLUG Group",
    "tactic_label": true,
    "rewrite": {
        "Initial Access": "On March 19, 2021, attackers exploited an Exchange Server via ProxyLogon zero-days (CVE-2021-26855 and CVE-2021-27065) from IP 101.36.120[.]227. A webshell was uploaded for code execution at high privilege.",
        "Execution": "The attackers used 'living off the land' techniques, employing bitsadmin.exe to download Aro.dat from GitHub to the target. Aro.dat, an encrypted PlugX payload, unpacks via x86 assembly instructions starting at file offset 0x4EC.",
        "Persistence": "Aro.dat, once loaded, unpacks and initiates C2 communication. It creates a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image' for persistence.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Aro.dat uses DLL side-loading for evasion. It also contains a change in its core source code, replacing 'PLUG' with 'THOR' to likely evade AV signatures.",
        "Command and Control": "The PlugX variant communicates with C2 domains like rainydaysweb[.]com using ports 80, 443, 53, and 8000 over TCP and UDP. It uses HTTP for data transmission and outputs to debug if a debugger is attached.",
        "Others": "The PlugX variant, delivered as a RAT, was identified by Unit 42 researchers during the Microsoft Exchange Server attacks in March 2021. The variant, named THOR, was first seen in August 2019 and includes new features like enhanced payload-delivery mechanisms. It is associated with the Chinese cyberespionage group PKPLUG (aka Mustang Panda). Unit 42 developed a tool for payload decryption. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from PlugX with Cortex XDR, the Next-Generation Firewall with WildFire, and Threat Prevention security subscriptions. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are provided to identify the PlugX variant in networks."
