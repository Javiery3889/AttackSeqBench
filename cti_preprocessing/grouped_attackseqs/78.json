        "Initial Access": "We found APT group Iron Tiger's malware compromising chat application Mimi's servers in a supply chain attack. The chat application named MiMi, designed for Chinese users, was compromised to download and install HyperBro samples for the Windows platform and rshell samples for the Mac OS platform. The attackers had direct access to the installers' host server, allowing them to quickly insert a backdoor. The first compromised version was 2.3.0, built on May 26, 2022, indicating that Iron Tiger had access to the Mimi chat developer's backend between May 6 and May 26, 2022. Older installers aimed at Windows OS, versions 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 built on November 23, 2021, also had malicious additions.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers modified the electron-main.js file in the MiMi chat application installers with malicious JavaScript code using Dean Edwards packer. The code downloads the rshell executable from the IP address 139[.]180[.]216[.]65 and executes it on the macOS platform. The rshell malware is a new family targeting Mac OS and Linux platforms. The malicious versions of the chat installer were unsigned, requiring users to bypass macOS security warnings to install the application.",
        "Command and Control": "The rshell executable is a standard backdoor that collects OS information and sends it to the command and control (C&C) server, receives commands from the C&C to execute, and sends command execution results back to the C&C. The backdoor sends information over TCP to the C&C in clear (unencrypted) form. The client also regularly sends a 'keepalive' packet to the C&C.",
        "Others": "The HyperBro malware family has been used by Iron Tiger since 2017 and was updated in mid-2019. The version used in this campaign is similar to previous versions. The targets of the campaign were primarily in Taiwan and the Philippines, with 13 different targets identified. The campaign is attributed to Iron Tiger due to the characteristics of the dlpprem32.dll file linked to HyperBro and the use of specific IP addresses as C&C that have been previously associated with the group. There are also links to Earth Berberoka, suggesting possible connections or subgroups between the threat actors."
