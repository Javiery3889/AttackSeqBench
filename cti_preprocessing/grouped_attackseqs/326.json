        "Initial Access": "On February 2, 2018, FireEye reported that APT37 (Reaper), a suspected North Korean cyber espionage group, utilized social engineering tactics specifically tailored to desired targets, strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, and the distribution of malware via torrent file-sharing sites to achieve initial access.",
        "Defense Evasion": "APT37 has demonstrated sophistication in avoiding detection by using compromised servers, messaging platforms, and cloud service providers for command and control infrastructure. They have improved their operational security over time.",
        "Command and Control": "APT37 uses compromised servers, messaging platforms, and cloud service providers to communicate with compromised systems and control them, showing increased sophistication by improving their operational security over time.",
        "Impact": "APT37 has access to a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration, including custom malware used for espionage purposes and destructive malware.",
        "Others": "APT37's operations are expanding in scope and sophistication, with a toolset that includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware. FireEye assesses with high confidence that APT37's activities are carried out on behalf of the North Korean government, based on malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. The group targets primarily South Korea, as well as Japan, Vietnam, and the Middle East, across various industry verticals such as chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and healthcare. APT37 has exploited vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) and Adobe Flash, demonstrating access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and the ability to incorporate them into operations."
