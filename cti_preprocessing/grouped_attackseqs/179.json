        "Initial Access": "The CTI report details an APT campaign targeting individuals with malware delivered via a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'. Upon execution, the HTA file drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word DOC file while simultaneously executing a backdoor in the background. The malware installer utilizes embedded VB Script to extract and execute the payload, employing techniques to minimize visibility and avoid detection.",
        "Execution": "The malware executes by deleting the original file and rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension. This self-copied file is polymorphic, with each execution resulting in a different MD5 hash. The malware then creates a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware employs evasion techniques such as minimizing the script window and avoiding the display of the window taskbar. It also uses obfuscation to hide the writing of binary codes as HEX to form files, and it checks for the existence of files before deletion to ensure persistence.",
        "Others": "The CTI report indicates that the malware campaign is suspected to be backed by a group with a significant budget, aiming to spy on specific individuals opposed to a country's political methods. The malware is designed to appear as a common threat but employs sophisticated techniques for spying. The analysis of the malware revealed that it is part of an APT attack with potential political motivations, and the campaign has been active since at least 2009. The report also mentions that the domains used by the malware for command and control have a history of phishing and malware distribution. The investigation into the malware and its associated network is ongoing, with an open call for further information related to the threat."
