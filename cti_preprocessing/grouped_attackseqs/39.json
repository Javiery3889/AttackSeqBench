        "Reconnaissance": "The BRONZE PRESIDENT cyberespionage group, likely based in the People's Republic of China (PRC), has been observed targeting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and political and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia since mid-2018. The group uses phishing lures related to national security, humanitarian, and law enforcement topics to gather information.",
        "Resource Development": "BRONZE PRESIDENT has developed its own remote access tools and also utilizes publicly available tools. The group's infrastructure is linked to entities within the PRC and PRC-based Internet service providers. Tools such as PlugX, historically leveraged by PRC-based groups, are part of their arsenal.",
        "Initial Access": "BRONZE PRESIDENT likely uses phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files as an initial access vector. The group has been observed gaining administrator access to all systems within a targeted business unit and installing remote access tools on a significant number of hosts.",
        "Execution": "The group employs a variety of tools for execution, including Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. Cobalt Strike is installed on over 70% of accessible hosts in some intrusions, and RCSession is installed via DLL side-loading.",
        "Persistence": "BRONZE PRESIDENT uses WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on compromised hosts. The group creates and maintains tasks like the Sysdriver scheduled task to periodically execute payloads.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "After compromising a network, BRONZE PRESIDENT elevates privileges and installs malware on a large proportion of systems. The group uses native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files containing password hashes.",
        "Defense Evasion": "BRONZE PRESIDENT takes steps to minimize detection, such as deleting volume shadow copies after use and killing processes post-execution. The group installs malware on many hosts but exercises restraint to avoid detection.",
        "Credential Access": "The group collects credentials from high-privilege network accounts and reputationally sensitive accounts, such as social media and webmail accounts. They also extract password hashes from NTDS.dit files for offline exploitation.",
        "Discovery": "BRONZE PRESIDENT uses tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands to understand network environments and identify opportunities for lateral movement.",
        "Lateral Movement": "The group leverages Wmiexec extensively to move laterally and execute WMI commands on remote hosts. They also use net commands to connect to other hosts using compromised credentials.",
        "Collection": "BRONZE PRESIDENT targets specific data types and uses custom batch scripts to collate identified files into archives. They use scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations.",
        "Command and Control": "The group's C2 techniques vary based on the remote access tools used. RCSession communicates with a hard-coded C2 server using a custom protocol, while ORat uses a raw socket protocol. Cobalt Strike uses malleable C2 profiles and connects to multiple C2 domains.",
        "Exfiltration": "BRONZE PRESIDENT uses tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate archived data. They target specific data types and use custom batch scripts to create lists of files with predefined criteria for exfiltration.",
        "Others": "Secureworks Counter Threat Unit researchers have been monitoring BRONZE PRESIDENT activity since mid-2018, with artifacts suggesting network intrusions dating back to 2014. The group's long-term objective appears to be monitoring target networks. BRONZE PRESIDENT's systemic long-term targeting does not align with patriotic or criminal threat groups, suggesting government sponsorship or tolerance."
