        "Initial Access": "Volon's Research team observed a spear phishing attack on Officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in early August. The email lured officials by asking them to download an MS Excel sheet named 'amended training schedule of IFS officers'. The download link provided in the email appeared to be from 'https://www.mea.gov.in/ifs-training.schedule', but it actually pointed to a malicious XLS document from the URL 'http://info-sharing.net/?a=1533541533'.",
        "Execution": "The malicious document contained macro code which executed to drop the first payload, a Crimson RAT downloader. This payload then downloaded a fully functional Crimson RAT from the IP address 151.106.19[.]207:8246.",
        "Persistence": "The first payload downloaded the fully functional Crimson RAT and dropped it to the path 'C:\\ProgramData\\Hurmz\\bahgrtmrs.exe'.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The payload had the capability to kill any process running in the system using specific code.",
        "Credential Access": "The Crimson RAT had functionalities for keylogging and browser credential theft.",
        "Command and Control": "The payload received commands from the C&C server and supported various commands such as listing running processes, listing antiviruses, sending file info, downloading files, updating the binary, and sending disk drives list. It also had the capability to send files to the C&C server.",
        "Others": "A document with similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) was identified in early August with the name 'MoFA-MoDAfghanistan.xls', uploaded on 3rd August 2018. The XLS file contained malicious macro code, which upon execution, downloaded a payload from the URL 'http://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll'. In 2016, Proofpoint published a report on 'Operation Transparent Tribe', detailing various attacks against Indian Embassies using Crimson RAT. One of the campaigns fetched a payload from the same URL as found in the second campaign 'http://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll'. This suggests that the APT group behind Operation Transparent Tribe is active and targeting Indian officials again. The conclusion is that there is a high probability that the APT group behind 'Operation Transparent Tribe' might be active and is targeting Indian organizations again. Indicators of Compromise include various hashes and IP addresses: 58d52690179c2467fce76cec126ec5bb915f32d66955de954bd89e3110d6a03e0f0f6f48c3ee5f8e7cd3697c40002bc76b4635023eb1372df9b7618a5dae6128, 151.106.19.207:8246, 151.106.19.207:3286, 151.106.19.207:12621, and 'http://info-sharing.net/?a=1533541533'."
