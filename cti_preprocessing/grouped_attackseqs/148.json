        "Initial Access": "The CTI report details an attack campaign targeting Russia and Russian-speaking nations, known as 'Roaming Tiger'. The adversaries used weaponized exploit documents to gain initial access, exploiting the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2012-0158. A spear-phishing email was sent from an impersonated individual of the Russian-based organization Vigstar, containing a malicious document that, once opened, would infect the system and leave a Russian language decoy document.",
        "Execution": "The CTI report describes the execution process of the BBSRAT malware. Upon initial execution, the dropper generates a path in the %TEMP% directory and writes an embedded cab file. It then creates directories based on the Windows version and uses the expand.exe utility to write three files to the SSONSVR directory: aclmain.sdb, pnipcn.dll, and ssonsvr.exe. The legitimate Citrix executable ssonsvr.exe is used to sideload the malicious pnipcn.dll file, which then identifies the path to msiexec.exe, spawns a suspended instance of it, and performs process hollowing before resuming the process. To ensure persistence, a registry key is written to run ssonsvr.exe on startup.",
        "Persistence": "The BBSRAT malware ensures persistence by writing a registry key on the victim's machine to run the ssonsvr.exe file on startup. Additionally, the malware uses a downloader that deploys a DLL to either %SYSTEMROOT%\\web\\srvcl32.dll or %APPDATA%\\web\\srvcl32.dll, with corresponding registry keys set to ensure the DLL loads when Windows starts. This technique was previously used by the ZeroAccess rootkit.",
        "Command and Control": "The CTI report identifies the command and control (C2) infrastructure used by the BBSRAT malware. Analysis shows that the new samples used the same C2 domains as the 'Roaming Tiger' campaign, including transactiona[.]com and futuresgold[.]com. The C2 domains have significant overlap among the hashes and IPs, but the BBSRAT C2s contain no overlap, suggesting purpose-built variants and infrastructure for each target. BBSRAT communicates with the C2 server using HTTP or HTTPS requests and exfiltrates data about the victim's machine via POST requests.",
        "Exfiltration": "The BBSRAT malware exfiltrates data about the victim's machine to the C2 server using POST requests with a custom binary structure. The data is compressed using ZLIB and, if sent via HTTP, an additional encryption algorithm is applied.",
        "Others": "The CTI report mentions that despite public knowledge of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the adversaries continue to reuse much of their exposed playbook. Organizations are urged to use threat intelligence data proactively to secure themselves and prevent attacks. The report also includes a YARA rule for detecting BBSRAT and a list of identified BBSRAT samples with their associated C2 servers."
