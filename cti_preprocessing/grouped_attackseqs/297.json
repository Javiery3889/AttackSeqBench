        "Reconnaissance": "Since January 2023, Microsoft has observed Russian cyber threat activity adjusting to boost destructive and intelligence gathering capacity on Ukraine and its partners' civilian and military assets. IRIDIUM, a threat actor attributed to Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), appears to be preparing for a renewed destructive campaign. Microsoft investigations have revealed that cyber threat actors with known or suspected ties to the GRU, Russian Foreign Intelligence (SVR), and Russian Federal Security (FSB) services have attempted to gain initial access to government and defense-related organizations in Central and Eastern Europe and the Americas. Between January and mid-February 2023, Microsoft threat intelligence analysts have found indications of Russian threat activity against organizations in at least 17 European nations, with the government sector the most targeted.",

        "Others": "Russian destructive cyberattacks have fluctuated in intensity and been frequently repelled. Most Kremlin-backed propaganda campaigns aimed at Ukraine have had little impact. Russian state-affiliated cyber and influence actors continue to seek alternative strategies inside and outside Ukraine. IRIDIUM has been preparing for a renewed destructive campaign, like its wave of Foxblade and Caddywiper malware deployments against Ukrainian government and media organizations in the early days of the war. As of late 2022, the threat actor may also have been testing additional ransomware-style capabilities that could be used in destructive attacks on organizations outside Ukraine that serve key functions in Ukraine's supply lines. The Prestige ransomware operation against a Polish firm in late 2022 provides a precedent for such attacks."
