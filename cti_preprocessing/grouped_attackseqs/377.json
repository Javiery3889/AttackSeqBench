        "Initial Access": "Grabit malware is delivered via a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) email attachment containing a malicious macro named AutoOpen. This macro opens a TCP socket and sends an HTTP request to a compromised remote server used as a malware hub to download the malware. Some macros were password protected, but the .doc file's archive nature allowed clear-text visibility of macro strings when opened in an editor.",
        "Persistence": "Grabit malware modifies common registry entries, such as startup configurations, without covering its tracks. The binaries are not deleted in most cases, and its communication is in clear-text.",
        "Credential Access": "Grabit includes a Keylogger functionality that prepares files acting as containers for keyboard interrupts, collecting hostnames, application names, usernames, and passwords. The file names contain strings such as 'HawkEye_Keylogger_Execution_Confirmed_<VICTIM>'.",
        "Command and Control": "Grabit's 'call home' functionality communicates over obvious channels without attempting to hide its activity.",
        "Others": "Kaspersky researchers investigated the Grabit malware after clients in the United States reported infections. The campaign began in late February 2015 and ended in mid-March, spreading from India, the United States, and Israel globally. The malware, written in Windows machine 32-bit processor code over the Microsoft .NET Framework, varied in size and activity but shared similar internal names and identifiers. The compilation timeline from March 7th to 9th, 2015, showed a range of sample sizes and obfuscation levels, with some samples indicating testing of features and packers. The malware employed serious encryption and ASLR, suggesting the use of an open source RAT or commercial framework. Dynamic analysis revealed that the malware did not employ sophisticated evasion techniques. Approximately 10,000 stolen files were collected, with companies in Thailand and India most affected. The malware used various RATs, including DarkComet, and communicated encrypted data over HTTP random ports. Some samples shared the same hosting server and credentials, hinting at a group rather than an individual threat actor. Malware derivatives were mainly located in the 'C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft' directory, with phishing extensions (.doc) and various icons (.pdf, .doc, .ttf, .xls, .ppt, .msg, .exe). The stealer targeted files with extensions like .txt and .jpeg, and additional executable names included 'AudioEndpointBuilder.exe', 'BrokerInfrastructure.exe', and 'WindowsUpdate.exe'. Malware extensions were .zip or .exe, and multiple SHA-1 hashes and IP addresses were associated with the malware."
