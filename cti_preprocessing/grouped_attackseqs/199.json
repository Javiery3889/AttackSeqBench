        "Execution": "The Derusbi server variant, a type of Remote Access Trojan (RAT), is executed as a service dependent on svchost. It begins its startup sequence by determining the host binary name and its own DLL name, then spawns a new thread containing the main server code. This allows the DllEntryPoint routine to return to the calling function. The server variant checks for sufficient access rights, requiring NT Authority to operate. If the check fails, the server variant terminates. After a 5-second sleep, it verifies the fShutdown flag is not set, which could be triggered by the process loading the server variant calling the DllRegisterServer export. The mainLoop function is then called, which handles the loading of the unique infection ID from the registry or configuration from an encoded buffer, and then saves the newly generated infection ID to the registry.",
        "Persistence": "The Derusbi server variant ensures its persistence by installing itself as a service on the victim's machine. This is achieved through the DllRegisterServer function, which is given time to activate and perform necessary operations during the server variant's startup sequence.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "The Derusbi server variant attempts to obtain privileges for SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeShutdownPrivilege, and SeTcbPrivilege, which are necessary for loading the driver component of the malware. If the 360 antivirus product is detected on the victim's machine, the driver is not installed, but the mainLoop continues regardless. If the antivirus is not found, the mainLoop extracts, decodes, and installs the driver binary from an encoded buffer within itself.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Derusbi server variant employs a device driver to hook into the Windows firewall, using undocumented techniques for Windows XP and older or the Windows Filtering Platform for Vista and later. The driver inspects incoming network packets and redirects communication sessions to the server variant if a specific handshake is detected. This allows the attacker to hide their communication within legitimate network sessions, evading detection.",
        "Command and Control": "The Derusbi server variant establishes command and control by selecting a random port between 40,000 and 45,000 to listen for incoming connections. It instructs the driver to redirect appropriate TCP sessions to this port. The communication between the server variant and the controlling client is encrypted and consists of a sequence of encrypted datagrams with a 24-byte header followed by an optional payload section. The server variant sends information about the victim's computer to the client using a VictimInfoPacket.",
        "Others": "The Derusbi server variant's communication and command dispatch involve selecting a random port for listening, establishing a valid handshake for communication, and sending victim information to the client. The handshake is well-defined, consisting of a 64-byte random buffer with specific DWORD patterns. If the handshake fails, a secondary authentication method using a POST request is available. The server variant has a modular design, supporting up to 8 different modules per sample, including remote command shell, network tunneling, and file management. The malware waits for input from the network and routes packets to the appropriate handler. Detection of the Derusbi server variant can be challenging due to the encrypted nature of its network traffic, but heuristic approaches and YARA signatures can be used for detection."
