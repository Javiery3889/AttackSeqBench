        "Reconnaissance": "The OceanLotus Group, also known as APT-C-00, SeaLotus, and APT32, initiated Operation Cobalt Kitty by targeting a global corporation based in Asia. They focused on the company's top-level management, including vice presidents, senior directors, and key personnel in operational departments. The attackers used spear-phishing attacks to gather information and compromise over 40 PCs and servers, including critical infrastructure such as the domain controller, file servers, web application server, and database server.",
        "Resource Development": "The OceanLotus Group developed a sophisticated arsenal for Operation Cobalt Kitty, which included modified publicly-available tools and six undocumented custom-built tools. These tools were designed to evade traditional security products and included two backdoors exploiting DLL sideloading in applications from Microsoft, Google, and Kaspersky, as well as a novel backdoor targeting Microsoft Outlook for command-and-control and data exfiltration.",
        "Initial Access": "The initial penetration vector for Operation Cobalt Kitty was social engineering through spear-phishing emails containing links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with malicious macros. These macros created persistence on the compromised machines using two scheduled tasks designed to download secondary payloads, mainly Cobalt Strike Beacon.",
        "Execution": "During the first phase of Operation Cobalt Kitty, the OceanLotus Group operated a fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure using customized payloads from offensive frameworks like Cobalt Strike, PowerSploit, and Nishang. The attackers executed PowerShell scripts with embedded base64-encoded payloads to load additional scripts or fetch payloads from the command-and-control server.",
        "Persistence": "The OceanLotus Group established persistence on the network by using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks. They executed loader scripts at startup or at predetermined intervals, ensuring the continuous operation of their fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "The OceanLotus Group used the Mimikatz credential dumping tool to obtain credentials, including user passwords, NTLM hashes, and Kerberos tickets. They customized and obfuscated over 10 different Mimikatz payloads to evade antivirus detection and used the stolen credentials to perform lateral movement and infect more machines.",
        "Defense Evasion": "To maintain stealth and avoid detection, the OceanLotus Group exploited DLL hijacking vulnerabilities in trusted applications, bypassing application whitelisting and security software. They also implemented DNS Tunneling as a command-and-control communication method to overcome network filtering solutions, configuring the backdoor to communicate with Google and OpenDNS servers.",
        "Credential Access": "The OceanLotus Group harvested credentials stored on compromised machines using the Mimikatz tool. They customized and obfuscated Mimikatz payloads to evade detection and used the stolen credentials to infect additional machines and leverage Windows built-in tools for lateral movement.",
        "Discovery": "The OceanLotus Group performed lateral movement and infected new machines during the third phase of Operation Cobalt Kitty. They harvested credentials from compromised machines to facilitate this process.",
        "Lateral Movement": "Using stolen credentials, the OceanLotus Group expanded their control within the network by infecting new machines and leveraging Windows built-in tools, pass-the-ticket, and pass-the-hash attacks.",
        "Command and Control": "The OceanLotus Group used HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control communication, and a novel backdoor that utilized Microsoft Outlook for command execution and data exfiltration.",
        "Exfiltration": "The OceanLotus Group exfiltrated data using a backdoor macro installed in Microsoft Outlook, which enabled them to execute commands, deploy tools, and steal valuable data from compromised machines.",
        "Others": "Operation Cobalt Kitty was a major cyber espionage APT carried out by the OceanLotus Group against a global corporation in Asia. The attackers continuously adapted their techniques and upgraded their arsenal to remain undetected. Cybereason was able to monitor and detect the entire attack lifecycle, from infiltration to exfiltration. The attackers' tools were not detected by traditional antivirus software, highlighting the sophistication of their methods and the importance of understanding behavioral patterns to combat APTs."
