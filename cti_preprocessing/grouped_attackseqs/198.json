        "Reconnaissance": "Mandiant Threat Intelligence has identified that UNC1151, a group assessed with high confidence to be linked to the Belarusian government, has been actively involved in reconnaissance activities. Since at least 2016, UNC1151 has registered credential theft domains that spoof legitimate websites to steal victim credentials. The group has targeted a wide range of entities, focusing on Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Germany, as well as Belarusian dissidents, media entities, and journalists. The specific scope of targeting aligns with Belarusian interests, as the group has sought confidential information without any observed monetization efforts. UNC1151's reconnaissance has included regional webmail providers, national and local governments, and private businesses, with malware-based intrusions also focusing on Eastern Europe. Notably, UNC1151 has not targeted Russian or Belarusian state entities.",
        "Initial Access": "UNC1151 has demonstrated initial access capabilities through spear phishing campaigns. The group has not only targeted entities in countries neighboring Belarus but also those with no obvious connection to Belarusian interests, indicating a possible support for additional priorities. These operations mainly occurred between 2016 and 2019. UNC1151's phishing efforts have included sending malicious attachments to recipients in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, and even governments such as Colombia, Ireland, and Switzerland. Additionally, credential theft emails have been sent to the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
        "Credential Access": "UNC1151 has been actively involved in credential access through the registration of credential theft domains that mimic legitimate websites. The group's phishing campaigns have been designed to steal victim credentials, with a focus on entities in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Germany, as well as Belarusian dissidents and journalists. UNC1151's credential access activities have included targeting regional webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses. The group has not targeted Russian or Belarusian state entities, suggesting a specific focus on Belarusian government interests.",
        "Others": "Mandiant Threat Intelligence has high confidence that UNC1151 is linked to the Belarusian government and provides technical support to the Ghostwriter information operations campaign. The geopolitical indicators and observed narratives consistent with Belarusian government interests suggest moderate confidence that Belarus is at least partially responsible for Ghostwriter. While Russian contributions to UNC1151 or Ghostwriter cannot be ruled out, no direct evidence has been uncovered. UNC1151's operations have shown a consistent evolution of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) since 2017, indicating the maturation of a single organization. Ghostwriter operations have shifted focus since mid-2020 to align more distinctly with Belarusian interests, particularly following the disputed 2020 Belarusian elections. The narratives promoted by Ghostwriter have been featured on Belarusian state television and are relevant to the internal political conversation in Belarus. The sources of content for Ghostwriter operations and the malware used by UNC1151 remain uncertain, suggesting the possibility of involvement from additional organizations or countries. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that Ghostwriter information operations are conducted in support of the Belarusian government and with moderate confidence that they are conducted with Belarusian sponsorship. The lack of direct evidence prevents confirmation of Russian government involvement in UNC1151 and Ghostwriter operations, despite some TTP overlaps and consistency with Russian goals."
