        "Execution": "The CTI report indicates the use of a multi-stage attack involving a shellcode that initiates a process to load a DLL (LdrLoadDll). The shellcode is designed to execute a payload encrypted with a randomly generated key (Key2Encrypt DataPayload). The payload, once decrypted, leverages the aes128 encryption algorithm and a pre-configured password. The attack also involves the use of a checksum verification method (sha256 checksum) to ensure the integrity of the payload before execution.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The report details an evasion technique where the malware's main function (DllMain) is hooked to evade detection. Additionally, the shellcode is encrypted using the aes128 algorithm and a sha256 hashing function to obfuscate its presence."
