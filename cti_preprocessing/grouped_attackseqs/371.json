    "tactic_label": true,
    "rewrite": {
        "Execution": "Industroyer2, a malware targeting Ukraine's electrical infrastructure, was compiled on March 23, 2022, and deployed alongside wipers and a loader. The wipers, including CaddyWiper, SoloShred, and AwfulShred, targeted Windows and Linux systems, while the Linux worm OrcShred and the loader ArguePatch were also part of the attack. Industroyer2 uses the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol to send commands to electrical stations and substations, disrupting their operations.",
        "Impact": "Industroyer2 represents a significant escalation in cyberattacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure, aiming to cause severe damage and disrupt essential services. The malware's deployment indicates a shift from information theft to destructive attacks that can immediately impact a country's basic functions.",
        "Others": "The Sandworm group, likely behind Industroyer2, has been previously linked to attacks on Ukraine's electrical grid in 2015 and 2016. The U.S. Department of Justice has indicted the Russian GRU for using BlackEnergy and Industroyer to destabilize Ukraine. The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team has authored a YARA rule to detect Industroyer2, and the BlackBerry Incident Response team is available to assist with containment and response to such threats."
