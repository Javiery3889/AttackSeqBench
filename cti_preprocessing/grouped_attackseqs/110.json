        "Initial Access": "APT Sidewinder exploited CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net. The HTA file, avoiding PowerShell to remain undetected, checked for installed antivirus software using WMI and communicated with the C2 server.",
        "Execution": "The HTA file contained within the RTF document executed a script that stopped if certain antivirus software was detected. If not detected, it proceeded to run a backdoor named FinalBot.exe, which was extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe in the directory. The backdoor was developed in VB and utilized a modified msvbvm60.dll, renamed to 8EBECD7C.dll.",
        "Persistence": "The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\WinSrv.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Sidewinder's HTA file avoided using PowerShell, which is commonly monitored, and instead used VBS. The backdoor also employed a technique called DLL sideloading, using cmpbk32.dll to execute Srvstr.exe.",
        "Discovery": "The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system.",
        "Command and Control": "The HTA file communicated with the C2 server to send information about the installed antivirus software. The domain used for C2 communication was webserv-redir.net.",
        "Others": "Indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the Sidewinder campaign include various hashes for files such as Test.Zip, FinalBot.exe, hj1.txt, hj.txt, and the domain webserv-redir.net with its associated IP address 185.106.120.43. Additional related domains include heartissuehigh.win, mail.webserv-redir.net, and www.webserv-redir.net. An RTF document was also identified as an IOC with the URL hxxp://www.webserv-redir.net/images/67381F0B/-1/5272/3cdc4fcb/main.RTF."
