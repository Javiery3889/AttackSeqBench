        "Initial Access": "In late January 2021, a phishing email targeting Tibetan organizations was detected, impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association' and originating from a known TA413 Gmail account. The email contained a malicious URL (hxxps://you-tube[.]tv) leading to a fake 'Adobe Flash Player Update' themed landing page, which executed JavaScript files to profile the user's system and determine the delivery of the 'FriarFox' malicious Firefox browser extension.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The FriarFox browser extension, once installed, allows threat actors to gain access to the user's Gmail account and Firefox browser data. It also contacts a command and control server to retrieve the PHP and JS-based payload Scanbox. The extension is designed to search, archive, read, label, mark as spam, delete, refresh, forward emails, and perform function searches in Gmail, as well as access user data for all websites, display notifications, and modify privacy settings in Firefox.",
        "Command and Control": "After installing the FriarFox extension, the threat actors gain control over the user's Gmail account and Firefox browser. The extension contacts a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload, which is capable of tracking visitors, performing keylogging, and collecting user data.",
        "Others": "The FriarFox browser extension is based on the open-source tool 'Gmail Notifier (restartless)' and has been altered by TA413 to include malicious functionality and conceal its presence. TA413 has also used the Scanbox framework since at least June 2020 and has been linked to watering hole attacks targeting Tibetan organizations in 2019. The campaign leverages the legitimate domain Tibet[.]net as a decoy and delivers Scanbox via the malicious browser extension. TA413's campaigns have also used COVID-19 and self-immolation themed lures to deliver Sepulcher malware via malicious RTF files. Despite public disclosures, TA413 has not made significant operational changes and is expected to continue targeting the Tibetan Diaspora."
