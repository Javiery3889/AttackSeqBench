        "Initial Access": "The Rocket Kitten Group employs spear phishing and social engineering as their primary point of entry. They establish contact with victims by faking accounts and identities, using fake Google Drive or Gmail accounts, stolen documents, and social media accounts like Facebook. The spear-phishing email contains a link or a file that, when clicked or opened, unleashes a payload that takes over the target machine.",
        "Execution": "Rocket Kitten utilizes several different malware types to execute their attacks. They use both simple tools they likely developed and more advanced, publicly available ones, which may have been either purchased or stolen. Despite their lack of professionalism, as evidenced by content mistakes, they compensate with persistence. The group uses a keylogger detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_WOOLERG, which logs keystrokes and connects applications to victims' Gmail accounts as a 'connected app', allowing attackers to download all of their victims' emails for offline processing. They also install other pieces of malware as needed.",
        "Persistence": "Rocket Kitten demonstrates persistence by repeatedly attempting to attack the same targets, using new cover stories and techniques to entice users. They execute numerous password-reset attempts to overwhelm targets, making them believe they are losing control over their accounts. The group prefers to target victims' private email addresses and accounts rather than organizational ones, taking advantage of the lack of peripheral protection at home.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Rocket Kitten employs various defense evasion techniques, including using fake identities, making phone calls, and sending messages to gain trust. They breach websites to set up phishing pages or register new domains solely for phishing. The group also uses anti-debugging techniques and obfuscates their strings and API calls to avoid detection.",
        "Credential Access": "Rocket Kitten uses social engineering and spear phishing to steal credentials. They take over accounts immediately after obtaining passwords through emails, Facebook messages, or phone calls. They employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts like Facebook, other email accounts, and cloud accounts.",
        "Command and Control": "The infected computers communicate with a C&C server, which can download whatever malware is available or intended for the purpose of the attack. The group uses C&C communication to monitor communications and extract information from the victims."
