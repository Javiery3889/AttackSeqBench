        "Initial Access": "The IEXPL0RE RAT was delivered to human rights-related organizations via email attachments using social engineering techniques. The emails were tailored to the targets with relevant subjects and content. The attachments included executables disguised as legitimate files, such as images or documents, using techniques like Unicode right-to-left override characters. In one instance, an executable was designed to appear as a video of a speech by the Dalai Lama. The attachments were often in password-protected archives, with the password provided in the email, to evade antivirus detection.",
        "Execution": "Upon opening the document or running the program, the IEXPL0RE RAT installs a launcher program on the victim's computer. This launcher program is custom-generated for each target, making it difficult for signature-based antivirus programs to detect. The launcher goes through multiple stages to unpack and run the actual RAT, which is never written to disk but injected into memory.",
        "Persistence": "The IEXPL0RE RAT establishes persistence by installing a binary and a startup link in the Start Menu and leaving traces in the %temp% folder. It also uses files for configuration and recording keystrokes, such as lock.dat, MSMAPI32.SRG, and STREAM.SYS.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The IEXPL0RE RAT employs various defense evasion techniques. It is delivered in a custom-generated launcher program to evade signature-based antivirus detection. The RAT also uses a multi-stage unpacking process, with the final payload injected into memory rather than written to disk, making it harder to detect.",
        "Collection": "The IEXPL0RE RAT is capable of recording keystrokes, including passwords, and sending this data back to the command and control server at regular intervals. It also has the functionality to download files and install more specific malware, such as a Skype plugin that records calls.",
        "Command and Control": "The IEXPL0RE RAT communicates with a command and control (C2) server using HTTP POST and GET methods, with all communication encrypted. The C2 server is specified in a configuration file built into the RAT program. The RAT has exhibited different C2 communication behaviors over time, indicating active development and monitoring.",
        "Others": "The IEXPL0RE RAT is actively developed, with both client and server components continuously changing. The server has shown different behaviors to block unauthorized access, such as redirecting to Microsoft's website when an invalid URL is referenced. The RAT contains over 40 commands for file system and registry manipulation, data exfiltration, and real-time control of the system. It also has specific functionality for plugins relating to video and audio capture, indicating an interest in collecting data on the targets' appearances."
