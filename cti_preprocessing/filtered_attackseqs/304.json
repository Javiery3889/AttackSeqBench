        "Initial Access": "The FastPOS malware, identified as TSPY_FASTPOS.SMZTDA, infiltrated systems through three methods: links to a compromised medical site discussing laser surgical techniques, a real-time file sharing service, and direct file transfer via VNC. The latter suggests either compromised company credentials or brute-forced usernames and passwords.",
        "Credential Access": "FastPOS employed keylogging and RAM scraping to steal information. The keylogger, similar to that in NewPOSThings, stored keystrokes in memory and transmitted them to the attacker upon pressing the Enter key. This could include user credentials, PII, and payment information. The RAM scraper was designed specifically for credit card information theft, with checks to ensure the capture of valid card numbers. It excluded cards requiring PINs for transactions and verified the card's service code, targeting those with codes 101 or 201.",
        "Collection": "FastPOS's RAM scraper focused on immediate transmission of stolen credit card information to the attacker, rather than local storage. It included a feature to verify the card's service code, ensuring the theft of valid card numbers suitable for international use, specifically those with service codes 101 or 201.",
        "Command and Control": "Stolen information was immediately uploaded to a hardcoded C&C server without local storage. The data was sent as parameters in the server's URL. The use of GET commands, typically for file retrieval, was chosen possibly to reduce suspicion, as it mimics standard browser requests for websites. However, the lack of HTTPS meant that the data was sent unencrypted, exposing it to potential interception by other threat actors.",
        "Exfiltration": "FastPOS did not store any information or status logs locally. Instead, it immediately uploaded any stolen information to a C&C server. The information was uploaded using GET commands in the server's URL, which included logged keystrokes and RAM scraper data. The lack of HTTPS in the communication meant that the victim's data was sent without encryption.",
        "Others": "The FastPOS malware was designed for quick and efficient credit card theft, targeting smaller network environments such as those with a simple DSL modem as the primary network gateway. The malware's victims were distributed globally, with identified cases in Brazil, the United States, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, France, and industries including veterinary clinics, food, and logistics. The malware's design suggests it was intended for environments with a smaller footprint, relying on endpoint detection rather than network-level detection. Advanced endpoint solutions are recommended to combat such threats. The creators of FastPOS were also selling stolen credentials via the same server used to receive them."
