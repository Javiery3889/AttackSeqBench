        "Resource Development": "ShadowPad is a privately sold modular malware platform with plugins sold separately, regularly updated with advanced anti-detection and persistence techniques. It is used by at least four clusters of espionage activity and was the primary backdoor in multiple campaigns, including CCleaner, NetSarang, and ASUS supply-chain attacks. The adoption of ShadowPad reduces development and maintenance costs for threat actors, leading some to cease developing their own backdoors after gaining access to ShadowPad. Claims of attribution require caution when ShadowPad is involved. Local personas involved in ShadowPad's development are discussed as an iterative successor to PlugX.",
        "Initial Access": "ShadowPad emerged as the successor to PlugX and gained attention after several infamous supply-chain incidents. It is privately shared among a limited set of users and has a plugin-based design with runtime insertion capabilities, extending its functionalities for users. ShadowPad's controller, written in Delphi, can generate malware and control backdoor communications, managing infected hosts, C&C server listeners, and building new ShadowPad shellcode pieces.",
        "Execution": "ShadowPad's modular design allows for dynamic loading of additional plugins from the C&C server. A discovered controller version from 2015 provides insights into the builder's capabilities, including modifying campaign codes, anti-debugger settings, installation settings, process injection settings, C&C servers, and connection modes. The controller's interface manages infected hosts and plugins, with a default set embedded in samples and the option to upload additional plugins.",
        "Persistence": "ShadowPad's design allows users to remotely deploy new plugins to a backdoor. However, the control interfaces of the plugins are hardcoded in the controller, suggesting it was not created as a collaborative attacking framework. The builder allows users to modify various settings but does not let users choose which plugins are compiled into the generated sample, indicating a high level of control by the developer. ShadowPad is likely sold to users, with each plugin sold separately, rather than as a full bundle.",
        "Defense Evasion": "ShadowPad is under active maintenance, enhancing its anti-forensics capabilities. It is used for long-term espionage in victim environments, with threat actors selecting high-privilege systems to reduce detection probability. Proactive scanning and health checks on high-privilege hosts are essential for discovering attackers' footprints.",
        "Others": "ShadowPad is used by at least five activity clusters since 2017, including APT41, Tick and Tonto Team, Operation Redbonus, Operation Redkanku, and Fishmonger. These clusters have targeted various sectors, including gaming, electronics, universities, telecommunications, NGOs, foreign governments, and health organizations. The use of ShadowPad has shifted the landscape from developing to acquiring backdoors, reducing operation costs and complicating attribution efforts. The emergence of ShadowPad offers threat actors a well-developed backdoor that is actively maintained, making it difficult for security researchers to attribute campaigns to specific China-based threat actors."
