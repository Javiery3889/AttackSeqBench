        "Initial Access": "A large number of state organizations and businesses from various industry fields in the Ukraine and Poland have been targeted in recent attacks. The most effective infection vectors appear to be spear-phishing emails with subjects related to the current Ukrainian crisis combined with the exploitation of MS Office documents. CVE-2014-1761 was also used to spread BlackEnergy.",
        "Defense Evasion": "BlackEnergy is a trojan which has undergone significant functional changes since it was first publicly analyzed by Arbor Networks in 2007. It has evolved from a relatively simple DDoS trojan into a sophisticated piece of modern malware with a modular architecture. The malware includes techniques for bypassing UAC, defeating the signed driver requirement in Windows, and a selection of BlackEnergy2 plug-ins used for parasitic file infections, network discovery, remote code execution, and data collection.",
        "Others": "The most recent campaigns leveraging BlackEnergy are dated August 2014. The malware has been used for sending spam, online bank fraud, and targeted attacks. BlackEnergy version 2, which featured rootkit techniques, was documented by SecureWorks in 2010. The targeted attacks recently discovered are proof that the trojan is still active. The technical analysis of the BlackEnergy family focuses on novel functionality and the differences introduced by new 'lite' variants. The many targets in the Ukraine and Poland have been infected through several known and unknown infection vectors."
