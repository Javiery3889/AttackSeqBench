        "Initial Access": "The ATMitch malware was manually installed on the victim ATM after a wide enterprise network intrusion, enabling cyber-criminals to manipulate the cash-withdrawal process.",
        "Execution": "The ATMitch malware, initially contained within a custom loader named 'tester.exe', injects the actual payload into the 'fwmain32.exe' process using the 'SetThreadContext' injection technique (Thread Hijacking).",
        "Defense Evasion": "The ATMitch malware disguises its payload as a resource within the loader and uses a thread hijacking technique to inject the payload into the target process, avoiding detection.",
        "Discovery": "ATMitch targets the 'fwmain32.exe' process, which is part of the software services produced by Wincor Nixdorf International GmbH, indicating the malware's awareness of its banking environment.",
        "Command and Control": "ATMitch does not exhibit typical command and control traffic; instead, it operates by reading commands from a file in the 'c:\\intel' folder and logs actions into 'c:\\intel\\__log.txt'.",
        "Impact": "ATMitch interacts with ATM drivers to retrieve information about the current amount and dispense money, using the 'msxfs.dll' library to communicate with ATM components such as the PIN pad and cash dispenser.",
        "Others": "The ATMitch malware sample was discovered to be potentially active since 2017 and may be related to the APT group responsible for a previous compromise of a Russian bank. The malware requires the 'msxfs.dll' library to interact with ATM components and has a structured logging system. The attack flow involves manual installation via Remote Desktop, command execution, and log examination by the attacker."
