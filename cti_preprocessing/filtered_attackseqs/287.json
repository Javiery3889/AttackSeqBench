The initial file was an Access 2013 database (.accde format) that dropped a fake Word document, an Excel spreadsheet, and a VBA dropper called mm.accdb.core, which executed a .NET DLL payload. In 2020, GADOLINIUM sent spear-phishing emails with malicious PowerPoint attachments related to COVID-19, which dropped a file named doc1.dotm.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "GADOLINIUM used tools like LazyCat, which includes privilege escalation and credential dumping capabilities, to enable lateral movement across victim networks. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects the privilege escalation technique used by LazyCat.",
        "Defense Evasion": "GADOLINIUM has been using cloud services and open-source tools to obfuscate their activity and make it difficult for analysts to track. They have used cloud-based technology to create a malicious infrastructure that can be quickly established and taken down before detection or given up at little cost.",
        "Command and Control": "GADOLINIUM used Outlook Tasks as a mechanism for command and control (C2), utilizing a controlled OAuth access token to call the Outlook Task API. They also installed web shells on legitimate websites for C2 or traffic redirection. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects web shells by analyzing web server telemetry. In 2020, GADOLINIUM's PowerShell Empire toolkit allowed attackers to load additional modules to victim computers via Microsoft Graph API calls, using the attacker's Microsoft OneDrive account to execute commands and retrieve results between attacker and victim systems.",
        "Others": "Microsoft Security tracks advanced threat actors like GADOLINIUM and shares findings to harden products and platforms. Microsoft suspended 18 Azure Active Directory applications part of GADOLINIUM's malicious C2 infrastructure, protecting customers transparently. GADOLINIUM, a nation-state activity group, has been compromising targets for nearly a decade, focusing on the maritime and health industries, and has expanded targeting to the Asia Pacific region, higher education, and regional government organizations. Microsoft's proactive defense measures include detecting individual attack components and preventing attackers from using cloud infrastructure to execute attacks."
