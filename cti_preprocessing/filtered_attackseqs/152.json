        "Initial Access": "On July 16, 2017, actors associated with the OilRig campaign sent emails to five different individuals within the targeted Middle Eastern technology organization. All emails had the same subject, attachment filename, and attached Excel file (SHA256: 3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6).",
        "Execution": "The Excel file attached to the delivery email contained a malicious macro that, when enabled, would unhide and display a new worksheet with a fake invoice for Citrix products. While displaying the decoy invoice, the macro would silently run malicious code in the background to install its payload. The payload, a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan tracked as ISMAgent (SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9), was written to the file %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\servicereset.exe after concatenating base64 encoded strings. A VBScript named %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\OfficeServicesStatus.vbs was created to execute the 'servicereset.exe' file using the command line. A scheduled task named 'OfficeServicesStatus' was set to run every three minutes for persistence.",
        "Persistence": "A scheduled task named 'OfficeServicesStatus' was created to run every three minutes, ensuring the persistence of the ISMAgent payload on the compromised system.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attack utilized a fake compatibility warning message and a decoy invoice document to trick the user and minimize suspicions of malicious activity. The malicious macro was designed to silently install the ISMAgent payload while displaying the decoy document.",
        "Command and Control": "The ISMAgent Trojan used HTTP requests and DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server. The Trojan parsed received data from the C2 server for a GUID field and commands to run on the compromised system. The C2 server issued commands such as system information gathering and network configuration discovery. The Trojan executed the commands using cmd.exe and sent the output back to the C2 server via HTTP POST requests. The C2 domain used for the attack was ntpupdateserver[.]com, with additional infrastructure including microsoft-publisher[.]com and adobeproduct[.]com.",
        "Others": "The OilRig campaign, potentially linked to the Greenbug threat group, has shown iterative behavior in their toolset, maintaining some similarities over time. The inclusion of ISMAgent within the OilRig toolset suggests stronger relationships between various groups operating in the Middle East. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from these threats with classified samples by WildFire, IPS signatures, and AutoFocus tags. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include various SHA256 hashes of Clayslide documents delivering ISMAgent, ISMAgent payloads, and related infrastructure domains."
