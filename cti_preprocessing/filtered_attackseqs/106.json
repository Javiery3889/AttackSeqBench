They employed phishing emails with links to download Office documents containing decoy content. Upon clicking the link and downloading the document, the host system would be compromised, and an Office Macro Script would be loaded to facilitate further malicious activities.",
        "Execution": "The execution phase involved the use of Office Macro Scripts to load the Chinotto malware onto the compromised host systems. Additionally, PowerShell and Golang malware were used alongside BITSAdmin for DLL Side-Loading to execute malicious scripts and establish command and control.",

The compromised host analysis revealed the use of UltraVNC.ini and Ultra VNC Server for information collection, indicating the presence of mobile infostealer malware and command and control capabilities developed in Golang (ably).",

They also used Golang malware to communicate with the attacker's channel, sending commands and receiving command results through an Ably key and Client Hello messages.",
        "Exfiltration": "The exfiltration process involved sending data from compromised hosts to the attackers' infrastructure. Specific PHP scripts such as '/kcp/cfg/cat/hp/proc.php' were used to exfiltrate data. Additionally, the attackers used BITSAdmin to transfer malware to the victims' systems, as indicated by the command line used for the operation.",
        "Others": "The report includes the concept of 'Defend Forward,' developed by the US Department of Defense to proactively disrupt or stop malicious cyber activities at an early stage and increase the cost to adversaries. This approach involves an aggressive defensive mindset, identifying victims, incident response, and takedown of distribution sites. The incident response process includes malware analysis, investigation, C2 monitoring, threat tracking, identification of additional victims, blocking command and control and download sites, and developing countermeasures to prevent recurrence."
