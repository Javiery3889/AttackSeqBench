These emails included attachments such as RAR, DOCX, DOCM, LNK, and SFX files, which, when executed, launched various stages of the attack.",

They embedded OLE objects in documents that requested remote template files containing malicious code. Additionally, they used a malicious LNK file within a TAR archive to initiate an attack stage using mshta.exe, which launched a VBScript.",
