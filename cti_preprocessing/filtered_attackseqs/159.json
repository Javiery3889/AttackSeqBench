        "Initial Access": "The CTI report by F-Secure Weblog details an incident where a malicious Tor exit node, located in Russia, was used to modify Windows executables downloaded through it. The executables were wrapped with a second, malicious executable that bypassed integrity checks and executed alongside the original file.",
        "Execution": "Upon execution, the wrapper from the malicious Tor exit node writes to disk and executes both the original and the malicious executable. The latter is a dropper containing an encrypted DLL file, which is decrypted, written to disk, and executed.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The OnionDuke malware uses a wrapper to bypass integrity checks of the original executable, allowing the malicious executable to run undetected.",
        "Credential Access": "The OnionDuke malware family includes components for stealing login credentials from the victim machine.",
        "Discovery": "OnionDuke malware components are designed to gather information on the compromised system, such as the presence of antivirus software or a firewall.",
        "Command and Control": "The OnionDuke malware connects to hardcoded C&C URLs specified in the embedded configuration data. The domains contacted are believed to be compromised legitimate websites, not dedicated malicious servers. One component of OnionDuke contains a different hardcoded C&C domain and may use Twitter as an additional C&C channel.",
        "Others": "The OnionDuke malware has been linked to the Russian APT family MiniDuke, known for targeted attacks against NATO and European government agencies. The shared infrastructure between OnionDuke and MiniDuke suggests a connection between the actors behind them. The malware has been active since at least the end of October 2013 and has been used in both mass-infection strategies and targeted attacks against European government agencies. The use of Tor exit nodes for malicious activities highlights the risks associated with downloading binaries without encryption."
