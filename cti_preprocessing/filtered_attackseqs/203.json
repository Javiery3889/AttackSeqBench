        "Initial Access": "On 18 March 2022, a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists specializing in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was identified. The campaign involved malicious artifacts sent from the personal email of a former director of South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS). One of these artifacts was a new malware sample named GOLDBACKDOOR, which was deployed through a multi-stage process designed to avoid detection by antivirus or endpoint security. The initial access was achieved by tricking users into downloading a ZIP file named 'Kang Min-chol Edits 2.zip' from a domain impersonating NK News and executing a compressed Windows shortcut within it.",
        "Execution": "The execution of GOLDBACKDOOR involved a Windows shortcut file named 'Kang Min-chol Edits 2.lnk' that masqueraded as a document and executed a PowerShell script. This script wrote and opened a decoy document before starting the deployment process of GOLDBACKDOOR. The PowerShell script then decoded and executed a second PowerShell script, which downloaded and executed a shellcode payload named Fantasy from Microsoft OneDrive.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The deployment of GOLDBACKDOOR was designed to avoid detection by antivirus or endpoint security. The attackers used a multi-stage process and obfuscated PowerShell scripts to deploy the malware. The use of a domain impersonating NK News and the padding of the LNK file with NOP bytes were also part of the evasion techniques.",
        "Command and Control": "GOLDBACKDOOR utilized cloud service providers, specifically Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs, for receiving actor commands and exfiltrating data. The malware provided attackers with basic remote command execution, file downloading/uploading, keylogging, and the ability to remotely uninstall.",
        "Others": "The threat actor APT37, also known as Ricochet Chollima, is assessed with medium-high confidence to be behind the GOLDBACKDOOR malware, based on technical overlaps with the malware BLUELIGHT. The campaign targeted journalists and leveraged impersonation tactics. Stairwell's analysis linked GOLDBACKDOOR to BLUELIGHT through shared development resources and methods. The malware's functionality focused on file collection and keylogging, with a list of file extensions checked by the malware provided in the report. A tracking document was also used by the attackers to gain visibility into when and where the document was opened, indicating sophisticated operational security tradecraft."
