        "Initial Access": "On January 9, 2019, the 360 Threat Intelligence Center detected multiple bait documents designed for Arabic speakers. These phishing documents were Office Excel files carrying malicious macros. The macros ultimately released and executed a backdoor program written in C# that used complex DNS tunneling techniques to communicate with the C2 server and execute commands. Additionally, the backdoor utilized the Google Drive API for file uploads and downloads.",
        "Execution": "The malicious macro code embedded in the bait document, an Office Excel file named \".xlsm\" (indexes.xlsm), was designed to release the WINDOWSTEMP.ps1 and 12-B-366.txt files into the %TEMP% directory. The latter file, which is actually an HTA (HTML Application) file, was used to launch the PowerShell script released earlier. The PowerShell script, WINDOWSTEMP.ps1, decoded and decompressed the content within the script using Base64 and gzip, wrote it to the file %TEMP%\\OfficeUpdateService.exe, and then executed %TEMP%\\OfficeUpdateService.exe.",
        "Persistence": "The backdoor program, after execution, would check for the presence of \"st:off\" and \"pd:off\" parameters. If \"st:off\" was included, it would not write startup items, and if \"pd:off\" was included, it would not release PDF files. It also performed checks for virtual machines, sandboxes, or debugging environments. If these checks were passed, it would execute malicious code and write startup items for persistence.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The backdoor program performed evasion techniques such as checking for virtual machines, sandboxes, and debugging environments to avoid detection.",
        "Discovery": "The backdoor program gathered host information after executing evasion techniques.",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoor program established communication with the C2 server through DNS tunneling. The communication part was encapsulated in the queryTypesTest function. The command dispatch loop first determined if it was in x_mode; if not, it communicated with the C2 server via DNS tunneling to receive instructions. If in x_mode, it used HTTP for data transmission. The program parsed the data returned from the C2 server, extracted commands, and distributed them through the taskHandler function.",
        "Others": "The 360 Threat Intelligence Center, after detailed analysis, associated the attack with the DarkHydrus APT organization, which targets government agencies in the Middle East. The sample used DNS tunneling for communication, similar to malware previously disclosed by Palo Alto. The sandbox detection code and backdoor functionality code were highly consistent with previous findings. A Twitter user with the nickname Steve Williams was linked to the DarkHydrus username, and the nickname Williams was related to the PDB path of the C# written backdoor program. The attackers used Office VBA macros to execute malicious code due to the high cost of exploiting Office 0day vulnerabilities. The 360 Threat Intelligence Center's full product line, including the 360 Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), SkyEye Advanced Threat Detection System, and 360 NGSOC, now supports precise detection of such attacks."
