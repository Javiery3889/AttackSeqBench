        "Initial Access": "Since around October 2016, JPCERT/CC has been observing targeted emails sent to Japanese organizations. These emails contain a ZIP file attachment with executable files, which are disguised as Word documents using icons. The emails impersonate existing individuals and originate from free email services in Japan. Upon execution, the malware known as ChChes infects the system.",
        "Defense Evasion": "ChChes, a malware variant, employs a technique to communicate with its command and control (C&C) servers using HTTP cookie headers. The malware's HTTP requests use a path pattern of /[random string].htm, but the cookie values are encrypted strings that correspond to actual data for C&C communication. The encryption can be decrypted using a provided Python script. ChChes has been confirmed to use a specific code signing certificate to sign the executable files, which is detailed in Appendix A of the report.",
        "Command and Control": "ChChes communicates with C&C servers to receive commands and modules, which are then loaded into memory. The malware has limited functions on its own and relies on modules from C&C servers to expand its capabilities. The communication is initially encrypted using a custom method and later with AES encryption. The malware's communication flow includes an initial request containing encrypted data with the computer name, followed by a response from the C&C server with an ID for the infected machine. Subsequent requests are made for modules and commands, which are also encrypted. The malware can execute shell commands, upload and download files, run DLLs, and view tasks of bot commands.",
        "Others": "ChChes has been active since around October 2016 and is considered a new type of malware. JPCERT/CC is monitoring ChChes for continued use in targeted attacks. The report includes hash values of the malware samples in Appendix C and a list of destination hosts confirmed by JPCERT/CC in Appendix D. It is recommended to check for communication with these hosts to identify potential infections."
