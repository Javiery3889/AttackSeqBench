        "Initial Access": "The CTI report by ASEC (AhnLab Security Emergency-response Center) details the exploitation of a Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files. These files were first discovered in mid-2017 and continue to be a threat, targeting public sectors and cryptocurrency-related organizations. The attackers impersonate government institutions or organizations to distribute the malware, which has seen an increase in activity due to the COVID-19 situation, particularly in April 2020.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The report outlines changes in the attack methods, specifically in the PostScript code used in malicious EPS files within HWP documents. Attackers have shifted from previous methods like XOR encoding and obfuscation to a new approach using PostScript syntax. This change simplifies the code, making it harder to distinguish from normal EPS files and potentially avoiding detection.",
        "Collection": "The report includes a collection of malicious HWP file samples discovered from January to May 2020, with file details indicating targeted attacks on specific professions or groups. The files often impersonated government inquiries or job-related documents.",
        "Others": "AhnLab's anti-malware product, V3, detects and blocks HWP malware using aliases such as HWP/Exploit, Exploit/HWP.Generic, Exploit/EPS.Generic, and Malware/MDP.Behavior.M2411. The report concludes with the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms and emphasizes the importance of continuous analysis and assessment."
