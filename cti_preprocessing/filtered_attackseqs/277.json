        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report by Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov, dated March 13, 2018, details the reconnaissance efforts of cybercriminals targeting medical networks. The authors describe the use of masscan to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords. They also mention the use of specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources of these organizations. The report highlights the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication, which could be exploited for further reconnaissance.",
        "Discovery": "The report discusses the discovery of various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated Building Management systems and printers with unprotected web interfaces. It also notes the presence of medical devices like spirometers or blood pressure monitors that support MQTT protocol and are discoverable online, indicating a potential for unauthorized access and control.",
        "Others": "The report provides an overview of the threats affecting medical networks, with statistics showing that over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017. It also discusses the targeting of pharmaceutical organizations by APT actors using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data, suggesting an interest in intellectual property or business plans. The authors recommend removing medical data nodes from public access, updating software, and avoiding connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN as measures to mitigate these threats."
