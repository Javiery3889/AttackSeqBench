        "Initial Access": "The GroundPeony threat group, also known as UNC3347, has been actively targeting East and South Asian countries since at least 2021. They have been observed exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, Follina (CVE-2022-30190), and compromising target-related websites to distribute malware. The group's recent campaign involved spear-phishing emails with lure documents and URL obfuscation to download and execute malicious payloads from compromised websites, ultimately establishing communication with a C&C server.",
        "Execution": "The GroundPeony campaign utilized a malicious executable named \".exe\" or \"Install.exe\" which was copied and renamed to \"mic.exe\" for DLL side-loading. The side-loaded DLL, \"version.dll\", functioned as a shellcode launcher for \"mic.doc\", which is a shellcode downloader known as micDown. The \"mic.ver\" file served as a config file for \"mic.doc\". The attack flow involved executing the renamed executable, loading and decrypting the associated files, and communicating with the C&C server.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The GroundPeony campaign exhibited defense evasion techniques through the use of DLL side-loading, specifically with the \"version.dll\" file. This file was used to decode and launch shellcode from \"mic.doc\". The decoding process was a two-step procedure involving custom XOR operations. Additionally, the \"mic.doc\" payload had its MZ header removed and was responsible for downloading encoded shellcode, which it would then decode using a similar custom XOR algorithm.",
        "Command and Control": "The GroundPeony campaign established command and control (C&C) communication through the use of a C&C server, identified by the domain \"app.onedrivo.com\" with the IP address 172.93.189.239. The \"mic.ver\" config file contained encoded information for connecting to the C&C server, including the IP address and port, which was decoded to facilitate communication.",
        "Others": "The GroundPeony threat group, also known as UNC3347, is a China-nexus threat group active since at least 2021, targeting government, research, educational institutes, and telecom sectors in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Nepal, and India. The group has been linked to past campaigns exploiting the Follina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190) and has used infrastructure associated with PublicDomainRegistry, AS63734 (365 Online technology joint stock company), AS55720 (Gigabit Hosting Sdn Bhd), and AS 30823 (combahton GmbH). Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include various SHA256 hashes and IP addresses/domains such as 103.199.17.184, 160.20.145.111, and *.onedrivo.com."
