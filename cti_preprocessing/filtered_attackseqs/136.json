The adversaries employ spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information and compromise victims.",
        "Initial Access": "Dropping Elephant uses spear-phishing with documents containing remote content that sends a 'ping' to the attackers' server upon opening. A subsequent spear-phishing email with an MS Word document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or a PowerPoint document exploiting CVE-2014-6352 is sent. They also use watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a PowerPoint document to view the entire article, which contains a malicious artifact.",

        "Defense Evasion": "The backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts, which are then executed to download additional malware. This method of using encoded blobs helps evade detection.",

        "Collection": "The file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions (doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, pdf) and uploads them to the C2 server.",

        "Others": "The Dropping Elephant artifacts are detected by Kaspersky Lab products under various signatures. Kaspersky Lab collaborates with CERTs and LEAs to notify victims and mitigate the threat. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include a list of backdoors, exploit documents, domains, IPs, and C2 redirectors."
