        "Initial Access": "On October 10, 2017, Kaspersky Lab identified a new Adobe Flash zero-day exploit used in the wild against their customers. The exploit was delivered through a Microsoft Office document.",
        "Execution": "The Flash object within the Office document contained an ActionScript responsible for extracting the exploit using a custom packer seen in other FinSpy exploits. The exploit, a memory corruption vulnerability in the 'com.adobe.tvsdk.mediacore.BufferControlParameters' class, allowed arbitrary read/write operations in memory, enabling the execution of a second stage shellcode.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The FinSpy malware payload used anti-analysis techniques, including a custom packer and a virtual machine to execute code. The malware's virtual machine supported 34 instructions and was designed to execute native code specified in the parameter field.",
        "Command and Control": "The initial shellcode's main purpose was to download second stage shellcode from a specified URL. The final payload, 'mo.exe', communicated with three C2 servers for further control and exfiltration of data. Two of these C2 servers had been used in the past with other FinSpy payloads.",
        "Exfiltration": "The second stage shellcode downloaded the final payload (FinSpy) and a lure document to display to the victim from the same IP, then executed the payload and displayed the lure document.",
        "Others": "The attack was linked to the BlackOasis APT, which has been active since at least June 2015, utilizing at least five zero-days to deliver FinSpy malware. BlackOasis targets figures involved in Middle Eastern politics and other regions, with victims observed in multiple countries. Kaspersky Lab has reported the vulnerability to Adobe, resulting in a patch. Users of Kaspersky products are protected against this threat by specific detections. The article acknowledges Adobe PSIRT for their cooperation."
