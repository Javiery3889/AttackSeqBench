        "Initial Access": "The CTI report by eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) identified a campaign where corporate employees on LinkedIn were targeted using fake job offers containing the Golden Chickens malware suite. In a subsequent campaign, corporate hiring managers received fake resumes laden with malware. These tactics reversed the attack vector, initially targeting employees and later targeting hiring managers.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Golden Chickens malware suite, developed by badbullzvenom, has been designed to be stealthy and evade detection by most antivirus companies. The malware is intended for use only in targeted attacks to maintain a low profile and avoid widespread detection.",
        "Others": "eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU) has been tracking the Golden Chickens malware suite, used by cybercrime groups FIN6, Cobalt Group, and Evilnum, which has caused financial losses over USD $1.5 billion. The report reveals the identity of the threat actor behind Golden Chickens, known as badbullzvenom, and his connection to the Cobalt Gang. TRU has uncovered extensive personal information about badbullzvenom, including his real name, address, and social media accounts. The report also details the progression of badbullzvenom from a script kiddie to a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) provider and the ongoing development and sale of the Golden Chickens malware suite. TRU continues to track new attack campaigns leveraging this malware and provides recommendations for organizations to protect against it."
