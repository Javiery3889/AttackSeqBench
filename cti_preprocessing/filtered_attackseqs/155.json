        "Execution": "This blog details how Iron Tiger threat actors have updated their toolkit with an updated SysUpdate malware variant that now uses five files in its infection routine instead of the usual three. The threat actor used five files: dlpumgr32.exe, a legitimate signed file that belongs to the DESlock+ product; DLPPREM32.DLL, a malicious DLL sideloaded by dlpumgr32.exe that loads and decodes DLPPREM32.bin; DLPPREM32.bin, a shellcode that decompresses and loads a launcher in memory; data.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher and contains two SysUpdate versions: one for a 32-bit architecture and another for a 64-bit architecture; config.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher and contains the SysUpdate configuration, such as the command-and-control (C&C) address.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The launcher acts as an installer \n\nThe launcher starts by instantiating the CLoadInfo object, which has the following structure:\n\nOffset Description\n\nHardcoded values in our sample\n\nVTable of CLoadInfo class\n\nDirectory to copy all files\n\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\Test\\\n\nName of the legitimate executable\n\ndlpumgr32.exe\n\nName of the sideloaded DLL\n\nDLPPREM32.DLL\n\nName of the shellcode\n\nDLPPREM32.bin\n\nName of the encrypted payload\n\ndata.res\n\nMD5 of the encrypted payload\n\ne43e40416520dab5b4c44ac8af907078\n\nName of the encrypted configuration config.res\n\nName of the registry key value\n\nservTest\n\nName of the service DisplayName\n\nServdisplay\n\nTable 1. CLoadInfo object structure\n\nThe launcher's behavior changes depending on the number of arguments passed to the executable. It's important to highlight that the change of behavior only depends on the number of arguments, and not the content:\n\nNo argument. If there is no argument, a hardcoded directory will be created wherein all the files will be copied. The CreationTime, LastWriteTime, and LastAccessTime will be updated according to the C:\\Windows\\system32\\kernel32.dll file and their file attributes will be set to \"hidden\" and \"system\". Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) will be used to run dlpumgr32.exe with arguments \"-up-run -x\" and it will exit the current process.\n\nOne argument. It will skip the decoding of the configuration and persistence setup, and will perform the same behavior as one with three arguments.\n\nThree arguments.\n\nThe launcher first decrypts the config.res file with a hardcoded Data Encryption Standard (DES) key. It encodes it using another key and writes it to the registry key \"Software\\Classes\\scConfig\" (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive, depending on the privileges of the process).\n\nAfter decrypting the configuration, the config.res file is deleted.\n\nDepending on the privileges of the process, the malware will add a value to the \"Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" key, or it will create a service that runs the malware at boot time\n\nThe launcher decrypts the data.res file with a different hardcoded DES key. The result is a file with the following structure:\n\nSize of the 32-bit shellcode\n\n32-bit shellcode\n\nSize of the 64-bit shellcode\n\n64-bit shellcode\n\nTable 2. Structure of decrypted data.res file\n\nLastly, the launcher starts a suspended process with the command line \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k LocalServices,\" and injects the appropriate shellcode into it (either 32- or 64-bit). It will then resume the newly created process and exit the current process.\n\nThe following diagram summarizes the launch procedure:\n\nFigure 2. The launch procedure of the updated tool\n\nThe payload itself is a new version of SysUpdate."
