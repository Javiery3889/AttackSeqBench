        "Execution": "The Lazarus group, specifically its subgroup Bluenoroff, has been actively targeting financial organizations in Latin America. On September 19, 2018, they successfully installed backdoors on several machines belonging to financial institutions. These backdoors, identified as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A, were installed as services and are capable of executing various malicious functions such as collecting information, downloading files, launching or terminating processes, updating configuration data, deleting files, injecting code, utilizing proxies, opening reverse shells, and running in passive mode to receive commands through an open port.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Lazarus group's backdoors are sophisticated and difficult to detect. They employ a complex technique involving three major components: a loader DLL (AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll), an encrypted backdoor (Msadoz<n>.dll), and an encrypted configuration file (Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui). The loader DLL is installed as a service and is responsible for loading the encrypted backdoor to decrypt and execute it in memory. The encrypted configuration file contains the C&C information necessary for the backdoor to connect and conduct its activities. The backdoors are located in different directories, making it harder to detect and remove them.",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoors installed by the Lazarus group connect to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities. The servers identified are 107[.]172[.]195[.]20, 92[.]3[.]12[.]154, and 46[.]21[.]147[.]161.",
        "Others": "Trend Micro has identified the Lazarus group as a significant threat to enterprise security. They recommend routine scanning of networks for malicious activity, educating employees on social engineering techniques, and employing a multilayered approach to security, including endpoint hardening and application control. Trend Micro's security solutions, such as Smart Protection Suites, Worry-Free Business Security, Deep Discovery, and XGen security, are designed to detect and block the threats posed by groups like Lazarus."
