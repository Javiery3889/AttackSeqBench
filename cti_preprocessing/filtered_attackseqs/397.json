        "Initial Access": "On October 2, 2018, an alert was issued by US-CERT, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the Treasury, and the FBI, indicating that Hidden Cobra (the U.S. government's code name for Lazarus) has been conducting 'FASTCash' attacks to steal money from ATMs since at least 2016. Lazarus first breaches targeted banks' networks to gain initial access.",
        "Execution": "Lazarus deploys previously unknown malware, Trojan.Fastcash, to execute fraudulent ATM transactions. This malware intercepts fraudulent cash withdrawal requests and sends fake approval responses.",
        "Credential Access": "The Lazarus group uses real account numbers (PANs) to carry out FASTCash attacks. Most accounts used to initiate the transactions had minimal activity or zero balances. The method by which attackers gain control of these accounts is not clear.",
        "Impact": "The FASTCash operation by Lazarus has resulted in the theft of tens of millions of dollars from ATMs. The group has compromised banking application servers running unsupported versions of the AIX operating system, which are beyond their service pack support dates, to manipulate ATM transactions and withdraw cash fraudulently.",
        "Others": "Symantec has identified several variants of Trojan.Fastcash, each with different response logic tailored for specific transaction processing networks. The malware reads all incoming network traffic on compromised servers, scanning for ISO 8583 request messages containing attacker-used PAN numbers, and modifies these messages to approve fraudulent withdrawals. Lazarus is known for both cybercrime and espionage, with high-profile attacks such as the 2014 Sony Pictures breach and the WannaCry ransomware outbreak. They have extensive knowledge of banking systems and protocols, making them a significant threat to the financial sector. Symantec has implemented detections to protect against Lazarus FASTCash attacks and advises organizations to keep systems updated, especially those running unsupported AIX operating system versions."
