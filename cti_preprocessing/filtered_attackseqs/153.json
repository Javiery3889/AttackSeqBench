        "Reconnaissance": "The ENISA Threat Landscape report indicates that adversaries have been actively gathering information to support their cyber operations. This includes exploiting known vulnerabilities and using social engineering techniques such as phishing to collect sensitive data. The Lazarus Group, for example, has been reported to be more active in both financially and espionage motivated attacks, targeting cryptocurrency trading platform users and their systems. The report also mentions that adversaries have been targeting the technology industry to compromise the supply chain and look for vulnerabilities to exploit.",
        "Initial Access": "The report details several incidents where adversaries gained initial access through various means. Notably, the MEGA cloud service suffered a data breach exposing a vast number of emails and passwords. Verification.io experienced a significant data breach due to an unprotected MongoDB database, exposing over 800 million records. The Citrix systems were compromised by exploiting critical software vulnerabilities and employing password spraying techniques. Additionally, the cloud hosting provider iNSYNQ was attacked with ransomware, preventing customers from accessing their data.",
        "Execution": "The report highlights that installing malware is a common technique used by adversaries during the execution phase of an attack. Malware such as Emotet and Agent Tesla were frequently used to facilitate reconnaissance, lateral movement, data theft, and communication with C2 servers.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Adversaries have been using various defense evasion techniques, including the use of encrypted HTTPS connections to deliver malware, as reported in the ENISA Threat Landscape. This makes it challenging for security systems to detect and prevent such threats.",
        "Credential Access": "Credential stealing has been a significant part of cyberattacks, with adversaries using various methods to obtain sensitive authentication data. The report mentions that companies experience an average of 12 credential-stuffing attacks each month, where attackers successfully identify valid credentials.",
        "Others": "The ENISA Threat Landscape report discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cybersecurity, noting an increase in attacks targeting healthcare service providers and remote workers. The Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic, a major COVID-19 testing laboratory, suffered a cyberattack during the pandemic. ENISA has been mapping the threat landscape during this period and advising on mitigation measures to reduce exposure to threats."
