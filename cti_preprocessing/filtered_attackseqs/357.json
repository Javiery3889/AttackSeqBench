        "Reconnaissance": "In 2019, the Iranian cyberespionage group Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 or Ajax, initiated a new cyber espionage campaign targeting non-Iranian researchers from the US, Middle East, and France, focusing on academic research of Iran, as well as Iranian dissidents in the US. The group impersonated well-known researchers or journalists and invited recipients to events, using the targets' language in some cases. They also added trackers to their email correspondences to follow forwarded emails and obtain geolocation information.",
        "Resource Development": "Charming Kitten's campaign involved the use of fake websites impersonating various entities and services, including Google services like Gmail or Google Drive, and for the first time, Instagram's official website. These websites were used to extract credentials and were hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation in Bulgaria. The attackers switched servers used to store email addresses containing thousands of addresses after a month of campaign operations.",
        "Initial Access": "The campaign's first stage involved sending socially engineered email messages impersonating known researchers or journalists, inviting victims to events. The second stage redirected victims to decoy websites impersonating Google services and other entities. In August 2019, the group expanded its activities to target influential public figures worldwide.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Charming Kitten used email trackers to monitor whether their phishing emails were forwarded and to collect victims' geolocation and IP addresses. They also used a cookie installed on the victim's machine to gather data.",
        "Credential Access": "The attackers created phishing websites impersonating Instagram and Google services to steal credentials from victims. These websites were part of the campaign's second stage, which likely aimed at data theft.",
        "Command and Control": "Charming Kitten used more than six unique servers to host their fake websites, with four impersonating entities and two impersonating Google services. The servers were used to control the phishing websites and collect stolen data.",
        "Others": "ClearSky Security Ltd. attributed the campaign to Charming Kitten based on factors such as the use of specific websites linked in the attack, the targeting of non-Iranian investigators whose expertise fits Charming Kitten's TTPs, and the impersonation of NIAC, indicating an Iranian actor. The group's activity was also tied to Iran through the NetBlock of the IP addresses of the original servers, which included an Iranian company's website."
