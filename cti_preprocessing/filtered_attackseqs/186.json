        "Initial Access": "The campaign targeting Palestinian individuals and entities began with social engineering tactics. Attackers lured victims into opening email attachments or downloading reports on political affairs related to Palestine. The malicious files were disguised as Microsoft Word documents or executables, with names such as 'Reports on major developments__347678363764' and 'Employee-entitlements-2020.doc'.",
        "Execution": "Upon opening the malicious documents, victims were presented with decoy content to lower their suspicions while the Pierogi backdoor was installed. The decoy documents included politically charged content, such as fake government documents, news about Hamas, and criticism of Hamas. Weaponized Microsoft Word documents contained an embedded downloader macro that, when enabled, downloaded and executed the Pierogi backdoor.",
        "Persistence": "The Pierogi backdoor achieved persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder, ensuring it ran upon user login. The shortcut pointed to the backdoor's binary location in the 'C:\\ProgramData\\' folder.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Pierogi backdoor implemented checks for antivirus and security products, querying Windows for installed antivirus software using WMI and looking for specific products like Kaspersky and Bitdefender. It also used techniques such as file deletion and software packing to evade detection.",
        "Discovery": "The backdoor was capable of collecting information about the infected machine, including computer name, username, GUID, antivirus name, and operating system version.",
        "Collection": "Pierogi's capabilities included taking screenshots and executing arbitrary commands via the CMD shell, which could be used for data collection.",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoor communicated with C2 servers using predefined URLs for sending machine information, receiving commands, and uploading data such as screenshots. It also had the ability to remove information based on commands from the C2 server.",
        "Exfiltration": "Data exfiltration was performed through web services, with the backdoor uploading screenshots to the C2 server.",
        "Others": "The campaign, suspected to be conducted by MoleRATs, an Arabic-speaking APT group, used the Pierogi backdoor for cyber espionage. The backdoor, written in Delphi, had basic capabilities and checks for a safe running environment. The infrastructure for the campaign was created in November 2019, with domains registered and operationalized shortly after. Cybereason raises the possibility that the backdoor was obtained from underground communities rather than developed in-house."
