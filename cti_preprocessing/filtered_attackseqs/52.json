        "Initial Access": "During a normal monitoring activity, a suspicious email from the domain validtree.com was detected, which was registered through namecheap.com and protected by a Panama company named WhoisGuard. The domain recently renewed and currently resolves to an IP address assigned to LeaseWeb, a VPS hosting provider located in the Netherlands. The email contained a suspicious Word document with a macro dropper designed to execute a JavaScript payload.",
        "Execution": "The Word document contained two VBA-Macro functions, 'AutoOpen' and 'HeadrFooterProperty', which decoded a JavaScript payload. The payload was obfuscated to hinder analysis and used a XOR key to decode a third JavaScript stage that communicated with the IP 66.133.129.5, assigned to Frontier Communications Solutions.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attacker used obfuscation techniques in the VBA-Macro to decode the JavaScript payload, making the analysis process more challenging. The obfuscated code contained thematically chosen variable names such as 'theseus', 'pastorale', and 'quetzalcoatl'. The final JavaScript downloader was designed to drop a file from a specified URL into the system's temporary directory and execute it.",
        "Command and Control": "The final JavaScript downloader aimed to drop a file from a URL, placing it into the system's temporary directory and naming it 'nanagrams.exe', which would then be executed on the victim's machine. The dropping URL contained a 'surprise.php' file, which due to a misconfiguration, revealed its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe pointing to another domain and redirecting the downloader script to different URLs.",
        "Others": "The suspicious email targeted System Integrator Companies in Europe. The infrastructure used in the attack suggests the involvement of the cybercrime group TA505, known for operating the Dridex and Locky malware families. The group has been active since 2014, focusing on Retail and banking sectors. The attack used an old infrastructure previously associated with Ransomware propagation. The IoC includes a hash and several URLs related to the attack. A Yara rule was provided to help identify similar attacks."
