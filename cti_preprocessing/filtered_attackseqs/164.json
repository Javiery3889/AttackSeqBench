        "Initial Access": "The INOCNATION campaign utilized a decoy installer for Cisco AnyConnect Mobility Client to facilitate initial access. The installer, disguised as a legitimate application, would execute regardless of the victim's decision to cancel the installation, silently creating and entrenching the malware into the system's background. The use of a widely recognized security application as an embedded decoy indicates a sophisticated ploy to deceive average users or less experienced system administrators.",
        "Execution": "The INOCNATION campaign's RAT installer executed a malicious DLL payload, which was obfuscated and rebuilt during installation. The malware employed anti-behavioral analysis techniques, such as comparing mouse cursor positions to detect sandbox environments. Additionally, the malware used a mangled MZ header to deceive security products and evade detection.",
        "Persistence": "The RAT installer set up a persistence mechanism for the payload malware by creating a registry key for entrenchment. This key would be referenced during the uninstall routine, indicating the malware's capability to maintain its foothold on the system.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The INOCNATION campaign's malware exhibited several defense evasion techniques, including the use of XOR obfuscation for components and strings, sandbox detection, and a mangled MZ header to deceive security products. The malware also employed string stacking obfuscation with Unicode strings and multiple layers of obfuscation for its command and control traffic.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware used encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections for command and control communications, employing Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries. To further obfuscate the communications, the malware used a single-byte XOR encoding within the decrypted SSL/TLS communication. This additional layer of obfuscation was designed to thwart detection and analysis efforts, even in environments with SSL inspection devices.",
        "Others": "The INOCNATION campaign's malware was capable of receiving commands from its C2 server, including process execution, reverse shell, file activity, uploading and downloading files, system information retrieval, and uninstalling the malware. The uninstall command suggests that the threat actor aimed to maintain a limited number of victims by removing the tool when commanded. Fidelis Cybersecurity's products detect the activity documented in this report, and additional technical indicators are published on their GitHub repository. The malware samples analyzed in this report were shared by CrowdStrike."
