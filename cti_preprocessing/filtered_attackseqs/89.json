        "Initial Access": "Suckfly exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system (Windows) that allowed the attackers to bypass the User Account Control and install the Nidiran back door to provide access for their attack. While the delivery vector is unknown, a spear-phishing email may have been used due to the target's extensive open-source presence.",
        "Execution": "Suckfly used the Nidiran back door along with a number of hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts. The tools and malware used in this breach were also signed with stolen digital certificates.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials, allowing them to navigate the internal corporate network as though they were the employee.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Suckfly made its malware difficult to analyze to prevent their operations from being detected. The malware checks for an internet connection before running and attempts to communicate with the C&C domain over ports 443 and 8443.",
        "Credential Access": "Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials.",
        "Discovery": "Suckfly scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with ports 8080, 5900, and 40 open, looking to expand its foothold on the e-commerce company's internal network.",
        "Lateral Movement": "Suckfly used hacktools to move laterally and escalate privileges within the e-commerce company's internal network.",
        "Command and Control": "Suckfly's Nidiran back door communicated with the C&C domains, sending encrypted and hardcoded information including the network name, hostname, IP address, and the victim's operating system information.",
        "Exfiltration": "Suckfly's final step was to exfiltrate data off the victim\u2019s network and onto Suckfly\u2019s infrastructure using the Nidiran back door. The extent of stolen information is unknown.",
        "Others": "Suckfly conducted long-term espionage campaigns against government and commercial organizations in India, targeting high-profile entities such as government networks, a large e-commerce company, and its primary shipping vendor, one of India's top five IT firms, a US healthcare provider's Indian business unit, and two government organizations. The attacks were part of a planned operation against specific targets in India, with the government organizations showing a higher infection rate. Suckfly's activities suggest it is a professional organized group, operating Monday through Friday, and likely providing economic insight to the organization behind its operations. Symantec has detections in place to protect against Suckfly's malware."
