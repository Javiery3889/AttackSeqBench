        "Initial Access": "Volexity reported a strategic web compromise (SWC) of the South Korean online newspaper Daily NK's website, where malicious code was present from late March 2021 until early June 2021. The attackers, identified as North Korean APT InkySquid, modified legitimate files on the website to redirect users to attacker-owned domains hosting malicious JavaScript. This activity targeted Internet Explorer users, leveraging exploits such as CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411.",
        "Defense Evasion": "InkySquid attackers cleverly disguised exploit code within legitimate code on the compromised Daily NK website, making detection difficult. They also restricted access to the exploit code to only exploitable user-agents, further evading automated scanning and detection.",
        "Command and Control": "The BLUELIGHT malware, attributed to InkySquid, uses cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API for command and control operations. It performs oauth2 token authentication and sets up a directory structure in OneDrive for C2 protocol. The malware collects and uploads reconnaissance data, including system information and screenshots, and receives commands through the 'background' subdirectory.",
        "Others": "The BLUELIGHT malware, after successful exploitation, decrypts a final SVG variable containing a hex-encoded Cobalt Strike stager, which is then executed. The malware leverages Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations, collecting system information and screenshots, and supports various commands including file search, data harvesting, and implant uninstallation. IoCs and signatures related to this activity are available on Volexity's GitHub page."
