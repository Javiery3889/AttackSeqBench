        "Initial Access": "On 2019-10-26, a precision engineering company in Italy received a well-crafted email from steel@vardhman.com, which appeared to be from a legitimate company in the textile field. The email contained an attached Excel document requesting a quote for a list of spare parts, leveraging a tactic known as Spearphishing Attachment (T1193).",
        "Execution": "Upon opening the Excel document, the victim would see a realistic-looking spreadsheet without any macro code, thus not raising suspicion. However, the document contained a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882, allowing silent code execution without user interaction (T1204 - User Execution).",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attack employed several defense evasion techniques: T1107 (File Deletion) by deleting the original file after infection, T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing) as the threat came packed/encrypted.",
        "Credential Access": "The dropped PE file, educrety.exe, searched for stored passwords and access tokens in various registry keys, using techniques such as T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry).",
        "Collection": "The malware collected data from the local system (T1005 - Data from Local System).",
        "Command and Control": "The stolen credentials were sent to a command and control server at http[://www.corpcougar.com/edu/Panel/five/fre.php using common ports and standard application layer protocols (T1043 - Commonly Used Port and T1071 - Standard Application Layer Protocol).",
        "Exfiltration": "The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002 - Data Encrypted).",
        "Others": "The attack is attributed to a threat actor known as SWEED, which has similarities to previous campaigns and targets precision engineering companies in Italy. The malware used in the attack includes a dropped PE file with hash 64114c398f1c14d4e840f62395edd9a8c43d834708f8d8fce12f8a6502b0e981 and a malicious document with hash 863934c1fa4378799ed0c3e353603ba0bee3a357a5c63d845fe0d7f4ebc1a64c. The dropping URL is http[://mail.hajj.zeem.sa/wp-admin/edu/educrety.exe. The attack also involved the use of a Microsoft Office exploit and implementation of LokiBot."
