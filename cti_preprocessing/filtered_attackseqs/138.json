        "Initial Access": "Arid Viper, an advanced persistent threat actor, has been observed using a fully functional custom iOS surveillanceware named Phenakite, which is capable of stealing sensitive user data from iPhones without requiring the devices to be jailbroken prior to compromise. The malware was distributed through a mobile configuration profile, allowing a device-specific signed version of the iOS app to be installed on a victim's device. A jailbreak was necessary post-installation for the malware to elevate its privileges and retrieve sensitive user information not accessible via standard iOS permission requests. This was achieved with the publicly available Osiris jailbreak and the Sock Port exploit, both bundled in the malicious iOS app store packages (IPAs).",
        "Persistence": "Arid Viper's iOS surveillanceware, Phenakite, was designed to maintain persistence on compromised devices. It achieved this by tricking victims into installing a mobile configuration profile, which allowed for the delivery and installation of Phenakite, specifically signed for the target's iPhone. The malware also came bundled with the Osiris jailbreak and the Sock Port exploit, enabling it to jailbreak the device and gain elevated privileges post-installation.",
        "Command and Control": "Arid Viper's iOS surveillanceware, Phenakite, communicated with command and control (C2) servers to exfiltrate collected data. The malware was capable of recording audio, taking photos, and directing victims to phishing pages for Facebook and iCloud to steal credentials for those services. The C2 communication was facilitated through a misconfigured Firebase server, which showed 81 users at the time of analysis, although the true number of targets is likely lower."
