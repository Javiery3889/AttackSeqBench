        "Reconnaissance": "In March and April 2018, Volexity identified multiple spear phishing campaigns attributed to Patchwork, an Indian APT group also known as Dropping Elephant. This increase in threat activity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in blogs by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on Chinese organizations and Trend Micro noting targets in South Asia. From the attacks observed by Volexity, what is most notable is that Patchwork has pivoted its targeting and has launched attacks directly against US-based think tanks. Volexity has also found that, in addition to sending malware lures, the Patchwork threat actors are leveraging unique tracking links in their e-mails for the purpose of identifying which recipients opened their e-mail messages.",
        "Initial Access": "In three observed spear phishing campaigns, the threat actors leveraged domains and themes mimicking those of well-known think tank organizations in the United States. The group lifted articles and themes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) for use in their spear phishing lures and malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) documents. Strangely, in one case, the threat actors also appear to have used a domain name similar to the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) in a message purporting to be from CFR. Each of the spear phishing attacks contained links to .doc files, which were really RTF documents that attempt to exploit CVE-2017-8750 (Composite Moniker). The threat actors appear to have leveraged publicly available exploit code that can be found on Github at the URL: https://github.com/rxwx/CVE-2017-8570. If the exploit is successful, the threat actors will attempt to drop and execute QuasarRAT.",
        "Execution": "Upon opening the above attachments, the recipient will be presented with a document that is a direct copy of a blog post or report released by the think tank organization being impersonated. At first glance, everything might look legitimate, but in the background the target user has likely just been infected with QuasarRAT. QuasarRAT is a freely available \\",
        "Persistence": "After the initial dropper (qrat.exe) has been executed by the embedded scriptlet, it creates a directory in C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft Network\\microsoft_network\\1.0.0.0 and unpacks/drops the final QuasarRAT binary named microsoft_network.exe. The malware also contains an embedded .NET wrapper DLL for creating and managing scheduled tasks on Windows systems. The file, named Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll, is digitally signed by a certificate from AirVPN. This DLL is used to create a scheduled task that points to the QuasarRAT binary, microsoft_network.exe, allowing it to remain persistent after reboot.",
        "Command and Control": "Once the task is triggered, it will then repeat every 5 minutes for 60 days. When executed, microsoft_network.exe will initiate a request to freegeoip.net in order to determine the geographical location of the infected host. Immediately following the request, the malware will begin to beacon over an encrypted connection to the threat actor's command and control domain tautiaos.com (43.249.37.199)."
