        "Execution": "The attackers behind the New York Times network breach have deployed updated versions of their malware, Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe. Aumlib now encodes certain HTTP communications, and Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns to potentially evade detection.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The updated Aumlib malware encodes its HTTP POST body, differing from previous variants that transmitted data in clear text. This change may help it bypass existing Intrusion Detection System (IDS) signatures. Similarly, the new Ixeshe sample uses a different Base64 encoding pattern in its network traffic, which may evade signatures designed to detect Ixeshe-related infections.",
        "Command and Control": "The updated Aumlib malware sample, identified by hash value 832f5e01be536da71d5b3f7e41938cfb, was downloaded from URLs such as status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js or status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/css.css. It shares code with an older variant, which connected to documents[.]myPicture[.]info. The new Ixeshe sample, with hash aa873ed803ca800ce92a39d9a683c644, contains encoded data with victim information and a campaign tag, indicating a method of tracking attacks.",
        "Others": "The attackers, known as APT12, have been silent since January after an expose and have now re-emerged with improved malware. The changes in their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) suggest a deliberate evolution in response to external pressures, such as the exposure of their activities. Understanding these changes is crucial for predicting future modifications in their strategy."
