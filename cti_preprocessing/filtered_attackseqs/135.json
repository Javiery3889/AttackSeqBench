        "Initial Access": "The initial access in the Bandook campaign begins with a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered inside a ZIP file. This document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros. The external template is downloaded via URL shortening services like TinyURL or Bitly, which then redirects to a domain controlled by the attacker. The VBA code within the external template decrypts the embedded data from the original document and drops it into two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code). The themes of the lure documents often relate to cloud-based services such as Office365, OneDrive, and Azure, with images suggesting additional documents are available upon enabling macros. One document even depicted an Office365 logo and a preview of a certificate issued by the government of Dubai, specifically mentioning JAFZA - Jebel Ali Free Zone.",
        "Execution": "The execution phase involves the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script, which decodes and executes another base64 encoded PowerShell script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'. This script then downloads a zip file containing four files from a cloud service like Dropbox, Bitbucket, or an S3 bucket. The files 'a.png', 'b.png', and 'untitled.png' are used to generate the malware payload. 'untitled.png' contains a hidden RC4 function encoded in the pixels, created using invoke-PSImage. The final executable payload is assembled from decrypted 'a.png' and 'b.png' as is. The PowerShell script then executes the malware, opens 'draft.docx' (a benign document to mislead the victim), and cleans up the artifacts.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Bandook campaign employs various techniques to hinder analysis and detection. The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time. The malware payload is generated using image files to conceal its components, and the final Bandook payload is signed with valid certificates from Certum to appear trustworthy.",
        "Command and Control": "The Bandook loader, written in Delphi, uses the Process Hollowing technique to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of an Internet Explorer process. The payload then contacts the C&C server, sends basic information about the infected machine, and awaits further commands. The communication protocol with the C&C server has been upgraded to use AES encryption.",
        "Others": "The Bandook malware has a history dating back to 2007 and was developed by an individual nicknamed PrinceAli. Over time, the malware became publicly available for download. The variant used in the recent attacks is a slimmed-down version with only 11 supported commands, including file operations, taking screenshots, and file download/upload/execution. The campaign targets a wide range of sectors and locations, suggesting that the malware is part of an offensive infrastructure sold to governments and threat actors worldwide. The campaign shares similarities with previous campaigns attributed to the Lebanese General Security Directorate, known as 'Dark Caracal'. The operators behind the infrastructure of 'Operation Manul' and 'Dark Caracal' are believed to still be active and operational."
