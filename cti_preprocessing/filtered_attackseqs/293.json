        "Initial Access": "In April 2018, while monitoring public data feeds, the Iron cybercrime group was identified deploying a previously unknown backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code. The Iron group, also behind the Iron ransomware, has been active for approximately 18 months, developing malware for Windows, Linux, and Android platforms, infecting thousands of victims.",
        "Execution": "The Iron group's installer sample is protected with VMProtect and compressed using UPX. The installation process includes checking for VM execution, dropping and installing a malicious Chrome extension, creating a mutex based on the CPU's version, and dropping a backdoor DLL. Depending on the OS version, the malware either invokes a one-time execution for Windows XP or installs a malicious certificate and creates a service for newer versions.",
        "Persistence": "The Iron group's malware checks for the presence of 360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security before installing itself as a Windows service. If detected, the malware runs once without persistence. Otherwise, it installs a rogue root CA certificate to make its binaries appear legitimate.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Iron group's backdoor uses anti-VM techniques and dynamic function calls from HackingTeam's leaked source code to avoid detection. It also embeds a modified version of Adblock Plus for IE to inject remote JavaScript, although this functionality is not automatically used.",
        "Command and Control": "The Iron group's backdoor decrypts hardcoded shellcode to load a Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory using a reflective loader. It also fetches payload URLs from hardcoded Pastebin addresses.",
        "Others": "The Iron group's malware includes a patched version of Adblock Plus Chrome extension to inject crypto-mining and payment hijacking modules. It also uses the Everything search utility to find files likely to contain cryptocurrency wallets and monitors the clipboard for wallet addresses to hijack payments. The group's Pastebin account contains various scripts and payloads related to their operations. The Iron group is suspected to be Chinese, with most victims likely located in China."
