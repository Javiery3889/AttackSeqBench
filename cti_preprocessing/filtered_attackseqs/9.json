        "Initial Access": "The CTI report from September 18, 2017, authored by Edmund Brumaghin and others from Cisco's Talos Intelligence Group, details a supply chain attack where the download servers of the software vendor Avast were compromised to distribute a malicious version of CCleaner. The affected version, CCleaner 5.33, released on August 15, 2017, contained a multi-stage malware payload. The 32-bit CCleaner binary included in the installer had been modified to execute malicious code before proceeding with the normal CCleaner operations. This version was hosted on CCleaner's download server until September 11, 2017, and was signed with a valid certificate issued to Piriform Ltd by Symantec, valid through October 10, 2018. A second malicious sample was also discovered, signed approximately 15 minutes after the first one.",
        "Execution": "The malicious 32-bit CCleaner binary from the installer for version 5.33 was modified to call to the code at CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C), redirecting code execution flow to the malicious code. This initiated the decryption of data containing two stages of the malicious payload: a Position Independent Code (PIC) PE loader and a DLL file functioning as the malware payload. The malware author attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER. The binary created an executable heap, copied the decrypted malware to it, and then called the PE loader to begin its operation. After initiating the infection process, the binary erased the memory regions containing the PE loader and the DLL file, destroyed the heap, and continued with normal CCleaner operations.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware payload within CCleaner 5.33 attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature. The malicious DLL file, CBkdr.dll, was modified to avoid detection, and the DLLEntryPoint created an execution thread to return control to the loader. This thread was responsible for calling CCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall and setting up a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) chain to deallocate memory associated with the DLL and exit the thread.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware established a Command and Control (C2) channel by encrypting and encoding system information using modified Base64, then transmitting it via an HTTPS POST request to 216[.]126[.]225[.]148. The communications leveraged a hardcoded HTTP Host header set to speccy[.]piriform[.]com and ignored security errors from the server's self-signed SSL certificate. If no response was received from the C2 server, the malware fell back to a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). The malware stored the C2 IP address and the current system time plus two days in the registry at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Piriform\\Agomo:NID and HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Piriform\\Agomo:TCID, respectively.",
        "Impact": "The impact of the attack could be severe due to the high number of systems potentially affected. CCleaner claimed over 2 billion downloads worldwide as of November 2016. Affected systems needed to be restored to a state before August 15, 2017, or reinstalled, and users were advised to update to the latest version of CCleaner, which at the time of the report was version 5.34.",
        "Others": "The CTI report includes additional information about the investigation and response to the threat. Cisco Talos released ClamAV signatures 6336251 and 6336252 to detect the threat. Advanced Malware Protection (AMP), Cisco's Web Security Appliance (WSA), AMP Threat Grid, and Umbrella were recommended for protection against the threat. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) were provided, including file hashes, DGA domains, and IP addresses. The report also noted that antivirus detection for this threat was low at the time of writing."
