        "Initial Access": "Sofacy, a threat group, has been observed registering new domain names that closely resemble those of legitimate organizations. These domains are linked through shared WHOIS data and infrastructure, suggesting the preparation for a new phishing campaign. The domains mimic entities in various sectors, including international and European diplomatic institutions, web service providers, military institutions, contractors and conferences, energy companies, and news organizations in the US and Central Europe.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Sofacy attackers have employed phishing techniques to steal credentials, using obfuscated code to redirect users to malicious webpages. In some instances, they have disabled the malicious redirect, opting to send users to legitimate sites instead. They have created fake login pages for webmail and two-factor authentication platforms, requiring simultaneous login attempts by the attackers when victims are logging in. The phishing pages are designed to closely resemble the legitimate sites they are impersonating, making it difficult for users to detect the deception.",
        "Credential Access": "Sofacy has used phishing techniques to steal credentials, including setting up fake login pages for webmail and two-factor authentication platforms. The attackers have shown dedication by attempting to log in simultaneously with the victims. The phishing pages are crafted to look like legitimate sites, making it difficult for users to recognize the fraud.",
        "Others": "The CTI report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP dated 2014-10-22 details a phishing campaign by the threat group Sofacy. The campaign targets various sectors with fake domains and phishing pages. The report includes Snort signatures to detect potential Sofacy phishing redirects and advises on educating staff to identify suspicious emails. For further information and indicators of compromise, contact is provided via threatintelligence@uk.pwc.com. An extensive list of domains associated with the campaign is appended."
