        "Initial Access": "The Iranian APT group MuddyWater, also known as SeedWorm/Temp.Zagros, has been observed using two attack vectors to target governmental entities and the telecommunication sector. The first vector involves decoy documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft Office vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The second vector includes communication with compromised C2 servers to download files infected with macros. Notably, MuddyWater has not previously used CVE-2017-0199, which was associated with another Iranian group named OilRig.",
        "Command and Control": "MuddyWater's recent campaign has seen the use of compromised servers to host malicious code for the second stage of attacks. The group has been identified using servers in countries they target, such as a server in Pakistan (hxxp://corplink[.]com[.]pk/wp-content/themes/buisson/16433.jpg) and a server in China (hxxps://bbs[.]kafan[.]cn/thread-2150909-1-1.html). Additionally, a RAT file communicating with the IP address 185.244.149[.]218 was discovered, which sends encoded base64 output to the attacker about processes running on the compromised system.",
        "Others": "The MuddyWater group impersonates entities in countries surrounding Iran, including Kurdish groups, governmental actors in Iraq, Tajikistan, Pakistan, India, the UAE, and Cyprus. They have used documents resembling official documents from the regional government of Kurdistan and unofficial documents from countries surrounding Iran. The group's combined attack vector leverages CVE-2017-0199 and sends requests to a hacked server to download a JPG file containing a malicious macro. The documents used in the campaign can be categorized into two groups: those resembling previous documents used by MuddyWater and those written in English disguised as unofficial documents from countries surrounding Iran."
