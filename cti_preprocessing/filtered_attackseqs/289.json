Additionally, during the build process, the attacker can specify whether to include keylogging and USB infection functions.",
        "Command and Control": "XtremeRAT backdoors maintain and reference configuration data chosen by the attacker at the time they were built. This data can contain useful hints to help group attacks and attribute them to actors. The configuration data includes the name of the installed backdoor file, the directory under which the backdoor file is installed, which process it will inject into (if specified), CnC information, FTP information for sending stolen keystroke data to, mutex name of the master process, ID, and group name used by the actors for organizational purposes.",
        "Others": "The XtremeRAT was developed by 'xtremecoder' and has been available since at least 2010. Written in Delphi, the code of XtremeRAT is shared amongst several other Delphi RAT projects including SpyNet, CyberGate, and Cerberus. The RAT is available for free; however, the developer charges 350 Euros for the source code. The current version is Xtreme 3.6, with a variety of 'private' versions also available. The malware has been used in targeted attacks as well as traditional cybercrime. The majority of XtremeRAT activity is associated with spam campaigns that typically distribute Zeus variants and other banking-focused malware. Operation Molerats in 2012 used XtremeRAT against various governments as well as Israeli and Palestinian targets. FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) cloud examined 165 XtremeRAT samples from attacks that primarily hit the Energy, utilities, petroleum refining, Financial Services, and High-tech sectors. Among these, 4 samples were used in targeted attacks against the High-Tech sector by threat actors called 'MoleRats'. The malware is being spammed out with file names such as 'Certificaciones De Pagos Nominas Parafiscales jpg 125420215 58644745574455 .exe' and 'Soportes de pagos certificaciones y documentos mes mayo 30 2013567888885432235678888888123456.exe'. The sinkhole analysis of 'uranio2.no-ip.biz' showed 12000 unique IPs connected to the CnC server, with the majority of connections from Colombia."
