        "Initial Access": "On July 8, 2015, Unit 42 identified a spear-phishing attack targeting the US Government, exploiting an Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) from the Hacking Team data breach. The attack involved a link to a Flash exploit hosted on rpt.perrydale[.]com and report.perrydale[.]com, both resolving to a Ukrainian IP 194.44.130.179, likely through DNS hijacking. The exploit, found at rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf and report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf, retrieved a secondary payload, b.gif, from the same domains.",
        "Execution": "The Flash exploit, named 'show.swf', contained ActionScript designed to execute shellcode for installing a payload. The ActionScript classes involved were MainClass.as, MyClass.as, MyClass1.as, MyClass2.as, MyUtils.as, and ShellWin32.as. The 'TryExpl' function within MyClass.as created a use-after-free condition to exploit CVE-2015-5119. Shared functions with a previous UPS attack exploiting CVE-2015-3113 were also observed, including data type manipulation, logging, and decrypting shellcode.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malicious Flash file 'show.swf' attempted to exploit the vulnerability and execute shellcode to install a payload, with the payload embedded in an animated GIF image, 'b.gif'. However, the payload was not weaponized as it lacked an encrypted payload, possibly due to UPS's tactic of serving payloads only within limited time windows and to specific victim profiles.",
        "Others": "The attack shares similarities with a previous targeted attack attributed to the APT group known as UPS or APT3, using a Flash exploit leveraging CVE-2015-3113. The ActionScript classes and log messages in the malicious Flash files indicate attribution to UPS. The payload extraction and decryption technique from an animated GIF image was also used in the CVE-2015-3113 attacks. The shellcodes for CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-3113 were found to be 99% similar. The attacks demonstrate how APT groups like UPS quickly leverage new vulnerabilities. SHA256 for the Flash exploit: a2fe113cc13acac2bb79a375f692b8ba5cc2fa880272adc7ab0d01f839e877ff. Domains involved: rpt.perrydale[.]com, report.perrydale[.]com, and IP 194.44.130.179."
