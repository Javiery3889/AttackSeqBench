        "Initial Access": "The infamous Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Poison Ivy (PIVY) has been observed targeting various Asian countries. A new variant, SPIVY, uses DLL sideloading and operates differently from a variant active for at least the past 12 months. The PIVY variant drops a decoy document, a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll, and the PIVY shellcode file as Active.dat in a directory named ActiveUpdate_[0-9]{3}. It copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe, executes the new file with the path to the DLL, and installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.",
        "Execution": "The PIVY variant copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and then executes the new file with the path to the DLL to perform its malicious actions. This deployment tactic has been used previously with different executable names for the rundll32 copy and the base directory name.",
        "Persistence": "The PIVY variant installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading to load the dropped DLL and perform its malicious actions. The malware's configuration has been modified to confuse some publicly available tools that parse the configuration data. The C2s are no longer null-padded, and each hostname ends with a null-byte followed by a string that changes slightly with each Command & Control (C2) server.",
        "Command and Control": "The PIVY samples communicate with C2 servers such as webserver.servehttp[.]com and admin.nslookupdns[.]com. The IP resolved to by these hostnames overlapped with fileshare.serveftp[.]com, which was used in an earlier PIVY sample. The C2s are no longer null-padded, and each hostname ends with a null-byte followed by a string that changes slightly with each C2 server.",
        "Others": "PIVY samples were observed targeting Myanmar and several other countries in Asia. The exact targets and delivery methods are not known, but the documents and submission sources provide strong hints as to the motivations and potential targets of these exploitation campaigns. The targeting of post-election Myanmar appears to be following the same style as what was mentioned in the \"Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger\" paper by ASERT. A possible connection exists given that the C2 for these samples resolved to an IP contained within 103.240.203.0/22, as did a 9002 RAT sample in the Seven Pointed Dagger exploitation campaign. A \"LURK0\" Gh0strat and another PIVY domain were also observed to have resolved to IPs contained within this range, making this subnet more suspicious from a targeted attack perspective."
