The attack exploited the update mechanism of NoxPlayer, an Android emulator used worldwide. The campaign, named Operation NightScout, potentially affected many users in Vietnam. The report focuses on a sample with SHA-1 hash E45A5D9B03CFBE7EB2E90181756FDF0DD690C00C, identified as UpdatePackageSilence.exe, which serves as the first stage in the infection chain. The sample exhibits similar coding, execution, and behavior to VVSup.exe, previously mentioned in VinCSS's blog posts.",
        "Execution": "The report describes the execution of a malicious MFC Dialog application, compiled with Visual Studio 2008, which uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory. This process initiates a series of fileless PE loads. The application's execution flow is altered to hide the dialog, avoid showing on the Windows Taskbar, and simulate user interaction.",

        "Defense Evasion": "The report indicates defense evasion techniques, such as manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions to avoid detection by AV/EDR solutions that hook kernel32.dll. The malware also uses a custom LZMA compression algorithm to unpack embedded data, making static analysis more challenging.",

        "Exfiltration": "None",

        "Others": "The report mentions the discovery of a new RAT named ElephantRAT (Kunming version) and its similarities with the Smanager RAT. The malware creates a directory with hidden and system attributes, unpacks additional files, and checks for write permissions to the System32 directory. It also uses rundll32.exe to load a DLL with the parameter 'ByPassUAC' and creates a batch file to delete the parent executable and itself. The report also notes a programming error in the ManualLoadDll function, where malloc is incorrectly used, leading to potential memory issues."
