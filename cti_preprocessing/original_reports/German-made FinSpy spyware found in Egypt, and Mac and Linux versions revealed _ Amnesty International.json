The report detailed the discovery of new samples of FinSpy for Windows, Android, and previously undisclosed versions for Linux and MacOS. The report aims to aid cybersecurity research and raise awareness among HRDs about evolving digital attack techniques. The report also revealed that the NilePhish attacker group, likely state-sponsored, has been involved in distributing FinSpy and testing Cobalt Strike, a penetration testing suite. The report includes technical analysis of the FinSpy samples, their capabilities, and the infection chain for MacOS and Linux versions. Additionally, the report provides indicators of compromise and acknowledges contributions from Esther Onfroy and Maciek Kotowicz."
