The authors discuss the challenges of syntactic, semantic, and contextual problems in command-line analysis and propose the IR-on-MAN system, which leverages a command-line specialized embedding model called CmdGPT and association mining techniques to interpret and inspect incidents. The system aims to provide strong interpretability by mining significant tokens directly in the feature space, without relying on manual rule development or regular expressions. The authors highlight the limitations of traditional mining algorithms and demonstrate how IR-on-MAN can effectively identify significant tokens, even with slight variations in command lines. The system's performance is evaluated through experiments, showing high recall and precision rates in detecting malicious command lines. The article also emphasizes the importance of domain knowledge in applying large language models to specific fields like cybersecurity and suggests potential applications such as command line correlation and smart search. A demo site for IR-on-MAN is available for users to try the system and export command lines and their tokens to Sigma rules."
