The campaign involved strategic web compromises, where the attackers modified legitimate websites to inject malicious scripts. The campaign went quiet after July 2021, possibly due to the threat actors retooling after publications by Citizen Lab, Google, and Microsoft detailed Candiru's activities. A comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples is available on GitHub."
