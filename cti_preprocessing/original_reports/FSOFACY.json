        "Initial Access": "APT28, also known as Sofacy, Sednit, and Sourface, has been observed targeting financial markets and is suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence services. The group has been known for its ability to infiltrate networks and remain undetected for extended periods. In late April and early May of 2015, cybersecurity experts at root9B identified suspicious activity within a client's network that bore the signature of APT28. They discovered a global attack in preparation, involving spearphishing domains impersonating financial institutions, and took steps to protect identified victims. The report documents the discovery and reporting of Sofacy zero-day malware before the attack could begin, including previously unknown malware indicators and hashes.",

Analysts at root9B observed the migration of fake domains to other servers, which allowed them to conduct further analysis and identify common tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the adversaries. The discovery of a single mistake in the hacker's tradecraft led to a treasure trove of new indicators, including evidence related to past attacks against targets such as the Commercial Bank International. The analysis revealed a detailed view of the specific tactics employed by the adversary and a plan for a larger hack than originally believed.",

        "Others": "APT28, known for its large-scale attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in software like Microsoft Windows, Adobe Acrobat, and Microsoft Excel, has targeted NATO, defense industry corporations, government domains, and financial institutions, causing significant financial damage. The group's activities have sparked debate over whether it is criminal in nature or an agent of a nation-state, with most cybersecurity analysts concluding an undeniable affiliation with the Russian government. The root9B report details the discovery of APT28's preparations for an attack on financial markets, including the creation of spearphishing domains and the registration of fake domains resembling financial institutions. The report also highlights the identification of zero-day threats and their corresponding hashes, as well as the adversary's flawed tradecraft, which allowed for a breakthrough in the analysis. The report concludes with a warning of potential spear-phishing attacks against financial institutions and recommends blocking communications with identified Command and Control servers."
