Location: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014-June 2015e Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet Explorer web browser Role in infrastructure: Support email communications and other IT services used in business operations. Exploitation method: Adversaries send targeted emails containing the modified MS Office files as attachments to users on targeted networks. Impact: RAT is delivered to targeted network, but not installed. Installation requires employees to actively grant permission to the embedded VBA scripts to execute.",

Exploitation method: In a social engineering attack, employees are prompted to enable macros when opening the file attached to phishing email. Once macros are enabled, the VBA script places multiple malicious files on the workstation, unbeknown to the employee. Impact: Files placed on workstations within the corporate network can begin the communication process with external Command and Control (CC) servers.",

Location: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity, malware execution Timeline: June 2015-December 2015 Device/application: Windows OS workstations, Windows domain controllers, virtual private network (VPN) service deployed in control environment Role in infrastructure: These systems support business operations, manage permissions and domain access, and provide remote network access respectively. Exploitation method: Adversaries use delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins to gather stored credentials or log keystrokes. After gathering valid credentials for user with administrator privileges, adversaries use the stolen administrator credentials to access the domain controller, recover additional credentials, and create new privileged accounts. Impact: Adversaries obtain valid credentials enabling them to expand access across the corporate network and into the control environment, ensure persistent access, and blend into regular network traffic.",
        "Discovery": "Step 8: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on Corporate Network Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on corporate network to discover potential targets and expand accessed. Location: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity, malware execution Timeline: June 2015-December 2015 Device/application: Discovered systems, including networked uninterruptable power supply (UPS) devices, data center servers, a telephone communications server, and employee workstations Role in infrastructure: Internal reconnaissance efforts could potentially include all deployed devices on the corporate network. Exploitation method: Adversaries likely use a combination of valid user credentials and BlackEnergy 3 plugins developed to conduct network discovery. VS.dll plugin is likely used to leverage MS Sysinternals PsExec to establish remote connections to workstations and servers. Impact: Adversaries can enumerate the systems deployed across the network, identify targets, and begin preparations for final attack. Step 9: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network Adversaries use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed systems. Location: ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015-December 2015 Device/application: Discovered systems, including human machine interface (HMI) workstations, distributed management system (DMS) servers, UPS devices, 52 serial-to-Ethernet converters (Moxa UC 7408-LX-Plus, 53 IRZRUH2 3G54), remote terminal unit (RTU) devices (ABB RTU560 CMU-02), and the substation breakers Role in infrastructure: HMI workstations provide a graphical user interface for operators to remotely monitor and control devices within the control environment. DMS applications enable centralized monitoring and issuing of commands within a control environment. UPS devices condition incoming power to downstream devices and provide temporary battery backup power. Serial-to-Ethernet converters convert serial data from field devices to digital packets, enabling communications with the control center. RTU devices function as a communication processor or a data concentrator in a substation, enabling communications and data transfer between field devices in the substations and the control center. Substation breakers are devices designed to physically interrupt current flows through an electrical circuit. Exploitation method: Adversaries use valid credentials to interact directly with the client application for the DMS server via a VPN, and native remote access services to access employee workstations hosting HMI applications. This access likely enables adversaries to enumerate all networked devices within the control environment. Impact: Adversaries gain access to critical systems, enabling them to begin target selection and preparations for final attack.",

Location: Corporate network Action: Malware execution Timeline: May 2014-June 2015 Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet Explorer web browser Role in infrastructure: Support email communications and other services used in business operations. Exploitation method: The external connection is established as part of the execution routine following installation of the malicious files. Once permissions to execute macros are granted by employees, the malicious VBA script installs the malware implant, and the implant attempts to communicate with an external server via HTTP requests. Impact: Adversaries gain unauthorized access to targeted networks, including the ability to deliver additional BlackEnergy plugins to enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "Step 10: Develop Malicious Computer Code. Adversaries develop malicious computer code update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters. Location: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015-December 2015 Device/application: Activity conducted external to network Role in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network Exploitation method: After identifying deployed converts, adversaries begin a malware development and testing effort on infrastructure outside of the targeted network. Impact: Upon completion of this step, adversaries would have target-specific malware designed to disrupt communications with field devices by disabling deployed converters. Step 11: Deliver Data Destruction Malware. Adversaries likely deliver KillDisk malware to a network share and set policy on the domain controller to retrieve malware and execute upon system reboot. Location: Corporate and ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: December 2015, directly preceding attack Device/application: Network share and Windows domain controller server Role in infrastructure: The network share provides access to shared digital resources, and the Windows domain controller manages access control throughout the network. Exploitation method: Adversaries likely use stolen credentials to place KillDisk malware on a network share, then set the retrieval and execution of the malicious files by implementing a policy on the compromised domain controller server. Impact: Prescheduling execution of malware enables coordination of multiple attack components, such that data destruction coincides with or shortly follows attacks against breakers. Step 12: Schedule Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Disruption. Adversaries schedule unauthorized outage of UPS for telephone communication server and data center servers. Location: Corporate and ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: Directly preceding December 2015 attack Device/application: Networked UPS devices with remote management interface Role in infrastructure: Prevent power outages from disrupting continuous operation of critical systems. Exploitation method: Adversaries likely use valid credentials to access privileged employee accounts, then use this access to remotely schedule unauthorized power outages. Impact: Prescheduling outages enables coordination of multiple attack components, such that critical systems also go down because of the power outages, stifling potential restoration efforts. Step 13: Trip Breakers. Adversaries use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and disrupt power distribution to over 225,000 customers within three distribution areas. Location: ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: December 23, 2015, during Device/application: HMI workstations, DMS servers, RTU, and the substation breakers Role in infrastructure: HMI workstations provide a graphical user interface for operators to remotely monitor and control devices within the control environment. DMS applications enable centralized monitoring and issuing of commands within a control environment. Substation breakers are devices designed to physically interrupt current flows through an electrical circuit. Exploitation method: Adversaries use valid credentials to seize control of operator workstations, access DMS client application via VPN, and issue unauthorized commands to breakers at substations. Impact: Opening of breakers results in disruption of electricity service to customers. Step 14: Sever Connection to Field Devices. After opening the breakers, adversaries deliver malicious computer code update to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices. The malicious updates render the converters inoperable, and sever connections between the control center and the substations. Location: ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: December 23, 2015, during attack Device/application: Serial-to-Ethernet converters (Moxa UC 7408-LX-Plus,55 IRZRUH2 3G56) Role in infrastructure: Convert serial data from field devices to digital packets to be transmitted to remote monitoring and administration systems within the control network. Exploitation method: Adversaries use network access to push the malicious update over the network to targeted devices. Impact: Operators are unable to remotely close the breakers, requiring workers to manually close breakers at each substation. Forcing this manual response draws out recovery time Step 15: Telephony Denial-of-Service Attack. Adversaries initiate DoS attack on telephone call center at one of the targeted distributors. Location: Corporate network Action: Likely automated process Timeline: Dec 23, 2015, during attack Device/application: Operator telephone call center Role in infrastructure: Receive external telephone communications from customers. Exploitation method: Adversaries likely use automated IP-based call generators to flood the targeted call center. Impact: Automated calls overwhelm resources at call center, blocking legitimate communications from customers. Step 16: Disable Critical Systems via UPS Outage. Previously scheduled UPS outage cuts power to targeted telephone communications server and data center servers. Location: Corporate and ICS network Action: Execution of prescheduled process Timeline: December 23, 2015, during attack Device/application: Networked UPS devices with remote management interface, telephone communications server, and data center servers Role in infrastructure: Prevent power outages from disrupting continuous operation of critical systems. Exploitation method: Adversaries use network access to schedule the temporary backup power to be offline at the time of the power outages. Impact: Power loss to telephone server disrupts communications across remote sites, and disruptions at control centers inhibit ability to monitor and respond to attack against breakers. The disruption at the data center and associated system reboot trigger execution of KillDisk malware. Step 17: Destroy Critical System Data. Scheduled execution of KillDisk malware erases the master boot records and deletes system log data on targeted machines across the victims' corporate and ICS network. Location: Corporate network and ICS network Action: Malware execution Timeline: December 23, 2015, during attack Device/application: RTU device (ABB RTU560 CMU-02),57 servers and workstations used by management, human resources (HR), and finance staff Role in infrastructure: The RTU functions as a communication processor or data concentrator in a substation, enabling communications and data transfer between field devices in the substations and the control center.58 Servers and workstations are used by management, HR, and finance staff to conduct business administration operations. Exploitation method: Malware is retrieved from the network share and executed on networked devices according to direction received via domain controller policy or local Windows Task Scheduler. Impact: Targeted systems are rendered inoperable, and critical data is destroyed.",
