These executables were loaded into system processes via process hollowing, targeting legitimate system processes such as msiexec.exe, unzip.exe, rundll32.exe, schtasks.exe, and powershell.exe, and later svchost.exe, tracert.exe, and setup.exe.",
        "Persistence": "Dexphot ensured persistence through dual monitoring services that checked the status of all three malicious processes and re-infected the device if any were terminated. It also used schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection, employing techniques like Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution. The tasks called msiexec.exe as a proxy to run the malicious code and updated Dexphot's components upon system reboot and every 90 or 110 minutes while the system was running.",

It also used fileless techniques and process hollowing to hide malicious code within legitimate system processes, making detection and remediation difficult.",

The team's insights into the goals and motivations of Dexphot's authors contributed to a broader understanding of cybercriminal behavior."
