This malware was delivered via a malicious document disguised as a Curriculum Vitae, likely as part of a phishing campaign. The malware, once executed, made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.",

Further analysis using the Augury Malware addon identified eight additional malware samples using the same C2.

Five additional C2 domains were identified: escanor[.]live, jaime-martinez[.]info, krasil-anthony[.]icu, nicoledotson[.]icu, and ruthgreenrtg[.]live. Pivoting on ImpHash values and the AV signature Win32/Revokery.J led to the discovery of five more associated samples and two more C2 domains: benyallen[.]club and chad-jessie[.]info. A user agent string resembling Googlebot was used as another pivot, identifying approximately 600 samples and four more samples with a distinctive URL pattern. This led to the identification of five more C2 domains: jack-fruit[.]club, lordblackwood[.]club, angeladeloney[.]info, overingtonray[.]info, and camilleoconnell[.]website. In total, 40 malware samples were identified, communicating with 13 C2 domains.",
