The email lured officials by asking them to download an MS Excel sheet named 'amended training schedule of IFS officers'. The download link provided in the email appeared to be from 'https://www.mea.gov.in/ifs-training.schedule', but it actually pointed to a malicious XLS document from the URL 'http://info-sharing.net/?a=1533541533'.",
        "Execution": "The malicious document contained macro code which executed to drop the first payload, a Crimson RAT downloader. This payload then downloaded a fully functional Crimson RAT from the IP address 151.106.19[.]207:8246.",

        "Others": "A document with similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) was identified in early August with the name 'MoFA-MoDAfghanistan.xls', uploaded on 3rd August 2018. The XLS file contained malicious macro code, which upon execution, downloaded a payload from the URL 'http://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll'. In 2016, Proofpoint published a report on 'Operation Transparent Tribe', detailing various attacks against Indian Embassies using Crimson RAT. One of the campaigns fetched a payload from the same URL as found in the second campaign 'http://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll'. This suggests that the APT group behind Operation Transparent Tribe is active and targeting Indian officials again. The conclusion is that there is a high probability that the APT group behind 'Operation Transparent Tribe' might be active and is targeting Indian organizations again. Indicators of Compromise include various hashes and IP addresses: 58d52690179c2467fce76cec126ec5bb915f32d66955de954bd89e3110d6a03e0f0f6f48c3ee5f8e7cd3697c40002bc76b4635023eb1372df9b7618a5dae6128, 151.106.19.207:8246, 151.106.19.207:3286, 151.106.19.207:12621, and 'http://info-sharing.net/?a=1533541533'."
