        "Command and Control": "The Threat Research Team at Fidelis Cybersecurity has observed active infections of the H-W0rm Remote Access Trojan (RAT) across various enterprise verticals and geographies. The malware, also known as Hworm, is not a typical worm but exhibits classic RAT capabilities, allowing adversaries to fully control infected systems. Capabilities include collecting system information, file management, remote desktop capture, keylogging, collecting passwords from web browsers, accessing webcams and microphones, running remote applications or scripts, updating the RAT, closing connections, and uninstalling the RAT. Artifacts have linked Hworm C2 domains with other RATs such as njRAT, XtremeRAT, and DarkComet. A list of C2 domains active in the past six months has been provided, with notable domains including 'njrat2012.no-ip[dot]biz' which was associated with Xtreme RAT activity and njRAT beaconing. Fidelis Barncat is being enriched with newer Hworm configurations to aid the security community.",

They have also shared Yara rules for detecting the VBS and PE versions of H-W0rm. Speculation in the research community suggests that 'Houdini' (aka 'Mohamed Benabdellah') may have connections with 'njq8' (aka 'Naser Al Mutairi'), the initial developer of 'njRAT' and 'njw0rm', and that there may be collaboration between RAT developers. Some versions of Hworm's network traffic contain information about the antivirus tool installed on the victim system, indicating that infected systems were running antivirus tools like Microsoft Security Essentials, Symantec Endpoint Protection, McAfee VirusScan Enterprise, ESET Smart Security, and Windows Defender, which did not remove the malware for unknown reasons."
