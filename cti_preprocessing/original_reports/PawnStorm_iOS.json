When we try to terminate it by killing the process, it will restart almost immediately.\n\nInstalling the malware into an iOS 8 device yields different results. The icon is not hidden and it also cannot restart automatically. This suggests that the malware was designed prior to the release of iOS 8 last September 2014.",

Error messages tend to be in red, while others are in green as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe full uniform resource identifier (URI) for C&C HTTP requests is randomly generated, according to a template agreed upon with the C&C server. The base URI can be seen in Figure 4, and parameters are chosen from the list below and appended to the base URI.\n\nThe malware uses a token to identify which module is communicating. The token is Base64 encoded data, but padded with a 5-byte random prefix so that it looks like valid Base64 data. See the first line \"ai=\" part in the figure below.\n\nReverse engineering also revealed additional communication functions.\n\nThe app is also able to upload files via FTP protocol.",
