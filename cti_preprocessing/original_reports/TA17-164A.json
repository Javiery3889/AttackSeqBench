The report identifies IP addresses linked to systems infected with DeltaCharlie malware and provides descriptions of the malware and associated malware signatures. DHS and FBI are distributing these IP addresses to enable network defense activities and reduce exposure to the DDoS command-and-control network. FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using the IP addresses for further network exploitation. DeltaCharlie is a DDoS tool used by HIDDEN COBRA actors, capable of launching DNS attacks, NTP attacks, and Character Generation Protocol attacks. It operates as a svchost-based service on victims' systems, capable of downloading executables, changing its configuration, updating binaries, terminating processes, and activating and terminating DDoS attacks.",

The malware variant known as DeltaCharlie is used to manage North Korea's DDoS botnet infrastructure. The alert contains indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware descriptions, network signatures, and host-based rules to help network defenders detect activity conducted by the North Korean government. HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and compromise a range of victims, resulting in data exfiltration and disruptive activities. They commonly target systems running older, unsupported versions of Microsoft operating systems and have used Adobe Flash player vulnerabilities for initial entry. The alert includes technical indicators related to specific North Korean government cyber operations and provides suggested response actions, recommended mitigation techniques, and information on reporting incidents to the U.S. Government. The report also includes mitigation strategies and recommendations for network administrators to prevent cyber intrusions."
