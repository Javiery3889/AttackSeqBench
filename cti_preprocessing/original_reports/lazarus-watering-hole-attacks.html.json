The website code had been altered from at least 2016-10-07 to late January to download malicious JavaScript files from compromised domains sap.misapor[.]ch and eye-watch[.]in, leading to malware downloads on visitors' devices.",
        "Execution": "The malware, identified by the MD5 hash 85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b and named gpsvc.exe, is a Win32 executable first seen on 2017-01-26. It is packed with 'Enigma Protector' and drops a known Lazarus group malware variant. The executable accepts command line arguments to list service names, open or set events, and drop/install DLLs under specified service names using an RC4 password derived from the provided password's MD5 hash.",
        "Persistence": "None",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware uses a commercial packer known as 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion. Additionally, the malware executes a series of basic system information gathering commands and returns the results via the C&C, eye-watch[.]in, which may also serve as a defense evasion technique by mimicking normal system queries.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "The malware executes a series of commands to gather system information, including hostname, user information, system version, network configuration, active TCP connections, and more. The results are sent back to the C&C, eye-watch[.]in.",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "None",
        "Command and Control": "The C&C servers for the malware are identified by the IP addresses 125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218. The malware communicates with the C&C using a beacon with the User-Agent resembling a Firefox browser on Windows.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "Additional watering-hole attacks were observed on the Comisi\\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (Mexico) and a state-owned bank in Uruguay. The eye-watch[.]in domain was used in these attacks and has been associated with other malicious activities, including the delivery of malware variants and a Silverlight exploit based on CVE-2016-0034. A list of 255 IP address strings was found in the exploit kit website code, likely used to filter traffic and deliver exploits only to specific subnets, primarily targeting financial institutions in Poland and Mexico."
