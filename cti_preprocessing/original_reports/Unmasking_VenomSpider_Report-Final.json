TRU has uncovered extensive personal information about badbullzvenom, including his real name, address, and social media accounts. The report also details the progression of badbullzvenom from a script kiddie to a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) provider and the ongoing development and sale of the Golden Chickens malware suite.
