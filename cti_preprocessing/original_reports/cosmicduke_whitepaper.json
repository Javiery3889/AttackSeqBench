        "Initial Access": "CosmicDuke infections begin by deceiving victims into opening a PDF file containing an exploit or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image file. The attackers utilize social engineering and document-based exploits to achieve this. The document-based exploit involves a malicious Flash object embedded in a PDF file that exploits the CVE-2011-0611 vulnerability in Adobe Flash, Reader, and Acrobat products. Social engineering tactics involve disguising the executable file as an image or document and displaying a decoy document or image to distract the user while the malware installs silently in the background.",
        "Execution": "The CosmicDuke samples analyzed use the same loader as MiniDuke's stage 3 samples. This loader was first seen with a compilation date of March 24, 2011, predating the oldest documented MiniDuke sample. The most common compilation date for loaders that load the Cosmu malware is November 13, 2012. The MiniDuke loader was updated, and CosmicDuke samples began using the updated loader in mid-April 2014, a few months after MiniDuke started using it in mid-December 2013.",
        "Persistence": "CosmicDuke achieves persistence on the system by creating a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installing a Windows service with the name 'javamtsup' and the display name 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.' The service binary's size on disk varies, but typically the real size is 5120 bytes. The service opens a handle to the explorer.exe process, duplicates its process token, reads the path of the actual malware binary from the registry, and starts the malware using the duplicated token. The malware copies itself to %WINDIR%\\system32 with various filenames generated by combining two items from a predefined list.",

It also steals Windows credentials such as LM and NT hashes, cached domain passwords, LSA secrets, and plain text keys for WLANs. Additionally, it exports certificates and associated private keys from the system store using the password 'saribas' to encrypt the exported data.",
        "Discovery": "CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including various document, archive, and other file types.

The configuration, which includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.",
