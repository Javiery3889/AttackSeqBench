It emphasizes the need for organizations to develop 'white blood cells' of their own, which are capabilities to proactively hunt and neutralize threats. The report outlines various indicators of compromise (IOCs) and indicators of attack (IOAs) that threat hunters should monitor. These indicators serve as signals of compromised activity and can reveal imminent or successful threats. The report also presents a series of threat hunting scenarios, each associated with a specific tactic and MITRE reference. These scenarios provide hypotheses and SQL queries to assist SOC analysts in identifying potential breaches on their network. Additionally, the report mentions the use of RANK Software's VASA platform, which integrates machine learning and artificial intelligence to aggregate data sources into a single platform, enhancing the effectiveness of security analysts in real-time threat hunting. The report concludes with a summary chart of IOCs and an invitation to learn more about RANK Software's solutions for improving enterprise security posture."
