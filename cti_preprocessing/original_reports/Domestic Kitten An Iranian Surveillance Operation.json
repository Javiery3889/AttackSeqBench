        "Initial Access": "Recent investigations by Check Point researchers have uncovered an extensive and targeted surveillance operation, dubbed 'Domestic Kitten,' which has been active since 2016. The attackers entice victims to download mobile applications loaded with spyware by using fake decoy content. These applications include an ISIS branded wallpaper changer, updates from the ANF Kurdistan news agency, and a fake version of the messaging app Vidogram. The applications are designed to appeal to Kurdish and Turkish natives, ISIS supporters, and Iranian citizens. The attackers use these applications to collect sensitive information from the victims' mobile devices.",

This includes contact lists, phone call records, SMS messages, browser history and bookmarks, geo-location, photos, and surrounding voice recordings. The stolen data is sent back to the attackers' command and control (C&C) servers using HTTP POST requests.",
        "Command and Control": "The attackers' infrastructure includes C&C servers that receive stolen data from the compromised devices. One of the applications contacts a domain, firmwaresystemupdate[.]com, which initially resolved to an Iranian IP address before switching to a Russian one. Other applications contact IP addresses directly, which are newly registered domains following a first name-surname naming convention, such as Stevenwentz[.]com, Ronaldlubbers[.]site, and Georgethompson[.]space. Each victim is assigned a unique device UUID, which is used to identify the logs sent back to the attackers.",

        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The operation 'Domestic Kitten' has affected around 240 users, with over 97% of the victims being Iranian citizens. The campaign also targets individuals from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Great Britain. The attackers meticulously document the campaign, including the name of the malicious application used and an Application Code Name field for quick recognition. The number of people affected is much higher than the number of direct victims, as the attackers also harvest the full contact list from each victim's mobile device, and record phone calls and SMS details, compromising the private information of thousands of unrelated users. Check Point's Mobile solutions, such as Sand Blast Mobile and Zone Alarm Mobile, can protect against such attacks. Indicators of Compromise include several hashes and IP addresses associated with the campaign."
