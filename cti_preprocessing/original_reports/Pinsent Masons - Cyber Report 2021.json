        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report indicates that phishing emails have been a common attack vector, with a noted shift towards malware propagation leading to ransomware attacks. There has been a decrease in incidents caused by lost devices, reflecting the impact of lockdown and travel restrictions. Vulnerabilities in VPNs and remote desktop protocols have been more readily exploited due to remote working. The report also mentions third-party/supply chain issues, highlighting the Solar Winds and Kaseya cyber-attacks where malware was inserted into software updates, creating backdoors for further attacks. Additionally, the report discusses the importance of good logging processes to understand the point of intrusion and impacted data, despite sophisticated threat actors' anti-forensic efforts to erase logs.",

        "Initial Access": "The CTI report discusses the use of phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion for various cyber attacks, including further phishing campaigns and payment diversion fraud attempts. Attackers have used sophisticated methods, such as sending phishing emails from genuine accounts within a client's supply chain. The report emphasizes the importance of multi-factor authentication, robust backups, and network segregation to protect against lateral movement by attackers.",

The report notes that the ICO has seen an increase in reported ransomware cases and emphasizes the importance of having policies and procedures in place to respond to attacks.",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The CTI report discusses the increase in data subject litigation following cyber incidents, with a focus on the UK Supreme Court decision in Lloyd v Google, which may influence the risk of mass actions. It also mentions the importance of being prepared for a cyber-attack, including having incident response and business recovery plans. The report highlights the global increase in ransomware attacks and the potential legal implications of making ransom payments, particularly in relation to OFAC advisories in the US. Additionally, the report covers the rise of data subject claims in the UK and the potential impact of the EU Collective Redress Directive on mass actions across Europe."
