The malware is installed as a service DLL and consists of two files: a loader and an encrypted second file which is the main RAT. The loader, upon execution, decrypts and runs the RAT in memory. The report includes the submission of four files, two of which are identified as loaders (ml.dll and rasautoex.dll) and two as versions of the TAIDOOR RAT (svchost.dll). The loaders decrypt and execute the RAT files, which then attempt to connect to command-and-control (C2) servers. The report provides detailed technical information, including file hashes, antivirus detections, and YARA rules for detection.",

The malware communicates over port 443 TCP, but the initial packet sent does not follow TLS protocol and is easily identifiable. The report includes WHOIS information for the domains and details the communication process between the RAT and the C2 servers.",

It also includes Snort rules for detecting malicious traffic associated with the malware and recommends maintaining situational awareness of the latest threats. Additionally, the report contains contact information for CISA and instructions for submitting malware samples or reporting suspicious activity."
