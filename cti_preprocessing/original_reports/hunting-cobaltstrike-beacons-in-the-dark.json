The report outlines a robust CTI lifecycle for an XDR world, detailing phases such as planning & direction, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, and evaluation & feedback. The authors discuss the importance of narrowing broad questions into specific, closed-loop questions for various XDR stakeholders to proactively defend against Cobalt Strike. The collection phase emphasizes crafting queries based on Cobalt Strike's characteristics to discover active Team Server Infrastructure, while the processing phase involves extracting configuration data from Cobalt Strike Beacons. The analysis phase leverages insights, trends, and discoveries to enhance detection and correlation capabilities across XDR solutions. The report also highlights the significance of 'hidden watermarks' in Beacon configurations for tracking Team Server operators. The dissemination phase addresses how the enriched dataset can be utilized by SOC analysts, incident responders, forensic analysts, and data scientists. The report concludes with a debrief that reassesses the CTI questions and the steps undertaken throughout the lifecycle, recapping the insights and trends uncovered. The report underscores the evolving intelligence paradigm in XDR and the potential for machine-based decision-making in response to incidents."
