The group is likely after intellectual property or insights into the targeted sectors. McAfee Labs and the Advanced Threat Research team have uncovered related attacks targeting the pharmaceutical, financial, and accounting industries. The campaign has links to earlier attacks, with code reuse from the 2013 TeamSpy campaign and similarities to the BlackEnergy malware. McAfee Labs thanks Intezer for their assistance during the research."
