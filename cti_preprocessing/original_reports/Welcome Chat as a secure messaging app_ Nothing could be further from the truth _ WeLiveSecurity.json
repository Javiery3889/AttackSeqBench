It was never available on the official Android app store and requires permissions that are intrusive but may seem natural for a messaging app. The app's infrastructure was not built with security in mind, leaving harvested data from victims freely available on the internet via an unsecured server. The malicious code in the app appears to be copied from publicly available open-source projects and code snippets. The espionage app is believed to be developed by the attackers rather than being a trojanized version of a legitimate app. The campaign is linked to the threat actors behind the long-term BadPatch campaign. ESET researchers recommend not installing apps from outside the official Google Play store and to be cautious of app permissions."
