The attackers collected information on their targets prior to phishing attacks, tailoring their approach based on the target's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.",
        "Resource Development": "None",
        "Initial Access": "The campaign utilized phishing attacks through unknown email or social media accounts and compromised accounts of public figures. The attackers sent fake security alerts from email addresses like notifications.mailservices@gmail[.]com, and noreply.customermails@gmail[.]com, claiming unauthorized access attempts. They also used Google Site to create fake Google Drive download pages to trick users into entering their credentials.",
        "Execution": "None",

        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems. They also used third-party services like Firefox Screenshot to host these images. Additionally, a hidden tracking image was used in emails to alert the attackers when a target opened the email.",
        "Credential Access": "The phishing pages were designed for both desktop and mobile versions of Google and Yahoo! mail services. The attackers verified the victims' credentials in real-time and, if correct, prompted for the 2-step verification code, allowing them to bypass even two-factor authentication methods.",

Technical reviews indicated that the attackers used VPNs and proxies with Dutch and French IP addresses but were traced back to real Iranian IP addresses during the preparation phase. The campaign's timing, methods, and targets suggest it is linked to the Charming Kitten group, known for its connections to the Iranian government. The campaign coincides with the U.S. imposing new sanctions on Iran on November 4, 2018, and aims to infiltrate accounts of individuals working on sanctions against Iran."
