Recent attacks and alleged subsequent leaks of stolen information from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) have highlighted the unprecedented impact of Russian threat actors in the 2016 United States Presidential election. In June 2016, Crowdstrike identified APT28 and APT29's presence in the DNC's computer systems. APT28 gained access in April 2016, while APT29 gained access in summer 2015."
