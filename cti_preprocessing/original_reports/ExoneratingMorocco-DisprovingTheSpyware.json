Concerns are raised about the lack of independent verification and reproducibility of their research, as well as their disregard for rigorous scientific and international forensics policies. The report highlights several cases where forensic results were tampered with or forged, leading to false positive results not disclosed by researchers. It emphasizes the importance of transparent and rigorous investigation methods in spyware technology analysis, noting that false positives can lead to erroneous conclusions with significant political implications. The report also questions the credibility of the investigations by Amnesty International and The Citizen Lab due to a lack of transparency regarding false positive results. The report further discusses the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which Morocco acceded to in 2018, and the obligations it entails for mutual assistance in investigations. The report criticizes the European Parliament for condemning Morocco based on unsubstantiated claims of digital espionage. It also examines the funding and potential conflicts of interest of organizations like The Citizen Lab and Amnesty International, which have received financial support from the same institutions they investigate. The report concludes by stressing the need for collaboration between scientists, geo-political analysts, and legal professionals to respond effectively to false accusations and sensationalism."
