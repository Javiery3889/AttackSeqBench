        "Others": "This post was authored by Mariano Graziano. Malware sandboxes are automated dynamic analysis systems that execute programs in a controlled environment. Within the large volumes of samples submitted daily to these services, some submissions appear to be different from others and show interesting characteristics. At USENIX Security 2015, a paper was presented proposing a method to automatically discover malware developments from samples submitted to online dynamic analysis systems. The research dissected the Anubis sandbox dataset, which consisted of over 30M samples collected in six years, and was effective in detecting many interesting cases where malware authors interacted with the sandbox during the development phase of threats.\n\nSurprisingly, some malware samples used in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns had been submitted to the Anubis sandbox months or even years before the attack had been attributed to the proper APT campaign by a security vendor. The research also examined the Cisco dataset, specifically ten APT campaigns, and analyzed two different datasets: incoming sample feeds/malware zoo, and telemetry associated with Cisco's Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) solutions. The analysis revealed that on average, samples went for 458 days before being tied to an APT campaign. The submissions mostly came from large organizations such as antivirus companies, with a significant percentage submitted by VirusTotal.\n\nThe analysis of the submitters' hashes from VirusTotal indicated that the same submitters uploaded samples belonging to different APT campaigns. Cisco AMP logs showed hits for eight different hashes belonging to three different campaigns that were discovered on Cisco AMP customer machines before the APT campaign was publicly identified. One sample of the Equation APT campaign was found and blocked on a Cisco AMP customer's machine a day after the public release of the Kaspersky report.\n\nThe post confirms the assumption of the Usenix paper that many times, malware is initially submitted to sandbox systems and marked as malicious based on the output of the sandbox. Then the authors use that information to tweak the sample to avoid detection in future sandbox runs through various evasion tactics. Identifying today's threats requires multiple layers of protection at various points across the network, along with constantly updated threat intelligence information. Cisco analyzes a massive amount of telemetry data and is able to flag malware as malicious based on multiple factors. By performing manual and programmatic analysis of sandbox data in conjunction with identifying behaviors associated with malicious activity, even unknown APT campaigns can be neutralized."
