        "Others": "The campaign targeted financial institutions and governmental organizations in South America, particularly Colombia. The attackers used open or compromised mail servers in South America and connected to these servers from IP addresses linked to dynamic domain names used by the delivered payloads. The main payload was usually Imminent Monitor RAT, with other RATs observed in different instances. The second stage payload, Proyecto RAT, featured a C&C URL address acquired from YOPmail. The campaign appears to be the work of a group involved in business email compromise (BEC) or cybercrime, rather than an advanced persistent threat (APT). The targeted regions and industries varied, with government entities, healthcare, financial, and agro-industry sectors being prevalent. The campaign's techniques and procedures, as well as indicators of compromise (IoCs), are detailed in an appendix provided by Trend Micro."
