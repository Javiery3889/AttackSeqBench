        "Execution": "AtomBombing is a new code injection technique for Windows that involves three stages: writing arbitrary data to arbitrary locations in the target process's address space, hijacking a thread of the target process to execute the code written, and cleaning up and restoring the execution of the hijacked thread. The technique leverages Windows atom tables and Async Procedure Calls (APC) to achieve code injection without using WriteProcessMemory. The method involves using GlobalAddAtom to store shellcode in the global atom table, which is accessible by all processes, and then using APCs to get the target process to call GlobalGetAtomName and execute the shellcode. The technique bypasses common security solutions and does not require VirtualAllocEx to allocate executable memory in the target process.",
