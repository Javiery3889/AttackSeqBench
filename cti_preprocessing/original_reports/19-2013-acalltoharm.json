        "Initial Access": "The CTI report describes two attacks targeting the Syrian opposition. The first attack involves a malicious installer for the circumvention tool Freegate, which was distributed via a download link on MediaFire. The file, named VPN-Pro.zip, contained a malicious executable that, when run, displayed the Freegate end-user license agreement and launched a legitimate copy of Freegate. However, it also installed a fake 'svchost.exe' in the victim's Application Data directory, which was identified as the ShadowTech RAT, a Remote Access Trojan. The second attack was initiated through phishing emails, chat messages, and Facebook posts, using a Windows Shortcut file that led victims to malicious links while displaying a decoy YouTube video or news website. A PHP file fetched a hex-encoded malicious binary that installed malware persistent across reboots and communicated with a C2 server at tn5.linkpc.net.",
        "Execution": "None",
        "Persistence": "The malware from the second attack described in the CTI report adds a registry key to ensure persistence across reboots. The key added to 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon' sets the 'Shell' value to run 'C:\\WINDOWS\\explorer.exe' along with the malicious 'atiapfxx.exe' from the Temp directory.",

This domain resolves to an IP address within Syrian IP space. Additionally, the malware from the second attack communicates with a C2 server at tn5.linkpc.net, which has been active since at least October 2012 and has pointed to various addresses in Syrian IP space.",
