        "Collection": "The Lookout Threat Intelligence team discovered two novel Android surveillanceware, Hornbill and SunBird, believed to be used by the Confucius APT group. These tools can exfiltrate SMS, encrypted messaging app content, geolocation, call logs, contacts, device metadata, images, WhatsApp voice notes, and more. SunBird can also extract browser history, calendar information, and content from various messaging applications. Data is collected in SQLite databases, compressed into ZIP files, and uploaded to C2 servers. Hornbill focuses on WhatsApp communications, recording calls, and monitoring document activity on external storage. Data is stored in hidden folders and uploaded to C2 infrastructure, with server paths indicating communication with C2 servers.",
        "Command and Control": "SunBird uploads data to command and control (C2) servers at regular intervals, while Hornbill only uploads when data changes. SunBird's C2 infrastructure was insecurely configured, exposing over 18GB of exfiltrated data. The malware uses unique server paths for communication with C2 servers, and the operators behind Hornbill are particularly interested in WhatsApp communications. The C2 domains pieupdate[.]online and samaatv[.]online are associated with Confucius APT infrastructure.",
        "Exfiltration": "SunBird exfiltrated various types of data, including call logs, contacts, device metadata, geolocation, images, WhatsApp voice notes, browser history, calendar information, and content from messaging applications. The malware collected data in SQLite databases, compressed it into ZIP files, and uploaded it to C2 servers. Hornbill exfiltrated data when initially run and then only when changes occurred. Data was stored in hidden folders on external storage and uploaded to C2 infrastructure.",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified Hornbill and SunBird as novel Android surveillanceware linked to the Confucius APT group, active since 2013 and associated with pro-India state-sponsored activities targeting Pakistani and South Asian entities. The malware impersonates legitimate applications and has been found on third-party app stores. The exfiltrated data from C2 servers revealed targeting of individuals linked to Pakistan's military, nuclear authorities, and Indian election officials in Kashmir. The malware's development timeline suggests activity as early as December 2016, with recent samples from December 2020 indicating ongoing deployment. The Confucius group's tactics include impersonating chat applications and using unique server paths for C2 communication. The malware has not been distributed through Google Play, and Lookout security apps protect users from these threats."
