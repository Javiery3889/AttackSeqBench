The group's primary motivation is financial gain, achieved through deploying cryptocurrency miners and other malicious tools. TeamTNT's tactics include exploiting misconfigurations, stealing cloud credentials, and deploying various payloads such as credential stealers, local network scanners, reverse/bind shells, cryptocurrency miners, and IRC bots.\n\nThe report also discusses the evolution of TeamTNT's campaigns and tools, including the use of the Diamorphine rootkit for stealth and persistence, and the development of their IRC bot, TNTbotinger. The impact of their cryptocurrency mining activities is highlighted, with an estimated cost of mining activities provided.\n\nThe report concludes with recommendations for organizations to secure their cloud implementations and minimize the risk of attacks from groups like TeamTNT. It emphasizes the importance of applying the principle of least privilege, updating systems regularly, and using cloud-focused security solutions.\n\nThe appendix includes a list of MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques associated with TeamTNT's activities, as well as indicators of compromise (IoCs) in the form of scripts and binaries with their respective SHA-256 hashes and detection versions."
