The report highlights the use of malicious JavaScript and Java Applets to potentially exploit and install malware on the systems of visitors to these websites. The report also mentions the discovery of a password-protected backdoor webshell, referred to as the Angel Webshell, on the Alliance for True Democracy (ATD) website in Hong Kong. Additionally, the Democratic Party Hong Kong (DPHK) and People Power websites were found to be compromised, with the latter using malicious iFrames leveraging a Chinese URL shortener. The Professional Commons website also had suspicious JavaScript code, suspected to be a formerly active exploit URL. In Japan, the Japanese Nikkei was compromised, with a subdomain used to load JavaScript code and additional files onto other Nikkei web properties. Volexity also came across live exploit code and malware associated with the java-se.com activity, including a digitally signed Java Applet and a newer sample of PlugX malware. The report concludes with the observation that pro-democratic groups are frequently targeted for surveillance and information extraction, and that strategic web compromises have become a key weapon for such operations."
