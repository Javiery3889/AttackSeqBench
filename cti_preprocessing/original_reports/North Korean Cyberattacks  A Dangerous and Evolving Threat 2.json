        "Reconnaissance": "North Korea has conducted cyber guerrilla warfare to steal classified military secrets, absconded with billions of dollars in money and cybercurrency, held computer systems hostage, and inflicted extensive damage on computer networks. Defending against Pyongyang's cyberattacks requires the same constant vigilance and rapidly evolving methods and techniques that law enforcement agencies had to use in response to its evasion of sanctions. The United States has taken only limited actions against North Korean hackers and foreign countries that allow them to operate and launder money from cybercrimes. Without a firm response from the U.S., the North Korean regime will continue to undermine the effectiveness of international sanctions and could inflict even greater damage during a crisis or military conflict.",
