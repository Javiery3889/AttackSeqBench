        "Initial Access": "Invincea has identified a malvertising campaign, dubbed Operation DeathClick, targeting US Defense companies. The campaign leverages real-time ad bidding networks to micro-target organizations and deliver malware through seemingly legitimate advertisements on popular websites. The attackers use IP address ranges, geographic locations, and user interests to target specific companies, with the intent likely being the theft of Intellectual Property. The malvertising campaign utilizes real-time ad bidding to ensure malicious ad delivery to intended targets, exploiting traditional cybercrime methods with advanced threat actor sophistication.",

        "Others": "Invincea's report details the use of real-time ad bidding (RTB) networks by malvertisers to deliver CryptoWall ransomware. The malvertisers bid on ad impressions, ranging from 30 cents to $1.70, using unique identifiers to deliver the ransomware through ads on high-traffic websites. The CryptoWall 2.0 ransomware encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom paid in Bitcoin. Invincea's analysis of the incidents reveals the attackers' use of first-impression.com and other RTB platforms to distribute the malware. The report suggests that the attackers fund their campaigns through click fraud, generating revenue by using infected hosts to click on specific ad banners. The malvertising campaign has been observed on various websites, including sports.yahoo.com, and employs TOR for communication. Invincea's solution has successfully blocked these attempts, preventing CryptoWall from encrypting user file systems."
