        "Execution": "On October 27, 2016, Tal Liberman authored a report revealing a new code injection technique called AtomBombing, which leverages the underlying Windows operating system mechanisms to inject malicious code and bypass security solutions. This technique affects all versions of Windows, including Windows 10, and cannot be patched as it relies on the operating system's design rather than a flaw. AtomBombing exploits atom tables, allowing threat actors to write malicious code into an atom table and manipulate legitimate programs to execute it. This technique is particularly concerning as it can bypass antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and other endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.",

        "Defense Evasion": "The AtomBombing technique enables threat actors to bypass process-level restrictions by injecting malicious code into trusted processes, thereby evading security products. It also allows attackers to access context-specific data, such as screenshots, perform Man in the Browser (MitB) attacks, and access encrypted passwords. AtomBombing is a significant concern for security solutions as it does not require exploiting operating system bugs or vulnerabilities and cannot be fixed with a patch. Security products must monitor API calls for malicious activity to mitigate this technique.",
