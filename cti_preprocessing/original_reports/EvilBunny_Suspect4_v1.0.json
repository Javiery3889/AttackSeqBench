The exploit downloaded and installed the 'bunny dropper' which subsequently installed 'suspect #4' malware on the infected system. Both the dropper and payload were compiled on October 25, 2011, prior to the public release of CVE-2011-4369 on December 16, indicating the attackers either quickly adopted the vulnerability or used a zero-day exploit.",
        "Execution": "None",
        "Persistence": "The 'bunny dropper' ensured persistence by creating a registry key under [HKLM|HKCU]\\...\\CurrentVersion\\Run pointing to the dropped 'netmgr.exe' binary, ensuring its execution at system boot. Additionally, it created a registry key named 'isakmpAutoNegociate' under [HKLM|HKCU]\\Software\\Microsoft\\IPSec for dropper cleanup, which was later used by 'netmgr.exe' to locate and delete the dropper binary.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The 'bunny dropper' performed a sandbox check and enumerated antivirus products to evade detection. It aborted execution if certain conditions were met, such as the module file name being less than 5 characters or containing specific strings, or if less than 15 processes were running. It also accessed the system's WMI to query installed antivirus software. Suspect #4, the payload, aimed to inject itself into an 'svchost.exe' process for stealthiness and relied on the auto-start registry key created by the dropper for persistence.",

The URLs served as contacts for sending commands or Lua scripts to the infected host. The malware also contained a URL 'http://1.9.32.11/bunny/test.php?rec=nvista', but its purpose was unclear as the malware never contacted this IP address.",
