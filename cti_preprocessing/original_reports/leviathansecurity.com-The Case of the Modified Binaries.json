The Tor network is used for anonymity but does not guarantee security. Pitts had previously presented his binary patching framework, BDF, and discussed the potential for MITM patching of binaries during download, which he demonstrated with BDFProxy. He suspected such activities were already happening on the Internet based on circumstantial evidence.\n\nCircumstantial Evidence\n\nMicrosoft Updates Error\n\nPitts tested BDFProxy against various binaries and update processes, including Microsoft Windows Automatic updates. He found that if Windows PE files for Windows Update were actively patched, the update verification process would detect it and produce error code 0x80200053, indicating failed signature verification. The official Microsoft response to this error code involves downloading and executing a 'Fixit' solution executable, which could also be patched by an adversary if downloaded without verification.\n\nNullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) Error\n\nNSIS provides self-checking to ensure binaries are not modified post-compilation. A common error message indicates a failure in this self-checking, suggesting the possibility of patched binaries.\n\nCaught Red-Handed\n\nPitts used exitmap to detect modified binaries in transit over the Internet. He wrote a module for exitmap, named patchingCheck.py, to check exit nodes for traffic modifications. Shortly after, he caught a malicious exit node actively patching binaries. The node, identified as 8361A794DFA231D863E109FC9EEEF21F4CF09DDD, was located in Russia and was patching various binaries from Microsoft, Notepad++, Malwarebytes, Sysinternals, and others. The patched binaries were wrapped within another binary, keeping the .rsrc section intact to avoid triggering NSIS errors and bypass simple self-checking mechanisms.\n\nLeviathan notified the Tor Project of the issue.\n\nGoing Forward\n\nPitts advises companies and developers to host binaries via SSL/TLS and for users, especially in countries hostile to Internet freedom and those using Tor, to be wary of downloading binaries hosted in the clear. Users should verify hashes and signatures out of band before executing binaries."
