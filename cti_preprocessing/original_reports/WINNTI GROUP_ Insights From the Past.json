The Winnti sample, likely developed in 2015, contained a configuration section with a string referring to the campaign name, which is the name of the chemical company. The sample included binaries such as TmPfw-RVS.dll, driver1.sys, driver2.sys, dsefix.exe, and vbox-drv.sys. The dsefix.exe is a Windows x64 Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider, using an included old, legit VirtualBox driver, both signed and exploitable, to bypass driver verification and install its own drivers. The vboxdriver is a vulnerable, correctly signed VirtualBox driver used for exploitation. The driver1.sys and driver2.sys are rootkit drivers capable of injecting and receiving specially formatted network packets, with driver2.sys supporting different versions of Windows.",

The malware dropper was designed to drop and load an additional encrypted payload, with the intended target being the gaming company known for Ragnarok Online. The Winnti Group, also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackfly, is an alleged Chinese state-sponsored umbrella organization linked through shared goals and attack resources. The group has been active since at least 2010, targeting various industries including gaming, chemical, pharmaceutical, technology, and software. The group's evolution involves the enhancement, development, and inclusion of new tools and tactics. The Winnti Group's suspected state-sponsor link to China's government suggests a continued incentive to target industries prioritized for China's economic development."
