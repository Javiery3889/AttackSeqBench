The attackers also infiltrated networks through Java exploitation using the 'Rhino' exploit (CVE-2011-3544). Upon opening the malicious document or visiting a malicious URL on a vulnerable system, the embedded code initiated the setup of the main component for further communication with C&C servers.",
        "Execution": "The execution phase of the 'Red October' campaign involved the setup of the main component after the initial infection. This component handled further communication with the C&C servers. The system received additional spy modules from the C&C server, including modules to handle infection of smartphones. The main purpose of these modules was to steal information, which was then packed, encrypted, and transferred to the C&C server.",

The C&C servers acted as proxies to hide the location of the 'mothership' control server. The backdoor component of the malware communicated with the C&C servers using encrypted connections. During the investigation, over 60 different command-and-control domains were uncovered, and several domains were sinkholed to evaluate the number of victims connecting to them. Over 55,000 connections to the sinkhole were registered, indicating a broad and active C&C infrastructure.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The 'Red October' cyber-espionage network targeted diplomatic, governmental, and scientific research organizations in Eastern Europe, former USSR members, and Central Asia since 2007. The attackers aimed to gather intelligence from compromised organizations, including computer systems, mobile devices, and network equipment. The attackers reused information harvested from infected networks in later attacks, such as stolen credentials. The unique architecture of the malware allowed for quick extension of features and resistance to C&C server takeover. The attackers imported exploit code for vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word and Excel from other cyber attacks, leaving the code untouched to hinder identification. Based on C&C server registration data and artifacts in malware executables, the attackers are believed to have Russian-speaking origins. The campaign involved over 1000 different malicious files related to over 30 modules of the Trojan kit, with file creation dates indicating the timing of massive attacks. The Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) and sinkhole data revealed a wide range of targets, including government research institutes, foreign embassies, and organizations in the energy and aerospace sectors. The attackers' domains were registered using services like 'reg.ru', and the malicious servers were mostly located in Germany. An image of one of the C&C servers showed it was a proxy forwarding requests to another server, suggesting a layered C&C infrastructure. The backdoor identified itself to the C&C with a unique victim ID, allowing the attackers to distinguish between victims and perform specific operations individually."
