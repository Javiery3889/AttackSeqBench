        "Others": "G DATA Security BlogSecurity Blog\n\n02/18/2015 | Bochum, Author: Paul RascagnresBabar: espionage software finally found and put under the microscopeG DATA experts analyze malware mentioned in CSEC documents leaked by Snowden\n\nAlmost a year after Operation SNOWGLOBE was publicly mentioned for the first time by the famous French newspaper Le Monde, security experts have now laid hands on malware samples that match the descriptions made by the Communication Security Establishment Canada (CSEC). The following analysis is the first report about the espionage malware dubbed Babar, which the whole computer security community searched for. After the disclosure about EvilBunny [1], Babar is now a second component identified to be related to Operation SNOWGLOBE and is believed to be coded by the same developers. Babar's feature set includes keystroke logging, clipboard logging and, most interesting, the possibility to log audio conversations \n\nThe malware names: are the coders cartoonists?\nLooking at the compilation path stored in the binary, we can identify the internal name of the projects:C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\bunny 2.3.2\\Release\\Transporter2.pdbC:\\Documents and Settings\\admin\\Desktop\\Babar64\\Babar64\\obj\\DllWrapperRelease\\Release.pdb\n\nFurthermore, a command and control server of an EvilBunny sample also mentioned the sample project name: hxxp://1.9.32.11/bunny/test.php?rec=nvista.\n\nBabar's espionage features\nThe RAT has common features such as code execution, code injection into running processes, file stealing (the extensions listed in the configuration file come into play at this pint). However, Babar has additional features such as being a key logger in order to record key strokes and it also has the possibility to steal the clipboard content (frequently used to store passwords in case the user uses password storage application such as KeePass). The data is stored in the file %COMMON_APPDATA%\\MSI\\update.msi. Here are two screenshots of the key logger API:\n\nAnd the following is a snippet of the clipboard stealer API:\n\nBabar is also able to take screenshots of the infected desktop (thanks to the GdiPlus API).Here is a snippet of the GdiPlus API:\n\nAnd finally, as every elephant, Babar has big ears and the malware is able to listen to conversations and log them by using the dsound and winmm libraries. We assume that the process list of the instant messaging services, seen in the configuration, is used to identify when the malware should enable this feature. The following screenshot shows the use of the wave* API to record the audio flow:\n\nLooking at the feature list, we can identify that this malware is meant to be a pure espionage tool. It is, regarding the current information, not harming the computer system itself but represents an elaborate instrument to function as wiretap and to exfiltrated data from computers infected. This leads to the assumption that the number of infected machines is rather small and chosen.\n\nConclusion\nAfter having more information about the malware attributed to operation SNOWGLOBE, taken from the re-published slides, the G DATA experts are sure to have found samples which match the descriptions. EvilBunny and Babar might correspond to two of the three \"implants\" mentioned as Snowballs and Snowman.\n\nThe G DATA SecurityLabs are convinced that the number of similarities identified between EvilBunny and Babar show that both malware families originate from the same developers.The evil cartoon malware families share part of their code. The analyses suggest that the samples identified are newer versions of the malware CSEC described in the slides. This may be one reason for the absence of certain indications CSEC has mentioned.\n\nNevertheless, unfortunately, the experts cannot contribute further information with regards to the malware's origin nor the list of victims. The information CSEC provided was partly supported by indications found in the code, but no clue has been identified. The assertion of a \"French intelligence community\" being responsible remains unchanged. Attributing malware to any origin, especially when dealing with specialized and professional malware, has always been difficult.\n\nWith a possible nation-state background, this espionage software would not be spread as mass malware but activated against specific and chosen targets only. The main functions of this malware are data exfiltration and wiretapping."
