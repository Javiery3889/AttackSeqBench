UP007 was previously observed in a report by Arbor Security Emergency Response Team (ASERT) and was also mentioned in a recent report by ASERT describing campaigns targeting Tibetan, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese interests. A PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report included analysis of the SLServer sample. Both UP007 and SLServer were sent to targets in the same attack. The UP007 malware logs keystrokes and sends them to a remote server. The SLServer sample is a self-extracting archive responsible for downloading a binary from a website that was likely compromised. The campaigns share some C2 infrastructure with previous operations against targets in Thailand and the Tibetan community. The domain registration connections between SLServer infrastructure and Surtr infrastructure also suggest some level of potential coordination between campaigns targeting Hong Kong groups and the Tibetan community."
