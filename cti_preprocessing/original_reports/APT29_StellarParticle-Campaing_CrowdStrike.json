        "Initial Access": "The StellarParticle campaign, associated with COZY BEAR, utilized various initial access techniques. They gained access to the victim's network by logging into a public-facing system via Secure Shell (SSH) using a local account acquired during previous credential theft activities. They also used port forwarding capabilities to establish a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session to internal servers using different domain accounts. Additionally, the threat actor used VPNs to gain access to systems and persist in the environment. They exported saved passwords from users' Chrome browser installations.",
        "Execution": "None",
        "Persistence": "The StellarParticle campaign demonstrated persistence by using credential hopping, where different credentials were leveraged for each step while moving laterally through the victim's network. They also used accounts with Delegated Administrator rights to access other O365 tenants and create persistence within the environment. TrailBlazer malware was configured for WMI persistence, and GoldMax malware was configured for persistence via a crontab entry. The threat actor added credentials to O365 Service Principals and created new O365 Service Principals to maintain access to victim's environments.",

        "Defense Evasion": "The StellarParticle campaign involved defense evasion techniques such as stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) and using renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries. They also renamed their systems prior to connecting to victim's VPNs to match the victim's system naming convention.",
        "Credential Access": "The StellarParticle campaign involved various credential access techniques. They stole web session cookies from end-user workstations to access cloud resources and used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP throughout the environment. They also used compromised service principals to make changes to the Office 365 environment and accessed data from Information Repositories.",
        "Discovery": "The threat actor used AdFind, standard PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to identify various pieces of information from Active Directory. They regularly interrogated other systems using tasklist.exe and probed external services in an attempt to regain access to the environment.",
