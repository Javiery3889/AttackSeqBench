These documents are hosted on Google Drive. The earliest document, named 'Urgent.docx' from November 2019, prompts users to enable editing in English and Arabic. Another document named 'fb.docx' from early January contains alleged Facebook usernames and passwords. A more recent document from mid-January appears to be from a United Arab Emirates organization and asks users to enable editing to view blurred content.",
        "Execution": "The malicious Office document's Macro executes only if a disk serial number is detected, which is a technique to avoid virtual machine detection. The Macro then downloads an image from Google Drive, which contains a base64-encoded binary appended at the end, separated by the string '****'. The binary is an AutoIT script that downloads a new file from Google Drive.",

        "Command and Control": "JhoneRAT uses cloud services for command and control activities.

Commands can be issued to specific victims based on a UID generated on each target or to all victims.",

        "Others": "The JhoneRAT campaign is focused on specific Middle Eastern and Arabic-speaking countries and leverages cloud providers for operations. The campaign started in November 2019 and is ongoing. The attackers have implemented anti-VM and anti-analysis tricks. The campaign demonstrates the importance of network-based detection complemented by system behavior analysis. The threat actors' infrastructure includes URLs hosted on Google Drive and a Twitter account. Cisco Talos Intelligence Group provides various ways to detect and block this threat, including Advanced Malware Protection (AMP), Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS), Email Security, Network Security appliances, AMP Threat Grid, Umbrella, and the Open Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set."
