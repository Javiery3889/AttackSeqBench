The email uses social engineering, presenting a message in Spanish about scheduled payment dates. The Excel sheet displays a blurred image, prompting users to enable macros, which triggers the execution of a malicious macro.",
        "Execution": "The malicious macro, once enabled, downloads a second-stage downloader.

The malware checks if a specific file exists and, if not, injects a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe.

The adversaries behind Lokibot are capable of stealing multiple types of credentials and sensitive information. The campaign uses social engineering techniques to trick users into enabling macros, which leads to the execution of the malware. The infection chain is sophisticated, with three stages and three layers of encryption to hide the final payload. The dropper injects code into a suspended process to bypass UAC and uses process hollowing to execute its final payload. The blog post emphasizes the importance of a multi-layered security architecture to detect such attacks."
