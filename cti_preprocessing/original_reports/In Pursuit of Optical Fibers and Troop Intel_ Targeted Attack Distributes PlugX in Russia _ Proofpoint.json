The campaign involved spear-phishing emails with exploit-laden Microsoft Word document attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to implant the PlugX RAT. An example attachment named LTE-2600.doc was sent to financial analysts covering the telecom industry. Additionally, URLs leading to RAR archives hosted on fake domains registered for the campaign were used to distribute PlugX. These domains mimicked legitimate Russian military and news websites, with payload file names fitting specific lures related to military events.",
        "Execution": "The PlugX RAT was implanted using DLL side-loading techniques, with all payloads using a clean signed executable 'fsguidll.exe' to sideload 'fslapi.dll', which unpacks code from 'fslapi.dll.gui'. The variant of PlugX used is the P2P version described by JPCert.",

        "Defense Evasion": "One RAR SFX dropper displayed a decoy Microsoft Word document referencing the 'Tsar Bomba' nuclear test before launching the executable, a technique seen as a sandbox evasion method.

        "Others": "The campaign targeted Russian-speaking financial analysts working at global financial firms and covering telecom corporations in Russia, likely due to collateral damage. The attackers, believed to operate out of China and tracked as TA459, have targeted various military installations in Central Asia in the past. The campaign employed other backdoors such as Saker, Netbot, and DarkStRat. The attackers demonstrated a keen interest in Russian telecom and military sectors, indicative of geopolitical motives, and adapted their tactics over time. The operation spanned at least two years, with the attackers investing time to research targets and leveraging current events in their tactics. Advanced threat defense solutions are recommended to combat such targeted attacks."
