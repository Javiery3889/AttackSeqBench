The dropper, identified by SHA256 hash e1741e02d9387542cc809f747c78d5a352e7682a9b83cbe210c09e2241af6078, exports a function named 'LocalDataVer' which serves as an entry point for the DLL. This function is used to deploy the backdoor and its configuration file, avoiding detection by sandbox solutions and manual analysis by terminating the program if 'DllMain' or 'DllRegisterServer' are used as entry points.",

        "Defense Evasion": "The NewPass implant uses a loader library to decode a binary file and extract the agent component responsible for specific operations. The loader and agent share a JSON configuration in memory, which allows the attackers to customize the implant by changing configuration entries. The loader checks for the presence of an associated configuration file and decodes the initial configuration using a simple XOR algorithm. The final agent is hidden in the configuration file after a section of random bytes used to change the hash value of the file at every infection.",

The malware is composed of different components, including a dropper, a loader library, and an agent, which rely on an encoded file to pass information and configuration between each other. The implant supports different types of persistence mechanisms and is identified by an ID used during communication with the C2 as an identifier of the infected machine. The malware version numbers are 19.03.28 for the AgentLoader and 19.7.16 for the Agent."
