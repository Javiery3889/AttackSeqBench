Law enforcement agencies require timely and accurate criminal intelligence analysis to effectively counter these evolving criminal markets and networks. The report identifies five broad crime areas posing significant transnational security threats: organized crime, illicit trafficking, financial crime, cybercrime, and terrorism. \n\nKey global trends include the resilience of organized crime groups, the prevalence of synthetic drug and cannabis trafficking, the pervasive nature of human trafficking and migrant smuggling, the high threat of financial fraud and money laundering, and the global impact of ransomware, phishing, and online scams. Jihadist terrorism remains the most significant terrorist threat, with Islamic State-affiliate groups gaining influence in sub-Saharan Africa. The use of advanced technologies by terrorists, such as drones and encrypted messaging, is also noted. \n\nThe report emphasizes the convergence of crime areas and the transformative role of technological innovation and digitalization in enabling crime and terrorism. It calls for continuous efforts to understand criminal convergences and the impact of new technologies on crime prevention and disruption strategies. \n\nRegional trends highlight the specific threats in different areas, including the increase in terrorism in the Sahel sub-region, the rapid digitalization in the financial sector in Africa leading to more online banking scams, the substantial rise of extreme far-right terrorism in North America, the dominance of synthetic drugs and heroin trafficking in Asia, and the growing violence of organized crime in Europe. \n\nINTERPOL's role in supporting law enforcement to counter global and regional crime trends is underscored. The organization's unique position allows it to monitor and assess transnational crime trends and support member countries with policing capabilities tailored to their needs. Projects like I-CAN aim to disrupt powerful organized crime groups, while coordinated cross-border operations target traffickers and rescue victims. \n\nThe report calls for a concerted approach to combat financial crime and corruption, emphasizing the need for international cooperation in asset recovery. It also highlights the importance of collective efforts to prevent, detect, investigate, and disrupt cybercrime, with INTERPOL's strategy being multilateral and intelligence-oriented. \n\nMember countries are encouraged to establish specialized units to combat online child sexual exploitation and abuse (OCSEA) and to engage in multilateral cooperation to counter terrorism. The report concludes with a commitment to improve analytical methodologies and data collection strategies for future assessments of global and regional crime trends."
