        "Reconnaissance": "None",
        "Resource Development": "ESET researchers discovered an ongoing campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur, which has been active since at least August 2021. The campaign targets research entities, internet service providers, and European diplomatic missions, leveraging current events in Europe, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to lure victims with phishing documents. The group behind the campaign, attributed to Mustang Panda (also known as TA416, RedDelta, or PKPLUG), is known for targeting governmental entities and NGOs, primarily in East and Southeast Asia, with a focus on Mongolia. They have also targeted the Vatican in 2020. The campaign uses custom loaders for shared malware like Cobalt Strike, Poison Ivy, and Korplug, and is characterized by the use of anti-analysis techniques and control-flow obfuscation at every stage of the deployment process.",
        "Initial Access": "The initial access vector is not explicitly observed but is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks. The campaign uses filenames related to current events, such as 'COVID-19 travel restrictions EU reviews list of third countries.exe' and 'Situation at the EU borders with Ukraine.exe', to deliver a downloader that also opens a decoy document to distract the victim. These documents are often legitimate and publicly accessible, reflecting the filenames used.",
        "Execution": "Mustang Panda's campaign utilizes a custom loader to execute the new Korplug variant. The loader is a DLL that exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable. The loader exports multiple functions, but only one function is responsible for loading the final malware stage. The loader function decrypts the encrypted Korplug file in memory and makes the buffer executable before calling into it.",
        "Persistence": "The Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a directory under %allusersprofile%, marking it as hidden and system, and copying the necessary files to this directory. It then sets up persistence either by creating a scheduled task to run at boot or by adding a registry entry to Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. The malware launches the executable from its new location and exits.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "Mustang Panda's campaign features heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques at every stage of the deployment process. The downloader and loader use various methods to obfuscate the control flow, including junk code, opaque predicates, and encrypted stack strings. The Korplug file is encrypted and only decrypted at runtime, and its configuration data is encrypted with XOR. The directories created during the installation process are set as hidden system directories, and the malware can run commands on a hidden desktop.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "The Korplug variant collects extensive information about the system, including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, amount of RAM, and display resolution. It also retrieves the system locale, hostname, and IP addresses, and uses GetSystemTime to retrieve the current system time.",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. It can list files and directories along with their attributes and content, and collects metadata and content from all mapped drives.",
        "Command and Control": "Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol. The initial handshake can be done over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent communication is always done over TCP. The communication is encrypted using RC4 and may use non-standard ports. The configuration contains fallback C&C servers, and Korplug can download additional files from the C&C server.",
        "Exfiltration": "Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used to send and receive commands, involving TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The campaign uses filenames that reflect current events to lure victims, demonstrating Mustang Panda's ability to quickly react to world events. The group iteratively improves its tools, including the use of trident downloaders to deploy Korplug. ESET Research offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds, and inquiries can be directed to threatintel@eset.com."
