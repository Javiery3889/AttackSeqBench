        "Reconnaissance": "The Geumseong121 APT hacking group carried out a mobile APT attack, distributing a malicious app (APK) via a website disguised as a fundraising service for North Korean defectors. The website, built on the WordPress platform, was created on August 23, 2019, and updated on October 22. The site featured snapshots from September 11 to October, indicating it supported North Korean defectors, and added an Android app installation link in October. The site used various promotion strategies to trick users into installing the app. The operation, named \"Dragon Messenger,\" involved the malicious application collecting data via the 'DragonTask' path and the attack being performed under the guise of a secure messenger.",

        "Initial Access": "The malicious app was distributed through a website that appeared to be a charity site supporting North Korean defectors. The app was registered on the official Google Play Store but has since been removed by Google. The app claimed to offer services for North Korean defectors to share life-related issues and specify donation services. The attackers also used YouTube and Facebook to promote the app and prepare the attack, with about 330 friends registered on Facebook, potentially exposing them to threats.",
