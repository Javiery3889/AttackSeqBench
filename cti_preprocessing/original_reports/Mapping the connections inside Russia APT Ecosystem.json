The research analyzed approximately 2,000 samples attributed to Russian APTs, revealing 22,000 connections between samples and 3.85 million non-unique pieces of code. These samples were classified into 60 families and 200 modules. The findings indicated that Russian APT actors generally do not share code with one another, suggesting a high level of operational security. The research also released tools for the community, including an interactive map of Russian APT connections and a signature-based tool for scanning hosts or files for common code used by Russian APTs. The research verified previously reported connections between different malware families with code similarity analysis and provided new insights into the Russian APT ecosystem."
