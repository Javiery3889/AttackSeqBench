In Belgium, attackers placed a recommended link to their ralrab[.]com site in the middle of the localized WinRAR distribution page on winrar[.]be. The winrar[.]be site evaluated what package a visitor may need based on browser localization and processor capability, offering up appropriate trojanized versions. Similarly, the winrar[.]it site served trojanized installers directly from the site itself, affecting a large majority of Italian visitors. StrongPity also directed specific visitors from popular, localized software sharing sites directly to their trojanized installers, continuing this activity into late September 2016. In particular, the group redirected visitors from software aggregation and sharing site tamindir[.]com to their attacker-controlled site at true-crypt[.]com, which is a complete rip of the legitimate site, now hosted by Sourceforge.",

        "Others": "The StrongPity APT group has been operating under the radar for several years, deploying zero-day exploits, effectively spearphishing targets, and maintaining a modular toolset. They have shown a particular interest in users of encryption tools, with a focus on Italian and Belgian users. The group has been reckless and innovative, using watering holes and poisoned installer tactics. They targeted encryption tools like WinRAR and TrueCrypt, which provide strong and reliable encryption. The group's malware components provide complete control of the victim system, steal disk contents, and can download components for further collection of communications and contacts. The droppers were often signed with unusual digital certificates, and the malware sought out several crypto-enabled software applications, highlighting the group's interest in users of more encryption-supported software suites. The group's activity surged in late summer 2016, with malware delivered from winrar.it appearing on over 600 systems throughout Europe and Northern Africa/Middle East. The top countries affected by StrongPity malware from the winrar.it site were Italy, Belgium, Algeria, Cote D'Ivoire, Morocco, France, and Tunisia. The group's malware also targeted systems in Turkey, with victims in the Netherlands as well. StrongPity's tactics have been seen with other APTs, but their focus on cryptographic-enabled software is unique. The necessity for verifying the validity of distribution sites and the integrity of downloaded files has become more important, and stronger anti-malware and dynamic whitelisting solutions are needed."
