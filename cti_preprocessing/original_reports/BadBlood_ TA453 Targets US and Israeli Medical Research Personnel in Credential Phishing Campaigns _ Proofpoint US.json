The campaign utilized an actor-controlled Gmail account, which impersonated a prominent Israeli physicist, to send phishing emails with the subject 'Nuclear weapons at a glance: Israel'. These emails contained a link to a TA453-controlled domain, 1drv[.]casa, which spoofed Microsoft's OneDrive service and presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.",

The phishing emails directed victims to a forged Microsoft login page on the domain 1drv[.]casa, where credentials were collected. There was no indication of multi-factor authentication bypass being conducted. The use of harvested credentials by TA453 in this campaign is not fully known, but previous public reporting from CERTFA suggests that TA453 has used such credentials to exfiltrate email inbox contents and for further phishing activities.",

The campaign's objective remains unclear, but it may involve collecting specific medical information or using compromised accounts for further phishing. Attribution to the IRGC is not independently confirmed by Proofpoint, but the tactics and techniques observed are consistent with historic TA453 campaigns. Related infrastructure identified by Proofpoint includes additional domains with high confidence attributed to TA453, used in similar campaigns with national security-themed lure documents. The targeting of medical research is part of a global trend of increased espionage against the medical sector."
