        "Initial Access": "The PROMETHIUM threat actor, active since 2012, has been using trojanized installation files of well-known applications such as Firefox, VPNpro, DriverPack, and 5kPlayer to gain initial access to victims' systems. These trojanized files install both the malware and the legitimate application, which helps to disguise the malicious activities. The group has targeted victims in Colombia, India, Canada, and Vietnam.",
        "Execution": "The execution of the PROMETHIUM malware involves the use of trojanized installers that deploy the malware alongside legitimate applications. The malware uses a service for persistence and executes a PowerShell command to reconfigure Windows Defender, adding exclusions for the malware's directories and preventing sample submission. The service executable's sole purpose is to launch the C2 contact module upon service startup.",
        "Persistence": "PROMETHIUM achieves persistence by creating a service that launches the C2 contact module upon service startup. The service name changes from package to package, and the dropped files are stored in a specific Temp folder pattern.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "To evade detection, the PROMETHIUM malware performs checks for ESET or BitDefender antivirus before dropping the malware. If these antiviruses are installed, the malware will not be dropped. Additionally, the malware adds its directories to the Windows Defender exclusions list using a PowerShell command.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "None",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files found on the system. It uses a document search module to parse the hard drive for files with specific extensions, compresses them into an archive, and encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server.",
        "Command and Control": "PROMETHIUM's C2 infrastructure includes around 30 new C2 domains identified by Cisco Talos. The domains are hardcoded into the malware, suggesting the use of a Builder tool to generate the binaries. The C2 servers communicate over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.",
        "Exfiltration": "The malware exfiltrates encoded archives containing documents to the C2 server. The archives are encoded using an unusual scheme and split into chunks if larger than a certain size before being sent.",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "PROMETHIUM has been resilient over the years, continuing its activities despite being exposed multiple times. The group's campaigns have been clustered based on domain creation dates, with some campaigns overlapping and going back to 2018. The threat actor's focus has expanded from Europe and the Middle East to a global operation targeting organizations on most continents. The characteristics of the malware suggest that PROMETHIUM could be part of an enterprise service for hire operation. Cisco Talos provides various ways for customers to detect and block this threat, including Advanced Malware Protection (AMP), Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS), Email Security, Network Security appliances, AMP Threat Grid, Umbrella, and Snort Subscriber Rule Set."
