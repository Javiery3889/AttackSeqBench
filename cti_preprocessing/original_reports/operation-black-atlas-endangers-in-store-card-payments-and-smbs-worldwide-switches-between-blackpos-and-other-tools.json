        "Reconnaissance": "Operation Black Atlas involves an intelligence gathering or reconnaissance period where cybercriminals use a set of tools similar to a Swiss army knife to check how best to infiltrate systems. It also involves the use of tools such as brute force or dictionary attack tools, SMTP scanners, and remote desktop viewers. Networks with weak password practices are likely to fall victim to this initial penetration testing stage. Many of these tools are easily downloaded from various sites on the Internet. The most interesting data we found was that of a live video feed of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in a gasoline station. Either this is taking reconnaissance to another real-time level or the cybercriminals simply captured whatever information is available.",

        "Others": "Trend Micro's Security Intelligence Blog reported on Operation Black Atlas, which endangers in-store card payments and SMBs worldwide. The operation, active since September 2015, uses a variety of penetration testing tools and has connections to PoS malware in the underground market. It targets businesses in healthcare, retail, and more, relying on card payment systems. The operation uses malware like Alina, NewPOSThings, Kronos backdoor, and BlackPOS, the latter being used in the Target breach of 2013. The Black Atlas operators employ a \"shotgun\" approach to infiltrate networks, scanning available ports on the Internet to find multiple targets globally. The operation also uses the modular botnet Gorynych or Diamond Fox to download repurposed BlackPOS malware with RAM scraping functionality and upload stolen credit card numbers. The cybercriminals create a test plan based on initial probes and use remote access tools to steal more information and move laterally within networks. The introduction of PoS threats is done via built-in command-line FTP, as antimalware solutions had already blocked the initial site hosting Katrina and CenterPoS. The operation has stolen user credentials to websites, email accounts, Facebook, and even accessed a live video feed from CCTV cameras at a gasoline station. The article is authored by Jay Yaneza, a Threats Analyst at Trend Micro, and was posted on December 1, 2015."
