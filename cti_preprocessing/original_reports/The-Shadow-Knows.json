The campaign involves creating fraudulent subdomains, such as ads.mikeholt[.]com, under legitimate domains using stolen credentials. The malicious ad server includes filtering settings to serve harmless ad code to non-targeted clients. Targeted clients, however, are subjected to a multi-step attack that involves filtering proxied traffic, decoding a bogus GIF, and leveraging information disclosure bugs in Internet Explorer to avoid detection by researchers and security products. The attack abuses an HTTPS open redirect by DoubleClick and lands the browser on Angler EK without a referrer. The Bedep malware, specifically 'buildId' 1926, was observed loading various malware payloads, including Fileless Ursnif, Ramnit, Blowcrypt, Vawtrak campaigns 13 and 60, and Reactor Bot. The report concludes that malvertising remains an effective malware distribution method due to the evolving techniques of threat actors. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and ET signatures related to the campaign are provided."
