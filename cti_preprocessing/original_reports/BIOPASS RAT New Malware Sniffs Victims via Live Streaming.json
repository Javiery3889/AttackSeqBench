        "Others": "The BIOPASS RAT malware was capable of file system assessment, remote desktop access, file exfiltration, and shell command execution. It could also steal web browser and instant messaging client data, compromising the victims' private information. Notably, BIOPASS RAT could live stream the victim's screen by abusing the Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) Studio framework, streaming to a cloud service via Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). The attack also misused Alibaba Cloud's object storage service (OSS) to host the BIOPASS RAT Python scripts and store exfiltrated data. The malware was still under active development, with references to different versions of RAT code, such as \"V2\" and \"BPSV3\". Scheduled tasks were created to load Cobalt Strike shellcode during initialization, indicating reliance on Cobalt Strike by the threat actor. There were also indications of a possible connection between the malware and the Winnti Group (APT41). The infection chain involved injecting a custom JavaScript code into the target's online support chat page, scanning the host, and replacing the original page content with a fake error message instructing visitors to download a malicious loader. The legitimate applications were downloaded and executed, and Visual C++ and Python runtimes were also downloaded from attacker-controlled Alibaba Cloud OSS accounts. The BIOPASS RAT modules included a 'cdaemon' module, a 'c1222' module that ran an HTTP server to avoid repeated infection, and a 'big' module responsible for implementing the BIOPASS RAT malware. The malware communicated with the C&C server using the Socket.io protocol, with encrypted communication. It registered custom event handlers for 'notice', 'set key', and 'accept task'. The malware could execute various commands, including taking screenshots, executing shell commands, listing processes, and stealing browser data. Additional Python plugins were observed, such as 'getwechatdb' for exfiltrating WeChat chat history and 'xss_spoof' for web server infection via XSS attacks. The researchers found connections between BIOPASS RAT and the Winnti Group, including the use of stolen certificates from game studios and a server-side variant of the Derusbi malware sample signed with the same stolen certificate. The researchers emphasized the importance of downloading from trusted sources to avoid such attacks and reported the abuse to Alibaba."
