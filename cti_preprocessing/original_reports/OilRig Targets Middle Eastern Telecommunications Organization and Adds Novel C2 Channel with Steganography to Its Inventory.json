        "Command and Control": "While analyzing an attack against a Middle Eastern telecommunications organization, a variant of an OilRig-associated tool called RDAT was discovered, which uses a novel email-based command and control (C2) channel. This channel relies on steganography to hide commands and data within bitmap images attached to emails. RDAT has been under active development since 2017, with multiple variations relying on both HTTP and DNS tunneling for C2 communications. In June 2018, the developer of RDAT added the ability to use Exchange Web Services (EWS) to send and receive emails for C2 communications. The combination of using emails with steganographic images to carry the data across the C2 can result in this activity being much more difficult to detect and allow for higher chances of defense evasion. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by WildFire and Cortex XDR, which identifies all RDAT samples as malicious, as well as DNS Security and URL Filtering, which identifies and blocks the C2 activity.",
