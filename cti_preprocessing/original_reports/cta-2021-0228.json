        "Command and Control": "The report identifies the use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure, which includes ShadowPad command and control (C2) servers, by the threat activity group RedEcho to target India's power sector. This infrastructure is shared with other Chinese state-sponsored groups such as APT41 and Tonto Team. The network traffic to adversary infrastructure was primarily over SSL via TCP port 443, with substantial inbound traffic indicative of HTTP proxying over TCP 8080 and DNS requests for the C2 domains hosted on these servers.",

        "Others": "The report by Insikt Group details a campaign by China-linked RedEcho targeting the Indian power sector amid heightened border tensions. The activity was identified through network traffic analytics and expert analysis, with data sources including the Recorded Future Platform and other tools. Recorded Future notified Indian government departments prior to publication to support incident response. The campaign involved targeting 10 Indian power sector organizations and 2 seaports, with suspected intrusions into at least 4 Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDCs) responsible for power grid operation. The report assesses that the targeting poses significant concerns over potential pre-positioning of network access to support Chinese strategic objectives. RedEcho's infrastructure overlaps with APT41/Barium and Tonto Team, and ShadowPad is used by at least 5 distinct Chinese groups. The report also discusses the use of ShadowPad, a modular backdoor, by various China-nexus groups and its connection to a centralized developer or quartermaster. Recorded Future's Network Traffic Analysis analytics were used to track suspected targeted intrusion activity and proactive infrastructure detections. The report includes recommendations for detecting and mitigating activity associated with RedEcho."
