The variant, named THOR, was first seen in August 2019 and includes new features like enhanced payload-delivery mechanisms. It is associated with the Chinese cyberespionage group PKPLUG (aka Mustang Panda). Unit 42 developed a tool for payload decryption. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from PlugX with Cortex XDR, the Next-Generation Firewall with WildFire, and Threat Prevention security subscriptions. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are provided to identify the PlugX variant in networks."
