The first one is relevant for organizations with self-hosted web services. If such a public-facing web service is running on a server that is connected to an internal network, attackers will try to compromise it and then sneak inside the network. The second infection vector is the use of spearphishing emails with malicious attachments. Malicious documents have been dropping \"GreyEnergy mini\", a lightweight first-stage backdoor that does not require administrative privileges. After compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, attackers map the network and collect passwords in order to obtain domain administrator privileges. With these privileges, the attackers can control the whole network. The GreyEnergy group uses fairly standard tools for these tasks: Nmap and Mimikatz.",
