The malware is a 32-bit Windows executable with a wiping routine, indicating it is part of a more complex system. Static analysis by Kyle Wilhoit of Trend Micro and Jake Williams of Rendition Security confirmed its modular nature and anti-forensic wiping capability. The malware does not use all imported functions, suggesting borrowed code from a development shop's codebase. The compile timestamp is January 6, 1999, likely altered by attackers. The malware's hash is available on VirusTotal, submitted by a Ukrainian user on December 23.",

Speculation links the malware to BlackEnergy2, but this is low-confidence. The incident emphasizes the need for active defense and basic threat analysis in ICS facilities. The international response to such attacks will set precedents. Upcoming webcasts by SANS ICS will discuss the event and other case studies."
