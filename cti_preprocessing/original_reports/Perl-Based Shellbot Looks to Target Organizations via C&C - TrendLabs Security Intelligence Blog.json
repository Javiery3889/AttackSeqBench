They then linked two compromised servers to a high availability cluster to host an IRC bouncer for command and control.",
        "Execution": "The Shellbot, written in Perl, is distributed by exploiting a command injection vulnerability on IoT devices and Linux servers. It can also affect Windows environments and Android devices. The botnet was previously spread via the Shellshock vulnerability but now is mostly distributed via brute-forced or compromised hosts.",

        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Shellbot assigns hardcoded process names to hide from system admins, security monitoring, and researchers. It also uses PING/PONG communication to keep the IRC channel open and avoid disconnection.",

        "Collection": "None",
        "Command and Control": "The Shellbot establishes C&C communication immediately after infection and maintains it. The IRC channel is used to send various commands to the host, including commands for port scanning, DDoS attacks, file downloads, and obtaining information about other machines.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The Outlaw group's operation involves targeting organizations for cybercriminal purposes using DoS and SSH brute force attacks. The group operates mostly during business hours, suggesting a daily operation schedule. Security measures recommended include proper SSH setup, CLI command monitoring, non-DNS traffic monitoring, account creation detection, FTP usage restriction, Dovecot mail server vulnerability patching, and maintaining contact for security compromise reporting. Trend Micro's XGen security provides protection against such threats."
