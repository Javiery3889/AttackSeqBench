The emails used the subject line \"Wanna see the Game of Thrones in advance?\" and included a Microsoft Word attachment named \"game of thrones preview.docx\". This document contained an embedded .LNK object that, if executed, would run a malicious PowerShell script leading to the installation of the \"9002\" RAT.",
        "Execution": "The .LNK object in the malicious email attachment executes a PowerShell command using a modified Invoke-Shellcode script to download two files obfuscated with XOR and base64. The first file contains the 9002 RAT shellcode that is injected into the legitimate Windows Mail binary wabmig.exe. The second file is a .LNK file used to maintain persistence on the infected machine. The persistence .LNK is stored in the Startup directory as UpdateCheck.lnk and contains a PowerShell script nearly identical to the .LNK downloader, but instead of downloading shellcode, it opens, decodes, and injects the already downloaded shellcode into a newly created wabmig.exe process.",
        "Persistence": "The persistence mechanism involves a .LNK file named UpdateCheck.lnk, which is stored in the Startup directory.

The HTTP traffic and encoding used by this variant have several distinguishing characteristics, including data sent to the C&C in an encoded state using a custom algorithm followed by base64-encoding. The malware also attempts to mimic SSL traffic to login.live[.]com by sending that domain in the SNI field. Additionally, if the same URI is requested with any User-Agent, a legitimate JPG is returned instead of the payload, indicating an evasion technique to avoid detection by automated systems.",

The encoding algorithm is an iteration of the \"4-byte XOR version of 9002\" analyzed by FireEye. The malware uses a dynamic 4-byte XOR key along with a static 38-byte seed to generate a final 256-byte XOR key. The HTTP POST requests contain hardcoded Accept and User-Agent headers, and two different hardcoded URIs are used for communication. The RAT also uses fake SSL communication, attempting to mimic legitimate SSL traffic to login.live[.]com.",

        "Others": "The campaign was attributed to a state-sponsored actor, possibly the Chinese government, based on similarities with previous attacks such as Operation Aurora and Operation Ephemeral Hydra. The 9002 RAT has been historically used by these actors, and the current campaign's use of a Game of Thrones lure is consistent with the tactic of using timely and relevant lures. The attack was blocked by Proofpoint systems, but the sophistication of the delivery mechanisms and the RAT itself pose significant threats to corporate data and systems. The campaign may be connected to the Deputy Dog (APT17) actor, based on shared identifiers and similarities in code, payload, file names, images, and themes. The earliest use of the malicious LNK PowerShell downloader was identified in a file uploaded to a malicious file scanning service on July 6, 2017."
