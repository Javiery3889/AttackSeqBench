        "Others": "The article by RFSID, posted on February 11, 2016, discusses the cyber rivalry between India and Pakistan, particularly in the context of hacktivism. It highlights how significant events such as Independence Days and cricket matches between the two nations often trigger increased cyber activities. The Pakistan Cyber Army (PCA) has been active since at least 2007, targeting high-profile Indian websites, including government and private sector entities. The PCA's operations and motives have been publicly announced, with examples of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) including tutorials on phishing attacks and SQL injection. Indian hacker groups such as the Indian Black Hats and Mallu Cyber Soldiers have also been involved in retaliatory attacks. The article suggests that motivations for these cyber activities range from hacktivist groups to potentially more coordinated state-sponsored attacks. The cyber dimension adds another layer to the historical and ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan."
