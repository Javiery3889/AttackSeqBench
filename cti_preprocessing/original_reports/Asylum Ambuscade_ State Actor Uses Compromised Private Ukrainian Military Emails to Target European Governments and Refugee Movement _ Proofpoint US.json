The campaign is similar to activity observed in July 2021, suggesting the same threat actor, tracked as part of TA445, is behind both. The campaign's focus on European government personnel managing refugee movement aligns with TA445's tactics, including disinformation operations to manipulate European sentiment around refugees. The campaign may be part of a hybrid warfare model employed by the Russian military and Belarus, aiming to gather intelligence and potentially exploit refugee movements for disinformation purposes."
