        "Initial Access": "April 2022 saw an unprecedented attack on government: the Conti ransomware group hit Costa Rican government entities and demanded a ransom of $20 million. With most of the country's IT infrastructure down, a state of emergency was declared. It wasn't long before the Costa Rican healthcare system also came under fire, this time by the Hive group. Lapsus$ targeted Okta, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Samsung. The Lapsus$ data extortion group hacked a number of large tech companies in 2022. At the beginning of the year, it attacked Okta, a major provider of identity and access management solutions, including multifactor authentication. The cyberattack affected 2.5% of Okta's customers and raised doubts about the reliability of its products. In February, Lapsus$ breached the systems of Nvidia, a renowned developer of graphics processing units. The attack resulted in the theft of 1 TB of data, including source code for video cards and software signature certificates. The stolen Nvidia certificates were used by the cybercriminals to distribute malicious software such as backdoors and remote access trojans. In March, Lapsus$ hacked Microsoft and Samsung and made off with the source code of several products.",
