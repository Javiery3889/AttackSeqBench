They have also expanded their toolset to include Android malware, specifically 1PINEFLOWER, which aligns with the capabilities of data exfiltrated from mobile devices.",

This new tactic involves remote template injection to execute a malicious macro, a method not previously associated with this threat actor. The initial documents were hosted on third-party services like Dropbox or AWS, and phishing was likely used to coerce victims into downloading and opening the documents.",
        "Execution": "None",

        "Defense Evasion": "Yellow Garuda's use of macro-enabled template files disrupts analysis efforts by staging various parts of the infection chain remotely. The template files contained RC4-encrypted strings, and the decryption key was obtained via an HTTP GET request to an Amazon S3 bucket. These steps likely thwart analysis if the password to open the document is not available or if the infrastructure hosting the decryption key is inactive.",

They have also used a Telegram 'grabber' tool to exfiltrate information from victims' Telegram accounts, including messages, media, group memberships, and contact data.

An open directory containing several compressed archives associated with Yellow Garuda activity was discovered, revealing a new tool used to enumerate data from targeted Telegram accounts. An alias tied to early Iran-based operations and a surveillance report likely written by a Yellow Garuda operator were also identified. The report provides insight into the threat actor's data collection objectives and internal structure, denoted by numerical call signs, and highlights the alias of an individual linked to Iran-based activity over several years."
