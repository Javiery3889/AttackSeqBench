        "Initial Access": "The CTI report details a new Mirai variant, KiraV2, which exploits vulnerabilities in IoT devices for initial access. It targets devices such as MVPower DVR with JAWS Web Server and Huawei routers by leveraging a remote code execution vulnerability. KiraV2 also retains Mirai's method of using telnet brute-force attacks to compromise devices with weak credentials.",
        "Execution": "KiraV2 malware, an enhanced version of Mirai, executes various DDoS attacks and distributes itself to vulnerable IoT devices. It uses encoded strings for C&C server communication and employs anti-analysis techniques like changing process names and encoding strings to disrupt analysis. The malware also ensures standalone execution by binding to a local port and confirming normal execution by printing a designated string.",
        "Persistence": "KiraV2 employs techniques to prevent system reboots and maintain its presence on infected devices. It deactivates watchdog features on multiple device paths to avoid system resets and periodically resets the watchdog timer to keep the device alive.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "KiraV2 uses anti-analysis techniques such as encoding strings and changing process names to evade detection. It also employs a signal handler registration method to hide the real C&C server address from analysis.",
        "Credential Access": "KiraV2 conducts telnet dictionary attacks using a list of common credentials to gain unauthorized access to IoT devices. It targets environments where telnet is installed and busybox is present, indicating a focus on devices with weak telnet account information.",

        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "None",
        "Command and Control": "KiraV2 communicates with a C&C server using hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers. It periodically communicates with the C&C server to receive commands and execute DDoS attacks.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "KiraV2's primary impact is through DDoS attacks. It supports various types of DDoS attacks, such as UDP flooding and TCP ACK flooding, to disrupt the availability of targeted services and infrastructure.",
        "Others": "The report emphasizes the importance of changing default device credentials and updating IoT devices to the latest versions to prevent vulnerability exploitation. AhnLab's anti-malware product, AhnLab V3, detects Mirai malware under the alias Worm/Linux.Mirai.SE189."
