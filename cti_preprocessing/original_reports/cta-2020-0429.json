The report covers data from September 21, 2019, through March 20, 2020, and identifies emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Chinese state-affiliated or state-friendly actors. Key judgments include the continued role of content farms in Chinese disinformation efforts, the likely employment of AI and bulk social media management software for propagating weaponized content, and the targeting of local collaborators in Taiwan and Hong Kong to increase the authenticity of the information source. The report also highlights the use of crowd-sourced doxxing and social media rallies as new TTPs. The research indicates that Chinese influence operations are evolving with more aggressive tactics that exploit societal weaknesses or manipulate patriotic sentiments. The report anticipates the deployment of more resources and tactics in overseas influence operations, particularly automated content creation and dissemination in local languages during sensitive times such as elections and global events."
