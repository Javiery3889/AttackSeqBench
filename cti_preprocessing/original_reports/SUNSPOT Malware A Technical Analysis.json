        "Execution": "CrowdStrike Intelligence Team reported on January 11, 2021, that SUNSPOT malware was used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds. SUNSPOT was designed to monitor processes involved in the compilation of the Orion product and replace a source file to include the SUNBURST backdoor code. The malware was identified on disk with the filename taskhostsvc.exe and internally named taskhostw.exe by its developers. It was likely built on February 20, 2020, and maintained persistence through a scheduled task set to execute at host boot.",
        "Persistence": "SUNSPOT malware maintains persistence through a scheduled task set to execute when the host boots. This task is triggered at boot time to ensure the malware's continued operation within the compromised system.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "SUNSPOT malware grants itself debugging privileges by modifying its security token to add SeDebugPrivilege, which is a prerequisite for the remainder of its execution, involving reading other processes' memory.",
        "Defense Evasion": "SUNSPOT employs several defense evasion techniques, including the use of AES128-CBC encryption to protect targeted source code files and the backdoored source code file in the binary. It also uses RC4 encryption with a hard-coded key to protect log file entries. The malware masquerades as a legitimate Windows binary and writes its logs in a fake VMWare log file. Additionally, SUNSPOT inserts the backdoor code within #pragma statements to disable and restore warnings, preventing the backdoor code lines from appearing in build logs.",
