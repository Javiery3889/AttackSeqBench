        "Privilege Escalation": "On August 10, 2021, a previously unknown elevation of privilege exploit targeting multiple Microsoft Windows servers was detected by Kaspersky technologies. The exploit, which contained debug strings from an older exploit for CVE-2016-3309, was found to be leveraging a zero-day vulnerability in the Win32k driver. The exploit, identified as CVE-2021-40449, was a use-after-free vulnerability in the Win32k's NtGdiResetDC function. It was patched on October 12, 2021, as part of the October Patch Tuesday. The exploit process, running with Medium IL, used GDI palette objects and a kernel function call to build a primitive for reading and writing kernel memory. Techniques to leak kernel addresses of loaded drivers/modules were employed, which Kaspersky suggested should be limited for Medium IL processes.",

Variants of this malware were detected in espionage campaigns targeting IT companies, military/defense contractors, and diplomatic entities. The RAT was connected to the actor known as IronHusky and Chinese-speaking APT activity dating back to 2012. The RAT, which is not very sophisticated, stands out with a large number of implemented commands and the ability to monitor for inserted disk drives and act as a proxy. It uses SSL for encrypted communication and sends victim machine information to the C2 server. Kaspersky products detect the CVE-2021-40449 exploit and related malware with various verdicts and detected the attacks with the Behavioral Detection Engine and the Exploit Prevention component."
