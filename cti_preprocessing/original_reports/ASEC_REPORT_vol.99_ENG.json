These files were first discovered in mid-2017 and continue to be a threat, targeting public sectors and cryptocurrency-related organizations. The attackers impersonate government institutions or organizations to distribute the malware, which has seen an increase in activity due to the COVID-19 situation, particularly in April 2020.",

This change simplifies the code, making it harder to distinguish from normal EPS files and potentially avoiding detection.",
