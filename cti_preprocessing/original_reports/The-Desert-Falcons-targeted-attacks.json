They also employed social engineering to exploit victims' trust in social networking forums and curiosity about political conflict. Techniques included the rar/lnk trick, right-to-left extension override, and fake RealPlayer plugin trick. Targeted Facebook attacks were conducted through chat, using authentic accounts to gain victims' trust before sending Trojan files disguised as images. Mass infections among activists and political figures were achieved through Facebook posts and redirects to fake pages with political content.",

Campaign 2 targeted victims in Israel, and Campaign 3 focused on activists, political figures, and radio/TV channels in Egypt. The campaigns used homemade backdoors for full access and control, including the Falcons' main Trojan and DHS spyware, which provided functionalities like screenshots, keylogs, file upload/download, password stealing, and audio recording.",

They developed malware targeting Windows and Android devices and used various infection vectors. Victims included military, government, media, financial institutions, research and education institutions, activists, political leaders, energy firms, and physical security companies, mainly located in Egypt, Palestine, Israel, and Jordan. The group stole over one million files containing sensitive information. Kaspersky Lab's investigation led to the identification of some group members, confirming they are native Arabic speakers from the Middle East. The Desert Falcons are expected to continue developing Trojans and using more advanced techniques."
