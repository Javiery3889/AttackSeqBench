        "Resource Development": "None",
        "Initial Access": "The OceanLotus backdoor is distributed via a zip file, presumed to be delivered through an email attachment. The zip file contains a directory with a file disguised as a Microsoft Word document icon, which is actually an application bundle containing executable code. When the user attempts to open the decoy Word document, the Trojan executes and displays a decoy document to mask its execution.",
        "Execution": "The OceanLotus backdoor, once executed, opens a hidden file named .CFUserEncoding, a password-protected Word document, from the application bundle's Resources folder. It also copies this file to the executable path, replacing the application bundle after persistence is established, leading the victim to believe they have opened a legitimate Word document.",
        "Persistence": "The backdoor creates a Launch Agent that runs when the victim's host starts up, differing from the previous version which executed upon user login. It copies itself to a location and filename based on the user's UID, using a segmented MD5 hash as a directory in ~/Library/OpenSSL/ or /Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs for root users. The malware then deletes the original application bundle, leaving the decoy document, and launches itself as a service from the new location.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The backdoor avoids the use of command line utilities and suspicious strings, showing a deep understanding of macOS. It employs a robust string encoding mechanism to obfuscate its functions, making it less suspicious to static analysis. The malware also uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server, an improvement over the previous version's simple XOR encoding.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "The backdoor surveys the victim's computer and sends the information back to the server. It gathers details such as the victim's name, machine serial number, and system information, which is then encrypted and sent to the command and control server.",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "None",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoor communicates with the command and control server using a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443. The communication sequence involves initiating a session, receiving an ephemeral encryption key and command from the server, executing the command, and sending back the results encrypted with AES in CBC mode. The server uses ephemeral keys for each session, enhancing the security of the communication.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The OceanLotus backdoor is an advanced threat targeting victims in Vietnam with low AV detection. It has been active for over a year with recent communication with the command and control server as of early June 2017. The backdoor includes improvements such as a decoy document, custom binary protocol traffic with encryption, and a modularized structure. Apple has updated macOS protection systems to address this variant, and Palo Alto Networks customers are protected with classified samples, malicious domain and IP classifications, and IPS signatures. Indicators of compromise include various hashes, C2 server domains, and dropped files with specific paths based on the user's UID."
