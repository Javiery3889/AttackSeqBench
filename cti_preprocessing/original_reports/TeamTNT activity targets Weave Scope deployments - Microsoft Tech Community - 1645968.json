This image is deployed on Kubernetes clusters and uses a shell script as its entry point, which downloads a coin miner from a server located in Germany. The script then scans for open Docker API endpoints using the masscan tool and deploys the same image on exposed endpoints. Additionally, the script attempts to kill competitor images using docker rm commands.",

The new access vector discovered involves the use of an open Weave Scope service, which is a visualization and monitoring framework for containerized environments. Weave Scope, when exposed to the Internet without authentication, allows attackers to run shell on the pods or nodes in the cluster, leading to compromise.",

ASC provides protection at both the management layer, by detecting exposed sensitive services like Weave Scope, and at the node level, by detecting openly accessible Docker API services and malicious behavior such as cryptocurrency mining activity. Recommendations include using Azure Policy for Kubernetes to restrict and audit sensitive actions and deploying images from trusted registries only."
