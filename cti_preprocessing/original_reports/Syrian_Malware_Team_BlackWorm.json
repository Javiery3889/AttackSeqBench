Another version, BlackWorm Dark Edition (v2.1), was enhanced by an author known as Black.Hacker. The Syrian Malware Team has been active since at least January 1, 2011, with their Facebook page indicating ongoing activity.",

Samples of BlackWorm Dark Edition used by the team often include strings like 'Syrian Malware' or 'Syrian Malware Team' in the C2 communications or binary strings. The malware has been seen communicating with domains associated with Syria, and the use of Arabic strings in the malware suggests targeting specific regions or individuals."
