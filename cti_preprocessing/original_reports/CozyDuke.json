It is executed by the CozyDuke dropper using a copy of rundll32.exe. The entrypoint function varies but is always specified in the dropper configuration.

The toolset includes modules and executables for tasks such as command execution, password stealing, and information collection. CozyDuke uses various user agent strings and mutexes, and a variety of filenames are associated with its activities."
