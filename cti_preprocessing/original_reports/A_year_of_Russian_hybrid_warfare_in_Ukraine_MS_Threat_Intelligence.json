IRIDIUM, a threat actor attributed to Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU), appears to be preparing for a renewed destructive campaign. Microsoft investigations have revealed that cyber threat actors with known or suspected ties to the GRU, Russian Foreign Intelligence (SVR), and Russian Federal Security (FSB) services have attempted to gain initial access to government and defense-related organizations in Central and Eastern Europe and the Americas. Between January and mid-February 2023, Microsoft threat intelligence analysts have found indications of Russian threat activity against organizations in at least 17 European nations, with the government sector the most targeted.",

IRIDIUM has been preparing for a renewed destructive campaign, like its wave of Foxblade and Caddywiper malware deployments against Ukrainian government and media organizations in the early days of the war. As of late 2022, the threat actor may also have been testing additional ransomware-style capabilities that could be used in destructive attacks on organizations outside Ukraine that serve key functions in Ukraine's supply lines. The Prestige ransomware operation against a Polish firm in late 2022 provides a precedent for such attacks."
