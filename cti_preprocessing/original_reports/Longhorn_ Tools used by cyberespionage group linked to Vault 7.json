On one occasion, a computer in the United States was compromised but an uninstaller was launched within hours, indicating an unintentional infection. Longhorn's operations were first noticed by Symantec in 2014 when a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document was used to infect a target with Plexor malware.",

They employ practices such as wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, using a unique deployment-time key for string obfuscation, and secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting. Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to stay under the radar.",

        "Command and Control": "Longhorn configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering VPS or web hosting services. The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification.",

Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, as well as targets in various sectors. Symantec has found evidence of Longhorn activities against 40 targets in 16 countries. The group uses preconfigured malware with target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses. Longhorn operates with a high degree of operational security and appears to work a standard Monday to Friday working week, with indicators suggesting it is from an English-speaking, North American country."
