This backdoor was disguised as a document error message but contained a module that connected to a command server. The Hellsing group also used other tools for information gathering and lateral movement, such as 'test.exe' for testing proxies and 'xKat.exe' for file deletion and process killing. Additionally, the group deployed a file system driver named 'diskfilter.sys' for a brief period in 2013. The Hellsing group's activities were mainly focused on the South China Sea area, targeting Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The group's malware was compiled in a time zone of GMT+8 or +9, suggesting an active work schedule in that region. Kaspersky Lab products detect the backdoors used by the Hellsing attacker as HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic, Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.kbuj, and Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.kzqq."
