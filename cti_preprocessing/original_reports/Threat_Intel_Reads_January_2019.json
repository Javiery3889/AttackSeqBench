Lee's case study on the Tribune Publishing cyber attack, Politico's report on the NSA hacking-tools leak probe, and Maarten Goet's discussion on Windows Defender ATP for threat hunting. The APT Chronicles and a mass data attack on German politicians highlight ongoing cyber threats. The first-ever UEFI rootkit linked to the Sednit APT and the TaHiTI Threat Hunting Methodology offer technical perspectives, while the German suspect's confession to a mass hack and Huawei's suspected front companies in Iran and Syria raise geopolitical concerns. The EU's bug bounties on open-source software, a Russian firm's role in catching an alleged NSA data thief, and FireEye's report on a global DNS hijacking campaign underscore the international dimension of cyber threats. The vulnerability of America's electric grid to Russian intrusion and the Singapore Health Services cyber attack inquiry report reflect the critical nature of infrastructure security. Discussions on cyber deterrence, a year of cyber attacks, and the Ryuk ransomware demonstrate the evolving landscape of cyber threats. The arrest of Huawei employees in Poland for spying, the NotPetya ransomware insurance claim, and insights into the exploit industry's operational security reveal the complexity of attribution and response. The history of Iran's first security forum, the SEC hacking and securities fraud scheme, and the European R&D priorities in cybersecurity highlight the importance of intelligence and research in combating cybercrime. The DarkHydrus APT's use of Google Drive for command and control, MITRE's ATT&CK framework, and the need for finished intelligence in executive protection emphasize the technical and strategic aspects of CTI. The Global Risks Report 2019, the curious case of a Raspberry Pi in a network closet, and the fight against cybercrime through CSIRTs and law enforcement cooperation illustrate the broad implications of cybersecurity. The DNS hijacking emergency order, Exchange Online attacker activity, and the importance of post-exploitation knowledge reflect the ongoing efforts to secure digital environments. The French doctrine of offensive cyber operations, the global APT summary report, and the Triton/Trisis attack's wider impact show the continuous development of cyber warfare tactics. The UAE's Karma Hack and Project Raven, the SANS CTI Summit, and the S4 ICS Detection Challenge provide case studies and educational resources for CTI professionals. Overall, the articles and presentations from January 2019 offer a comprehensive view of the current state of cyber threat intelligence, highlighting the need for vigilance, collaboration, and continuous learning in the field."
