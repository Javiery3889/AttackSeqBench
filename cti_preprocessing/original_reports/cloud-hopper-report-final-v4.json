        "Initial Access": "APT10, a China-based threat actor, has been observed using spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to compromise targets. These emails often contain decoy documents relevant to the recipient's interests, indicating significant target research. For example, an official document from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science was weaponized and used in a campaign against the Japanese education sector.",
        "Execution": "APT10 deploys malware to establish a foothold on a target network, using tools like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for long-term remote access. The actor performs internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools. APT10 ensures access to legitimate credentials, often using the MSPs credentials, and deploys credential theft tools such as mimikatz or PwDump. The actor installs updates and new malware on compromised systems, using methods like reverse shell or RDP connections to propagate across the network.",
        "Persistence": "APT10 achieves persistence on victim networks primarily through scheduled tasks or Windows services, ensuring malware remains active despite system reboots. The actor targets both high-value systems for access and low-profile systems less likely to draw attention for long-term access.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions on compromised systems. The actor has been observed using stolen MSP credentials to gain administrator or domain administrator privileges.",
        "Defense Evasion": "APT10 has evolved from using malware associated with China-based threat actors to developing bespoke in-house malware like ChChes and RedLeaves. The actor also uses open-source malware like Quasar and extends its capabilities. APT10 uses DLL search order hijacking and sideloading to execute modified versions of open-source tools.",
        "Credential Access": "APT10 deploys tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials, often using DLL load order hijacking to execute against a domain controller.",
        "Discovery": "APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and later stages using open-source pentesting tools.",
        "Lateral Movement": "APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims. The actor uses systems that share access and credentials to gain access to new areas of the network.",
        "Collection": "APT10 identifies systems of interest and stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives, often placed in the Recycle Bin, using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts.",
        "Command and Control": "APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains for command and control infrastructure, which are highly interconnected and link back to the actor's previous operations. The actor uses legitimate Robocopy tool and Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP) to transfer data for command and control.",
        "Exfiltration": "APT10 'pushes' data from victim networks to other networks they have access to, such as other MSP or victim networks, then 'pulls' the data to locations from which they can directly obtain it, such as the threat actor's C2 servers.",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "APT10, a China-based threat actor, has been active since at least 2009, evolving its targeting from the US defense industrial base and technology sectors to a global compromise of multiple industries. The actor has increased its scale and capability since early 2016, adding new custom tools and significantly increasing the number of dynamic-DNS domains used for operations. APT10's activities align with China Standard Time and its targeting corresponds with strategic Chinese interests. The actor's campaigns, including Operation Cloud Hopper, have targeted managed IT service providers (MSPs) and Japanese organizations, focusing on espionage and sensitive data collection. APT10's methodology includes spear phishing, use of bespoke and open-source malware, and leveraging MSP infrastructure for lateral movement and data exfiltration."
