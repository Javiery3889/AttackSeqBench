The GHOLE malware is a modified version of the CORE IMPACT penetration-testing tool. Metadata analysis of malicious files revealed authors such as Wool3n.H4t, aikido1, and Hoffman. Wool3n.H4t, who is likely part of the threat actor group, was also found to be a malware developer responsible for the CWoolger keylogger. The group's activities suggest a state-sponsored campaign with interests aligned with the Islamic Republic of Iran."
