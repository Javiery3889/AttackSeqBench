The group is known for using an unlimited number of zero-day exploits and has been linked to the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse attack on Google in 2009. The attackers have developed an attack platform, termed the 'Elderwood platform,' which allows them to quickly deploy zero-day exploits. The group's systematic approach and reuse of components indicate a high level of technical capability, suggesting the backing of a large criminal organization, nation-state support, or a nation-state itself. The Elderwood gang has been responsible for compromising numerous websites, corporations, and individuals, focusing on the wholesale theft of intellectual property. Symantec has provided various protection measures against these threats, including file-based protection, network-based protection, behavior-based protection, reputation-based protection, and email-based protection."
