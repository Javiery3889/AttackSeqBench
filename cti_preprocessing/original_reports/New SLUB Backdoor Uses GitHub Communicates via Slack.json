Chen, reported on March 7, 2019, about a new malware spread via watering hole attacks. The attackers compromised a website and added code to redirect visitors to the infecting code, exploiting CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript engine vulnerability patched by Microsoft in May 2018.",
        "Execution": "The malware executes a multi-stage infection process. Initially, it exploits the VBScript engine vulnerability to download a DLL, which is then run in PowerShell. This downloader checks for antivirus software processes and exits if any are found. It also exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation. The second stage involves downloading and executing a backdoor, named SLUB (for SLack and githUB; detected as Backdoor.Win32.SLUB.A).",
        "Persistence": "The SLUB backdoor achieves persistence by copying itself to ProgramData\\update\\ and creating a Run registry key with a typo in the ValueName, 'Microsoft Setup Initializazion', to call the export function UpdateMPUnits with rundll32.exe.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "The downloader exploits the CVE-2015-1701 vulnerability to acquire Local Privilege Escalation, likely by modifying code from a GitHub repository.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The first stage downloader exits if it detects any antivirus software processes, indicating an evasion tactic to avoid detection by security software.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "The SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute. It looks for lines starting with '^' and ending with '$', ignoring other lines. The backdoor also retrieves the username and computer name as part of its discovery process.",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "The backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website. It also collects information from registry keys and creates archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack, using two hardcoded authentication tokens to post messages and command results to a private Slack channel. It also uses the Slack API to post messages.",
        "Exfiltration": "The attackers exfiltrate data by uploading files to the file.io website and posting download links to the Slack channel. They also create archive files of user's Desktop folders and build CAB files containing the file tree for exfiltration.",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The attackers' tools, techniques, and procedures indicate a stealthy targeted attack by capable actors. The GitHub account and Slack workspace were created specifically for the campaign, and the malware was compiled shortly after. The attackers tested the malware and began observing victims within days. They showed a strong interest in person-related information, focusing on communication software to learn more about the people behind the infected computers. The attackers used public third-party services to leave a clean footprint and targeted groups and individuals interested in political activities. Trend Micro informed the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, which helped mitigate the attack. Slack and GitHub's security teams removed the related files, cutting off communication between the attackers and their malware."
