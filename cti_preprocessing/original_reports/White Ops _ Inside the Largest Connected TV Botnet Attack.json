Because of this opportunity,it is incredibly important for the CTV ecosystem and brands to work together through a collectivelyprotected advertising supply chain to ensure fraud is recognized, addressed and eliminated asquickly as possible as bad actors always follow the money. Ad fraud can happen when you buyinventory through unprotected channels. Ad fraud can be eliminated quickly through protectedchannels where there are direct relationships, trust, and full transparency. Working togetherthrough a collectively protected supply chain will ensure the ecosystem realizes the full bene\ncial benefits ofcreating a great CTV customer experience that is ad fraud free.\n\nA new CTV ad fraud operation\ncalled ICEBUCKET\ncame to light, targeting less transparent segments of programmatic advertising where sellers are not reported in sellers.json \nles, and buyers and sellers typically don't have a direct relationship. The bad actors behind ICEBUCKET expanded their efforts to include partners protected by White Ops. However, the attack was blocked by collaborating with partners, sharing data across the network, and enhancing the platform's efficacy to stay ahead of ad fraud.\n\nThe White Ops Satori Threat Intelligence and Research team uncovered the largest and widest Connected TV (CTV) related fraud operation to date, named ICEBUCKET. At its peak, ICEBUCKET impersonated over 2 million people in more than 30 countries, counterfeiting over 300 publishers to steal advertising spend by simulating real viewership. The operation utilized server-side ad insertion (SSAI) to hide its sophisticated bots within video ad impressions. The White Ops Bot Mitigation Platform detected and protected partners from this operation.\n\nThe ICEBUCKET operation, the largest case of SSAI spoofing uncovered, accounted for nearly 28% of the programmatic CTV traffic White Ops had visibility into, or around 1.9 billion ad requests per day in January 2020. The operation used over 1,000 different user-agents, around 500 of which were unique to this operation, more than 300 different appIDs from various publishers, and at least 2 million spoofed IP addresses from over 30 countries, with over 99% located in the United States. About 1,700 SSAI server IPs in 9 countries generated the traffic.\n\nSSAI spoofing, the key fraud technique used by ICEBUCKET, involves sending ad requests from data centers for fake edge devices, with the data center source expected for real SSAI providers. Instead of displaying ads to humans, the fraudsters report the ads as shown. Advertisers' information in an SSAI environment is often limited to device user-agent and IP address, which fraudsters can easily falsify.\n\nThe ICEBUCKET operation presented its traffic as coming from a legitimate SSAI provider, using custom code to assemble ad requests for non-existent CTV and mobile device viewers. The operation targeted obsolete or non-existent device types and algorithmically generated IP addresses to mimic desirable audiences. The traffic originated from a small set of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) with weak enforcement against malicious activity, cheap VPS services, and a large number of vulnerable hosts.\n\nA subset of the ICEBUCKET traffic was generated to benefit app publishers directly through direct deals, indicating possible traffic sourcing schemes for CTV traffic. The operation's traffic was mixed with organic traffic, making it harder to detect and potentially serving as a fraud-as-a-service model.\n\nWhite Ops' Bot Mitigation Platform stops sophisticated bots by monitoring for threat signatures in pre-bid traffic, blocking fraudulent traffic, and highlighting vulnerable parts of the ad-tech ecosystem. The platform's detection and prevention techniques continually evolve to counter and anticipate threats.\n\nThe industry can mitigate SSAI spoofing by working with a protected advertising supply chain, maintaining consistent appID/bundleID declarations, consulting with ad tech partners, and developing standards to increase CTV inventory transparency. Device manufacturers and SSAI providers should support standards that verify device authenticity to combat impersonation.\n\nWhite Ops' Advertising Integrity offering protects advertisers from sophisticated bot attacks, and education on SSAI spoofing is crucial for monitoring and establishing industry standards to combat fraud.\n\nAppendix\n\nSubset of ASNs identified as the traffic sources for this operation:\n\nNot all traffic from these ASNs are part of the ICEBUCKET operation, as there is non-ICEBUCKET traffic from these ASNs as well.\n\nUser-agents present: icebucket-uas.txt\n\nNot all of the included user-agents are unique to the ICEBUCKET operation. Since the operation is trying to look like legitimate traffic, there are some devices represented here that will be seen outside of this operation."
