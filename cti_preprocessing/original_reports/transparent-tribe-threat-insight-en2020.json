The investigation began with malicious emails and uncovered connections to watering hole sites designed to drop a remote access Trojan (RAT) with data exfiltration functions. The campaigns and attacks appear related by common indicators of compromise (IOCs), vectors, payloads, and language. The exact nature and attribution of this APT remain under investigation. The MSIL/Crimson malware family is modular, with additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module often utilized for functions such as keylogging and browser credential theft. Infections typically occur in stages, with the first stage being a downloader component. Crimson-infected victims may be spied on via invasive methods such as through their webcam, stealing email from Outlook, and recording their screen. Some variants support at least 40 individual commands. The technical analysis section provides a full description and analysis of the MSIL/Crimson malware family."
