The report predicts persistent attacks on healthcare providers and vaccine makers, the growth of ransomware, and nation-state activities led by countries like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. It also highlights the increasing importance of cloud security and the need for security validation to ensure effective cyber defenses and budget optimization. The report acknowledges the challenges faced in 2020 and the likelihood of these continuing into 2021, with ransomware becoming a significant threat. It suggests that organizations prepare for such attacks with incident response plans and data backups. Additionally, the report foresees an increase in spear phishing and other attacks from nation-states seeking espionage opportunities. The report concludes by stressing the need for organizations to catch up on cloud security and consider managed security validation to optimize security and reduce spending."
