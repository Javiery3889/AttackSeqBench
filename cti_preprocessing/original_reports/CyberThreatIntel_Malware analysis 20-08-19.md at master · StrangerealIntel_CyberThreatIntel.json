The domain used for C2 was based in Canada and hosted by the cloud provider GoDaddy, with registration information indicating Chinese provenance. The campaign was linked to Chinese APT groups following the U.S. National Security Advisor's visit to Mongolia. The documents used were compilations of multiple documents about national security concepts available on the web. Other samples targeted the Jaish group, which had recently infiltrated Kashmir. Pakistan and China cooperated against the Jaish Association, leading to cyberattacks and military deployments observed by d-atis between Pakistan, India, and China over the past two months. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were provided, including file hashes, an IP address (167.88.180.148), and a domain (www.apple-net.com) associated with the C2 infrastructure."
