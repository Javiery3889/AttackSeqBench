GandCrab, which was active from January 2018 to May 2019, specifically targeted AhnLab's anti-malware program, V3 Lite, by attempting to delete it and exploiting its vulnerabilities. AhnLab responded by analyzing GandCrab's code, encryption, and evasion methods, and continuously updated their defenses to protect against the ransomware's evolving tactics.\n\nThe report chronicles the adversarial relationship, including GandCrab's direct mentions of AhnLab in its code and the use of profanity against the company. AhnLab's efforts to thwart GandCrab included releasing a kill-switch, analyzing new versions of the ransomware, and implementing CAPTCHA to prevent automated deletion of their software. The conflict culminated in GandCrab's announcement of the end of its operations on May 31st, 2019, after claiming to have made substantial profits.\n\nThe report emphasizes the importance of collaboration between security vendors and organizations to combat advanced threats like GandCrab RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) and the need for continuous monitoring and resilience in cybersecurity.\n\nAdditionally, the report delves into user-mode hooking bypass techniques used by malware to evade detection by behavioral-based engines within sandboxes or anti-malware solutions. It explains various methods employed by malware, such as checking if the ntdll file is hooked, reloading the ntdll file, and directly calling system calls. The report provides examples of malware samples that utilize these techniques, including Parasite HTTP, SmokeLoader, AgentTesla Packer, Lokibot Packer, Ave_maria Packer, Formbook, Miner, BlueCrab, and Trickbot, detailing the specific APIs and processes involved in each method."
