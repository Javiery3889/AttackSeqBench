These domains were linked through common passwords, CnC domain names, and IP addresses. The CnC servers shifted to new IP addresses over time, with observed addresses including 209.200.39.48, 209.200.39.88, 173.225.126.166, 173.225.126.103, and 209.200.39.220.",

The attackers used various RATs, including XtremeRAT and Poison Ivy (PIVY), and leveraged Arabic-language content related to conflicts in the Middle East to lure targets. The campaign was linked to the Gaza Hackers Team and used PIVY samples with common passwords and CnC infrastructure. The use of PIVY, typically associated with Chinese threat actors, suggests a potential attempt to misattribute the campaign or simply the adoption of an effective RAT. The campaign's activities are expected to continue, leveraging regional conflicts for operational purposes."
