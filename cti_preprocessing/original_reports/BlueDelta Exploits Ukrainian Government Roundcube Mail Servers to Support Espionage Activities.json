The campaign exploited vulnerabilities CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2020-12641, and CVE-2021-44026 in Roundcube webmail software to run reconnaissance and exfiltration scripts. These scripts were designed to redirect incoming emails to an actor-controlled email address, perform reconnaissance on the target Roundcube server, and exfiltrate the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book, along with session and user information from Roundcube's database.",

This was achieved without the need for recipients to engage with the email attachment. The campaign also exploited the Microsoft Outlook zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-23397 in 2022, which did not require user interaction and was triggered once the vulnerable Outlook client received the malicious email.",
        "Execution": "The BlueDelta campaign executed malicious scripts through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software. The scripts redirected victims' future incoming emails to an actor-controlled email address and performed reconnaissance on the target Roundcube server.
