On September 19, 2018, they successfully installed backdoors on several machines belonging to financial institutions. These backdoors, identified as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A, were installed as services and are capable of executing various malicious functions such as collecting information, downloading files, launching or terminating processes, updating configuration data, deleting files, injecting code, utilizing proxies, opening reverse shells, and running in passive mode to receive commands through an open port.",

They employ a complex technique involving three major components: a loader DLL (AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll), an encrypted backdoor (Msadoz<n>.dll), and an encrypted configuration file (Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui). The loader DLL is installed as a service and is responsible for loading the encrypted backdoor to decrypt and execute it in memory. The encrypted configuration file contains the C&C information necessary for the backdoor to connect and conduct its activities. The backdoors are located in different directories, making it harder to detect and remove them.",
