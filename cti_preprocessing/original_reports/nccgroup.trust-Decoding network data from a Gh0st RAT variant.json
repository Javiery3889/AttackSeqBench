Both tools could listen on given ports, but only 'Mozilla' could connect to a bind port. The tools supported SSL and TCP, with a protocol named 'WINNET' not yet supported, suggesting ongoing development. The 'Mozilla' tool relied heavily on plugins, allowing the attacker to load new plugins to the infected machine. A Program database (PDB) path was found inside the binary of the 'Mozilla' tool. Malicious files were found in directories C:\\ProgramData\\HIDMgr, C:\\ProgramData\\Rascon, and C:\\ProgramData\\TrkSvr, with service names HIDMgr, RasconMan, and TrkSvr. File names and hashes were provided for various malicious executables and DLLs."
