When the infected device is connected to another computer, the worm duplicates itself onto the new system and downloads additional malicious code.",

The ban is a significant inconvenience due to the military's reliance on such devices for information storage, especially in bandwidth-scarce and network-unreliable environments. Government security teams are tasked with conducting daily scans and running custom scripts to ensure no commercial malware has been introduced. Any discovery of malware will lead to a security incident report and further action by the appropriate security officer. The ban is expected to be effective in stopping the worm's spread, although it is acknowledged as a serious threat affecting global operations and is considered a form of attack."
