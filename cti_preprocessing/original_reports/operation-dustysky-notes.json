        "Others": "Operation DustySky NotesEarlier this morning, Eyal from Clearsky Cyber Security published a paper on \"OperationDustySky\", a set of targeted campaigns attributed back to the Gaza Cybergang. Whenworking with Clearsky, we observed some interesting details and overlap that didn't quitefit in the paper, so we wanted to publish them here.\n\n72.11.148.14772.11.148.147\n\nWe found this IP address to be interesting due to the SSL certificate, mix of dynamic DNSand registered domains and recent activity.\n\nBased on the heatmap above, a user can easily identify that traffic to this particular IP isfairly new (showing in mid-December). What's worth noting is that the first day starts withjust one resolution, followed by 17 and then 24. Those first 3 days appears to besignificant as newly observed domains (notated by the orange flag) are seen and then it'snothing new over the next few weeks.\n\nThe certificate for this domain is interesting, but does not appear to lead to any newdiscoveries. Clicking on \"Serial Number\", \"Common Name\" and \"SHA-1\" do not revealanymore new IP discoveries or overlap.\n\n192.161.48.59192.161.48.59\n\nThis IP address is interesting because of the SSL certificates, but mainly due to someoverlap with Gaza Cybergang and a strange pattern in the domain changes.\n\nIn this heatmap, you can see a clear change from Dynamic/Registered infrastructure tojust dynamic infrastructure in the past ~2.5 weeks. While this may not be significant, it'sworth noting and should be investigated or compared to attack times. Did attackers stopon the same day they switched to dynamic DNS only? Was this infrastructure usedagain?\n\nAbove is a screenshot of the results table from update.ciscofreak.com which used the192.161.48.59 address back in April of this year. It's worth noting that based on thePassiveTotal OSINT tags, you can see that Kaspersky had reported on the GazaCybergang for the IP address 172.227.95.162 which resolved at the same time. Whiletime periods may not overlap completely (was 192.161.48.59 used for malicious purposesin April?), it's still worth investigating.\n\n172.227.95.162172.227.95.162\n\nThis IP address was reported by Kaspersky as being linked to Gaza Cybergang andshows overlap to the DustySky infrastructure in April of this year. Looking at the results,it's interesting that it seems to show a similar pattern of dynamic/registered domains andthen a sudden shift to dynamic DNS only.\n\nThe results seem to show more potential links to malicious activity with dynamic DNSdomains not mentioned in reporting being shown. Due to the dynamic DNS nature,there's a good chance these are not related or may no longer be malicious, but they stillhave recent activity that could be used as a research point.\n\nAlso, worth showing that there's an SSL certificate associated with the IP address fromOctober of last year. It's a wildcard certificate that shows a relation to Quantas AirwaysLimited giving us a timeframe that the current holders appear to be non-malicious and thatstarted around October. Anything before that period could be suspect. Also, it's strangethat those Dynamic DNS domains continue to point to the IP despite being owned by areal service. Did the attackers abandon their infrastructure?\n\n45.32.13.16945.32.13.169\n\nThis IP address shows a connection to the following SSL certificate starting in October of2015.\n\nWhile not incredibly unique, the common name of the certificate is interesting. Looking foropen source data doesn't reveal any connections to malware, but the domain itself isstrange and a good point to pivot off of.\n\nClicking the subject name reveals quite a lot of other IP addresses that used a certificatewith the same name roughly around the same 6 month time period in 2015. Many ofthese appear to be dead-ends, but 131.72.136.124 shows some domains associated withit that have OSINT hits associating back to PWC reporting on Middle Eastern actors usingxtremeRAT and Poison Ivy and Kaspersky Gaza Cybergang.\n\nThe above results for 131.72.136.124 show yet again, an interesting change of dynamicand registered domains and then going to dynamic only in the past few weeks. Unlikely acorrelation, but interesting nonetheless. The OSINT data is clearly seen by the tags onwithin the result table.\n\nCo.vuCo.vu\n\nIt's valuable to dig into the co.vu usage a bit more for these actors. Going to the serviceswebsite reveals a dynamic-like service in which users can obfuscate their Tumblr orBlogger blog using a co.vu address.\n\nRegistering for free gives users 3 free domains they can use. Given these co.vuaddresses are being used in attacks, it's worth identifying the importance of the domains.Are they being used for command and control or phishing landing pages or exploitdelivery? The obfuscation on top of an already 3rd-party service shows signs thatattackers are looking to hide their tracks or complicate analysis.\n\nShare this postShare this post\n\nTagsTags\n\nresearch\nclearsky\n"
