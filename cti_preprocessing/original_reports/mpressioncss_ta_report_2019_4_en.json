In December 2019, media companies received spear phishing emails disguised as New Year's greetings, which delivered the LODEINFO malware when the embedded macro was activated. In January 2020, defense-related organizations were targeted with spear phishing emails carrying an Office macro file designed to drop LODEINFO malware.",
        "Execution": "The version RAT malware, developed to run only in a Windows 10 environment, includes remote-controlled functions such as execution of a remote shell, file uploading, and file downloading. LODEINFO malware operates by injecting malicious code into a svchost.exe process and possesses a command set similar to Unix commands.",
