This marks a shift from TA505's typical phishing-based methods to exploiting software vulnerabilities for initial access. SolarWinds released a security advisory on July 9, 2021, and Microsoft reported on July 13, 2021, that the vulnerability was being exploited by a different threat actor, DEV-0322. TA505's exploitation of the vulnerability allows them to control a subprocess of Serv-U, enabling further penetration into the network.",
        "Execution": "TA505 utilized Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on systems running the vulnerable Serv-U software.

        "Persistence": "TA505 attempted to maintain access by hijacking a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup and altering the COM handler associated with it to execute the FlawedGrace RAT. The legitimate CLSID for the COM handler is {CA767AA8-9157-4604-B64B-40747123D5F2}, but TA505 changed it to a different CLSID, which redirected to another CLSID containing three objects with the FlawedGrace RAT loader encoded in Base64.",

NCC Group mapped the internet for vulnerable servers and found a significant number still at risk, with the top vulnerable versions listed. The top countries with potentially vulnerable servers include China, the United States, Canada, and others. The MITRE ATT&CK mapping for TA505's activities includes T1190 for Initial Access, T1059.001 for Execution, T1053.005 for Persistence, and T1112 for Defense Evasion."
