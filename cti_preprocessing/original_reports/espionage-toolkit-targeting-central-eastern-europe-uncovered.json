        "Initial Access": "The SBDH toolkit, identified by ESET, was distributed via phishing emails with executable attachments that had double extensions, relying on Windows' default behavior of hiding extensions. The executables used legitimate-looking icons of Microsoft applications or Word documents to increase the likelihood of execution by the recipient.",
        "Execution": "Upon execution, the SBDH malware contacts a remote server to download two main components: a backdoor and a data stealer. These components allow the attacker to gain full remote control of the compromised computer and implement advanced data exfiltration methods.",
        "Persistence": "The SBDH malware employs a unique persistence technique by replacing the handler for Word documents, ensuring that the malware is executed whenever a Word document is opened or edited on the infected system.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "To avoid detection, the SBDH malware uses various communication methods with its command and control (C&C) server, including HTTP and SMTP protocols, and injecting emails into Microsoft Outlook Express. It also camouflages communications with the C&C server using fake image files (.JPG, .GIF) to carry data. In case of C&C server unavailability, a backup solution involves a hard-coded URL pointing to a fake image that contains the address of an alternative C&C server.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "None",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "The SBDH malware includes powerful filters that allow the operator to specify in detail which data should be exfiltrated, based on conditions such as file extension, creation date, and file size. These filters can be modified via the malware configuration files.",
        "Command and Control": "The SBDH malware relies on network communication with its C&C server, using multiple methods for connection. It first attempts to use the HTTP protocol, then SMTP protocol via a free external gateway, and as a last resort, it communicates by injecting specially crafted emails into Microsoft Outlook Express. Incoming communications are searched in the victim's inbox for emails with a specific subject, which are then parsed for malware commands and have their subjects changed to prevent further examination by the malware.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The SBDH toolkit was presented at the Copenhagen Cybercrime Conference 2016 by ESET researchers Tom\u00e1\u0161 Gardo\u0148 and Robert Lipovsk\u00fd. The toolkit targets governmental and public institutions in Central and Eastern Europe, focusing on economic growth and cooperation. The name 'SBDH' was found in the compilation paths of its downloader, and the string 'B64SBDH' acts as a trigger to download its remaining components from a remote server. The toolkit's techniques are similar to those used in Operation Buhtrap, demonstrating that advanced threats are still spread via simple vectors like malicious email attachments. Properly trained staff and multi-layered security solutions can mitigate such risks."
