Just like the coronavirus itself, China was the first target of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, and as the virus spread worldwide, so did the cyberattacks.\n\nOnce their victims' attention was captured by social engineering, threat actors used various techniques to deploy malware, such as embedding macros in Microsoft documents attached to phishing emails or exploiting system or browser vulnerabilities to drop malicious software.",
