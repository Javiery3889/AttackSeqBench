The group targeted organizations by using a Mongolian language decoy document referencing the Ministry of Justice and Internal Affairs of Mongolia. The document was uploaded from a Singapore IP address and was designed to drop first-stage malware if the exploit was successful.",
        "Execution": "The first-stage malware, identified as RasTls.dll, begins by resolving encoded API addresses and then starts a thread to poll for the presence of a debugger, exiting if one is found. It uses a custom hashing algorithm to check the process name it is running under against a list of expected names, including 'winword.exe', 'excel.exe', 'powerpnt.exe', 'acrord32.exe', and 'eqnedt32.exe'. The malware also runs CreateProcess with commands to manipulate file ownership and drops batch files to delete the initial malware file and winword.exe.",
        "Persistence": "The malware achieves persistence by decompressing and dropping two files: RasTls.dll (renamed from cclerr.wll) and IntelGraphicsController.exe/AcroRd32.exe, which is a legitimate signed Symantec file (real name: dot1xtra.exe). These files are stored in directories related to Intel Processor Graphics and are added to the registry run keys for persistence. The registry key used is 'IntelGraphicsController' with a specific value format.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including checking for debuggers, process name hashing, and process injection. It also uses timestomping to modify the timestamps of its dropped files to approximate those of kernel32.dll. Additionally, the malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable file to avoid detection.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "The malware performs discovery by querying the registry and identifying victim machines using a specific registry key under 'Software\\Intel\\Java'. It also checks for the presence of certain processes on the system.",
