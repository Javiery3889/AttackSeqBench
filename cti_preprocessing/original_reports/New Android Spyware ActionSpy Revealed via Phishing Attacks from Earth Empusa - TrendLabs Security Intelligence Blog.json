        "Reconnaissance": "The Earth Empusa group, also known as POISON CARP/Evil Eye, was observed using phishing attacks to deliver the ActionSpy malware. They targeted users in Tibet and Turkey before extending their scope to Taiwan. The campaign targeted victims related to Uyghurs by compromising their Android and iOS mobile devices. The group is known for using watering hole attacks, but phishing attacks have been recently observed. In April 2020, a phishing page disguised as a download page for a popular Android video application in Tibet was found, which may have been created by Earth Empusa. The page contained malicious scripts hosted on a domain belonging to the group.",
        "Resource Development": "None",
        "Initial Access": "The phishing page invited users to download a video app known to Tibetan Android users. The download link was modified to an archive file containing the Android application, which was an undocumented Android spyware named ActionSpy.",
        "Execution": "ActionSpy is an Android spyware that impersonates a legitimate Uyghur video app called Ekran. It uses VirtualApp to achieve the same appearance and features as the original app and is protected by Bangcle to evade static analysis and detection. ActionSpy collects basic device information every 30 seconds and sends it to the C&C server as a heartbeat request.",
        "Persistence": "ActionSpy prompts users to turn on its Accessibility service, claiming it is a memory garbage cleaning service. Once enabled, ActionSpy monitors Accessibility events on the device to steal chat log files from messaging apps like WeChat, QQ, WhatsApp, and Viber indirectly.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "ActionSpy is protected by Bangcle to evade static analysis and detection. Its configuration, including the C&C server address, is encrypted by DES, with the decryption key generated in native code, making static analysis difficult.",
        "Credential Access": "ActionSpy abuses the Android Accessibility service to collect chat logs from instant messaging applications by monitoring Accessibility events and parsing the current activity contents to extract information like nicknames, chat contents, and chat time.",
        "Discovery": "None",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "ActionSpy supports modules for collecting various types of data, including device location, contacts, call logs, SMS messages, browser bookmarks, installed app info, running processes, Wi-Fi hotspots info, files on SDCard, and chat logs from WeChat, QQ, WhatsApp, and Viber.",
        "Command and Control": "All communication traffic between the C&C and ActionSpy is encrypted by RSA and transferred via HTTP. The C&C server may return commands to be performed on the compromised device.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "Earth Empusa also employs watering hole attacks to compromise iOS devices by injecting malicious scripts on websites that targets could potentially visit. The group uses the ScanBox framework to collect information from a website's visitors and an exploit chain framework to exploit vulnerabilities on iOS devices. In the first quarter of 2020, the exploit chain framework was upgraded to include a newer iOS exploit that can compromise iOS versions 12.3, 12.3.1, and 12.3.2."
