The report assesses that political, economic, and other forces contributed to a shift in Chinese cyber operations before the Xi-Obama agreement in September 2015. A decline in network compromises by China-based groups against the U.S. and 25 other countries began in mid-2014, coinciding with China's political and military reforms, exposure of Chinese cyber activities, and U.S. government actions. The report details various incidents of network compromise and spear-phishing activities targeting corporations and government entities in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and countries surrounding China from late 2015 to mid-2016. It also discusses the complexity of attributing cyber activity to specific groups and the range of state direction or support they may receive. The report concludes that the changes in China-based cyber operations are attributed to multiple factors, including President Xi's initiatives, exposure of operations, and U.S. pressure, leading to a more complex and diverse landscape of cyber threats."
