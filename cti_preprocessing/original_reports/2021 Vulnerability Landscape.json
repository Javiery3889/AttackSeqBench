        "Others": "February 10, 2022By Insikt Group2021 Vulnerability LandscapeCYBERTHREATANALYSIS Several of these vulnerabilities were initially exploited in zero-day attacks, as they had already been targeted prior to discovery and disclosure, or in N-day attacks, in which the vulnerability is known but a patch is unavailable. In addition, shortly after vulnerability disclosures, threat groups hastily targeted vulnerable systems to deploy post-exploitation malware and malicious tools. Contrary to our findings in previous years (2020, 2019, 2018), none of the top exploited vulnerabilities of 2021 were recycled vulnerabilities disclosed in prior years. Rather, the notable trend in 2021 vulnerability exploitation on the criminal underground was how quickly threat actors have begun exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities in the wild and deploying post-exploitation tools. The annual vulnerability report surveys the threat landscape of 2021, summarizing a year of intelligence produced by Recorded Future's threat research team, Insikt Group. It draws from data on the Recorded Future Platform, including open sources like media outlets and publicly available research from other security groups, as well as closed sources on the criminal underground, to analyze global trends and evaluate the top 10 most significant vulnerability disclosures from 2021. The report will be of interest to anyone seeking a broad, holistic view of the cyber vulnerability threat landscape in 2021. The 2021 vulnerability threat landscape was defined by high-profile incidents involving integral vendor software that led to widespread data breaches and malware attacks. With timing reminiscent of the SolarWinds Orion SUNBURST backdoor disclosure in December 2020, the most serious vulnerability of 2021, commonly known as Log4Shell and tracked as CVE-2021-44228, was first publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. Other major vulnerabilities throughout the year were identified affecting Microsoft Exchange and Windows Print Spoolers, VMware vCenter, legacy Accellion FTA, and the IT management company Kaseya's Virtual System Administrator. Each of these critical vulnerabilities were exploited by criminal and state-sponsored threat actors in compromises including data breaches and ransomware attacks that had far-reaching consequences for vendors in all industry tiers. The severity of many of the disclosed and exploited vulnerabilities in 2021, particularly the Log4Shell vulnerabilities and the numerous vulnerabilities associated with Microsoft technologies, should not distract from the number and diversity of affected products throughout 2021. High-risk vulnerabilities and actively exploited vulnerabilities disclosed in 2021 affected products belonging to a more diverse array of parent companies than prior years. Outside of the top 10, which mainly affected Microsoft products, serious actively exploited vulnerabilities were also identified affecting products from Linux, Google, Pulse Connect Secure, and Apple, among others. According to data from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Vulnerability Database (NVD), 21,957 vulnerabilities were published to the NVD in 2021. Comparing the increase in new disclosures since 2017, 2021 showed a threefold increase in the margin of difference from 2019 to 2020. The ever-growing number of disclosed vulnerabilities has rendered vulnerability tracking and prioritization efforts increasingly difficult, placing security teams at a disadvantage relative to their attackers. However, of the 16,473 newly disclosed vulnerabilities with a CVE designator of 2021 listed in the NVD database, only 119 (0.7%) of these vulnerabilities are known to have been actively exploited (per the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog). This major discrepancy between overall disclosures and actual exploitation shows how security teams can use Recorded Future's Platform data to quickly identify vulnerabilities with high risk scores and triggered risk rules indicating active exploitation to facilitate patch prioritization and remediation efforts. In the first half of 2021, attackers ignored consumer-grade software in favor of technology normally used by business clients. In our report for the top 10 vulnerabilities of 2020 based on criminal interest, we found that many of the vulnerabilities exploited in the last several years are associated with software used by the average IT consumer, such as CVE-2017-11882 in Microsoft Office. However, throughout the first half of 2021, the main trend in exploitation was that of either business- or enterprise-class technology, such as Microsoft Exchange and VMware vCenter. Enterprise-grade, high-value software was increasingly targeted by threat actors, introducing the threat of exponentially higher costs associated with cyberattacks. Likewise, many of these major vulnerabilities centered on a relatively new but rapidly expanding field: cloud-based technologies. In the second half of 2021, the increase in vulnerabilities affecting enterprise-class products appeared to subside as several high-profile vulnerabilities targeting consumer-grade technology were disclosed. These included the Apple iOS vulnerability CVE-2021-30860. Citizen Lab researchers linked CVE-2021-30860 to the ForcedEntry exploit used to deliver the Pegasus spyware developed by Israel-based cybersecurity company NSO Group to the iPhones of activists in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. In December 2021, Reuters disclosed that CVE-2021-30860 was also exploited in attacks against 9 employees of the US State Department. Late in 2021, Log4Shell shook the security landscape for individual consumers and major enterprises, affecting a huge range of systems. Log4Shell underscores the most alarming trends in the 2021 vulnerability landscape: the ever-shrinking window for remediation between initial vulnerability disclosures and attacker exploitation and ongoing zero-day vulnerability exploitation by both cybercriminals and nation-state threat actors."
