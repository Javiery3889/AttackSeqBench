        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report indicates that since 2005, Chinese cyber activities, likely reconnaissance missions, have targeted U.S. military systems to identify vulnerabilities or implant trapdoors or viruses. These activities align with an old Chinese stratagem of winning before battle, suggesting pre-battle reconnaissance to spot weaknesses. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is believed to have an advantage in the event of a conflict with America due to these efforts. The PLA's computer network operations, including reconnaissance, are part of their peacetime strategic activities, potentially placing Trojan horses or other devices in U.S. and partner systems to disable or destroy them in case of war.",

The PLA recognizes U.S. reliance on computer systems as a vulnerability ripe for exploitation. Chinese military thought has evolved to believe that only countries that establish information superiority and control ahead of time will win conflicts, necessitating reconnaissance and intelligence gathering before the first battle. The PLA has openly discussed the need for offensive operations, including the use of hackers to obtain military information from computer networks. The PLA has established offensive and defensive computer confrontation forces trained in virus invasions and network penetration. The PLA's focus on offensive operations is not limited to wartime but extends to peacetime conditions as well, with the intent to gain the initiative by obtaining information superiority or preventing cyber strikes."
