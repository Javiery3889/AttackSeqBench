        "Defense Evasion": "Damballa's research into a newer sample of Destover malware led to the discovery of two utilities, setMFT and afset, which are designed to evade detection and facilitate lateral movement through a network. The setMFT utility is used for timestomping, allowing malicious files to blend in with legitimate files by copying timestamp settings. It requires the presence of the 'usbdrv3.sys' file, a renamed Eldos RawDisk driver, to gain direct disk access. The afset utility also performs timestomping and can clean Windows logs based on criteria, change PE build time and checksum, and uses the same RawDisk driver. Both utilities are used interactively and are part of an attacker's arsenal to remain undetected.",

        "Others": "The article from Damballa's Day Before Zero Blog, dated November 18, 2015, discusses the discovery of a new toolset linked to the Destover malware, which was used in the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014 and shares similarities with the Shamoon malware from the Saudi Aramco attack in 2012. The Destover trojan is a wiper that deletes files, causing damage for ideological and political reasons, not financial gain. The article details the tools setMFT and afset, which help attackers evade detection and broaden the attack surface. These tools have limited distribution, which could allow them to go undetected by standard antivirus software. The article concludes that attackers behind significant breaches are organized, patient, and use such toolsets to remain under the radar, often exfiltrating large amounts of data over extended periods. The attack modus operandi includes steps like reconnaissance, breach, foothold, lateral movement, exfiltration, and deleting tracks, with afset and setMFT playing crucial roles in these steps. The article also provides MD5 and SHA256 hashes for both tools and a YARA rule to detect the Destover trojan and associated tools by license key, authored by Willis McDonald and Loucif Kharouni from Damballa Inc."
