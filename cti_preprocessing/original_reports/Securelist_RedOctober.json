The attackers used spear phishing with documents containing exploits for known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2010-3333, and CVE-2012-0158 to gain initial access. The earliest attacks with the MS Excel exploit occurred in 2010 and 2011, while the MS Word exploits were used in the summer of 2012. The spear phishing documents were customized for the victims, with the executable replaced by the attackers' own code.",

The malware targets not only workstations but also mobile devices and network equipment. The attackers have used at least three different exploits for previously known vulnerabilities and have a high degree of interaction with the victims' networks. Kaspersky Lab has identified several hundred infections worldwide, with the majority in Eastern Europe, North America, and Western European countries. The campaign has infected hundreds of victims in eight main categories, including government, diplomatic, research institutions, and military. The attackers' malware modules have been created by Russian-speaking operatives and have not been used in any other operations. Kaspersky Lab, in collaboration with international organizations, is continuing its investigation and providing resources for remediation and mitigation."
