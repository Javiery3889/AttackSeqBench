The attackers utilized spear phishing emails with OLE2 format attachments that contained no active content but had links to PHP scripts on third-party web resources. When opened in Microsoft Word, the application sent a GET request to one of the links, thereby informing the attackers about the software installed on the victim's computer, including the Microsoft Office version.",

However, in the attack, the link was in Unicode, causing Word to ignore it but still follow a URL attached to a form within the document. This URL was the actual link that Word followed when the document was opened, leading to the attackers' server. The report also notes that this feature is present in Microsoft Office for iOS and Android but not in LibreOffice or OpenOffice. Kaspersky Lab's security products can detect the use of this technique and find links embedded in documents using the same method."
