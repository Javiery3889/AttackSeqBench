The DLL then attempts to download a file from a specified URL, which, if valid, is injected into a running explorer.exe process using the CreateRemoteThread API.",

The threat actor behind DELoader, using the alias 'Aleksandr Sirofimov' and the email sir777alex@outlook.com, has been linked to past malicious domain registrations and is associated with a history of bank information theft campaigns targeting German-speaking and Australian users. The malware C&C domain resdomactivationa.asia and other related domains have been used in these campaigns. The DELoader malware has been active since at least February 2016, with a possible connection to the Zeus banking Trojan and Android Marcher variants. An IP address from Kiev, Ukraine, was identified in the C&C logs, suggesting a potential location for the threat actor's testing of the DELoader malware."
