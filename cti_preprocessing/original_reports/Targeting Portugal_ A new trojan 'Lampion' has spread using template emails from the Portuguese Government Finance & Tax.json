The emails, which discuss issues related to a debt from 2018, contain links that download a zip file named 'FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.zip' from an online server. This file, once extracted, reveals three files, one of which is a VBScript file acting as a dropper and downloader for the Lampion trojan.",

This file, once executed, downloads two additional files: 'P-19-2.dll' and '0.zip'. The 'P-19-2.dll' file is executed at system startup and invokes the second file, '0.zip', which contains a DLL with additional code for the trojan's operation.",

Despite these efforts, malicious endpoints were still active at the time of the report's writing."
