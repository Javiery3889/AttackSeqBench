Evil Eye was also suspected of targeting iOS devices with an exploit chain using an open source framework called IRONSQUIRREL. The exploits targeted Apple iOS operating systems leveraging a vulnerability in WebKit, affecting iOS versions 12.3, 12.3.1, and 12.3.2. The exploit chain led to the installation of a new version of the implant, referred to as INSOMNIA, on iOS devices. The attacks involved six exploit websites, five instances of the malware implant, three different C2 IP and port pair combinations, and two unique C2 IP addresses.",
