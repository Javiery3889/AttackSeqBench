Attacks are beginning to target connected home networks, focusing on older, more vulnerable devices such as home routers and entertainment systems. Smart devices, including AI-based virtual assistants, are being compromised to yield valuable information for social engineering-based attacks.

AI and ML systems are being used to build and deploy playbooks that document malicious attack behaviors and cyber-criminal organizations in detail, using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK. These playbooks enable AI systems to detect attack patterns and interrupt attacks by anticipating and shutting down the next step in an attack sequence. Ransomware continues to evolve, with cyber criminals now posting encrypted data on public servers and threatening to release sensitive information if ransom demands are ignored. Swarm intelligence is being used by cyber criminals to quickly overwhelm network defenses and extract critical data. The development of swarm intelligence has powerful implications for adversaries if organizations do not update their security strategies. Quantum computing poses a forward-looking threat, with the potential to undermine the effectiveness of data encryption and cryptographic keys and algorithms. Organizations need to shift to quantum-resistant computing algorithms and adopt a quantum-resistant algorithm several years before quantum computers become generally available."
