        "Execution": "On March 27, 2020, Denis Legezo from Kaspersky reported on a malicious campaign named WildPressure, which distributes a C++ Trojan called Milum. The Trojan, originally named Milum46_Win32.exe, is compiled as a standalone PE file and contains zlib compression functions for C2 communication. It uses base64-encoded JSON data for configuration, which includes C2 URLs, timeouts, and RC4 keys. The Trojan transmits compressed JSON data in HTTP POST requests, encrypted with RC4. Persistence is achieved through HKCU autorun system registry keys Run and RunOnce. The malware was first observed targeting organizations in the Middle East, particularly those related to the industrial sector, with no infections registered before May 31, 2019. The compilation timestamps for the samples are consistent, dated March 2019. The campaign infrastructure utilized rented OVH and Netzbetrieb VPS and a domain registered with Domains by Proxy. Kaspersky products detect this malware as Backdoor.Win32.Agent.",

The Trojan's configuration data contains various parameters, including client IDs and encryption keys, which are unique to each target and facilitate communication with the C2 servers.",

        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The WildPressure campaign, attributed to the Milum Trojan, targets industrial-related entities in the Middle East. The campaign does not show code similarities with known campaigns, and the attacks are considered targeted. The malware version, indicated as 1.0.1, suggests an early stage of development. The RC4 encryption algorithm is used with different 64-byte keys for different victims. The malware exports zlib compression functions, which are unnecessary for a standalone application, indicating potential plans for non-C++ versions. The campaign operators use target IDs found in the samples, such as HatLandM30 and HatLandid3. The Trojan can execute commands, handle files, and gather system information. The C2 domain sinkholing revealed active infections primarily from the Middle East. The attackers' identity remains unknown, with no strong code- or victim-based similarities to any known actor. The spreading mechanism of Milum is not yet known, and the campaign's targeting may be limited by visibility. The malware could potentially be reused in other operations. Indicators of compromise include specific file MD5 hashes and URLs associated with the campaign."
