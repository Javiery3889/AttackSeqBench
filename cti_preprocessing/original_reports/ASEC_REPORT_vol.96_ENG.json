The attacks were related to previous attacks since early 2015, using similar malware and methods, suggesting a continuation of efforts against South Korean government agencies and major diplomatic organizations. The malware used in Operation Red Salt can be classified into three categories: downloader, dropper, and stealer. The downloader, first appearing in September 2015, downloads files from an FTP server. The dropper, also first discovered in September 2015, generates a stealer for stealing user information. The stealer, with a file size of 120 KB, collects and stores user key inputs, screen captures, and system information. ASEC's V3 solutions detect the malware under various aliases, and the report provides Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) including file names and hash codes. Additionally, ASEC analyzed the distribution of Clop ransomware via the Ammyy hacking tool, which uses social engineering to distribute ransomware via email. The ransomware installs a malicious backdoor with a short cycle period, and ASEC found and analyzed SDB-based malware created during the installation and uninstallation of Ammyy. The SDB-based malware uses a Windows mechanism for backward compatibility to execute malicious code when certain functions are called. The malware patches the 'services.exe' process memory with shellcode, making 'services.exe' an agent for the backdoor's malicious behavior after a system reboot. ASEC developed a diagnostics process to detect malicious SDB files and prevent infection before an SDB file operates. The V3 product aliases related to the Ammyy hack tool and the malicious SDB files are provided for detection and prevention."
