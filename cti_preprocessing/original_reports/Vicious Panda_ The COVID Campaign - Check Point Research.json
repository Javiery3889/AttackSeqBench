The documents, weaponized with RoyalRoad tool version 7.x, were sent under the guise of information related to COVID-19, originating from the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Upon opening, the RTF files exploit the Equation Editor vulnerabilities, leading to the dropping of 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder, establishing persistence and requiring a relaunch of Word for full execution.",
        "Execution": "The 'intel.wll' file, once executed, downloads and decrypts the next stage of the infection chain from the server at 95.179.242[.]6. This stage is a DLL file acting as the main loader for the malware framework, which communicates with another C&C server at 95.179.242[.]27 to receive additional functionality. The threat actor's C&C server operates within a limited daily window, complicating the analysis of the advanced parts of the infection chain. The final stage involves downloading and decrypting a RAT module, also a DLL, which is loaded into memory. This modular architecture suggests the possibility of additional modules beyond the observed payload.",

The infrastructure used includes Vultr servers and GoDaddy-registered domains. The malware's full intention remains unclear, but it is part of a long-running operation leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic to lure victims.
