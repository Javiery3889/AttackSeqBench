The attackers, identified as the Elderwood Group with ties to the People's Liberation Army, targeted Google and over 34 other organizations worldwide. The attack originated from China and aimed to access and potentially modify source code repositories at high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies.",

It also led to Google reviewing its business operations in China and considering operating an uncensored search engine within the country or potentially leaving China altogether.",
        "Others": "The attack was named 'Operation Aurora' by Dmitri Alperovitch of McAfee, who discovered that 'Aurora' was part of the file path on the attacker's machine. The Elderwood Group, also known as the 'Beijing Group' by Dell Secureworks, specialized in attacking second-tier defense industry suppliers to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. The attack procedure involved infecting legitimate websites with malware, which then downloaded to computers that accessed the site, allowing the attackers to infiltrate the network connected to the infected computer."
