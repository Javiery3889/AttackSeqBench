        "Others": "Novetta, an advanced analytics company, has observed the Lazarus Group's malware during Operation Blockbuster. The report details technical findings of various tools used by the group, which are not inherently malicious but serve specific purposes in their operations. These tools include keyloggers, proxies, network testers, domain redirectors, firewall disablers, and antivirus suite killers. The Lazarus Group employs these tools to lay the groundwork for further malicious activities, such as targeting antivirus capabilities and disabling firewalls, which are fundamental defensive measures. The tools showcase the group's creative solutions, making it difficult to identify malicious activity on compromised networks immediately. For more information on Novetta's solutions for advanced analytics challenges, contact their headquarters in McLean, Virginia."
