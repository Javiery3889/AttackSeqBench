        "Reconnaissance": "None",

        "Initial Access": "The CTI report by Symantec Security Response identifies Regin as a sophisticated multi-staged modular threat, with the initial stage (Stage 1) involving the installation and configuration of the threat's internal services. The report, however, does not provide a specific infection vector, stating that it varies among targets and is unconfirmed at the time of writing. It suggests that targets may be tricked into visiting spoofed versions of well-known websites, and the threat may be installed through a web browser or by exploiting an application. In one instance, Regin was observed originating from Yahoo! Instant Messenger through an unconfirmed exploit.",
        "Execution": "Regin's execution process is detailed through its multi-staged architecture, which includes six stages. Stage 0, the dropper, is responsible for installing Regin onto the target computer. Stage 1 involves loading a kernel driver that executes Stage 2. Stage 2 is another kernel driver that extracts, installs, and runs Stage 3. Stage 3, a kernel mode DLL, provides a framework for higher-level stages and loads Stage 4. Stage 4 consists of a user-mode orchestrator and multiple kernel payload modules, which are stored in encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers. Stage 5 brings into play the main Regin payload functionality, with files injected into services.exe by Stage 4.",
        "Persistence": "The CTI report does not provide explicit details on the persistence mechanisms used by Regin, but the multi-staged architecture and the use of kernel drivers and EVFS containers suggest that Regin is designed to maintain a long-term presence on infected systems.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "Regin employs advanced techniques to conceal itself and its activities on compromised computers. It uses encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas such as the registry, extended attributes, or raw sectors at the end of the disk. The threat's stealth combines many advanced techniques to remain under the radar, making analysis difficult as all components must be available to fully understand it.",
        "Credential Access": "Regin is capable of stealing passwords and monitoring network traffic, which may include credential information. It can also scan for deleted files on an infected computer and retrieve them. Specific modules within Regin are designed to steal passwords, such as those for Windows Explorer credentials and Internet Explorer LegacySettings.",
        "Discovery": "Regin's discovery capabilities include gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, and retrieving them. It can also monitor network traffic to Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers and collect administration traffic for mobile telephony base station controllers.",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "Regin's collection capabilities are extensive, including several remote access Trojan (RAT) features such as capturing screenshots and taking control of the mouse's point-and-click functions. It can also gather computer information, steal passwords, monitor network traffic, and crawl through the file system. Advanced payload modules are designed to sniff low-level network traffic and exfiltrate data through various channels.",
        "Command and Control": "Regin's command-and-control (C&C) operations are extensive and bidirectional, allowing attackers to initiate communications with compromised computers or vice versa. Compromised computers can serve as a proxy for other infections, and C&C can happen in a peer-to-peer fashion. All communications are strongly encrypted and can use transport protocols such as ICMP, UDP, TCP, and HTTP. The C&C operations are undertaken by various modules, including major groups C373h, 19h, 9, as well as Stage 5 payloads, such as C375h and 1Bh.",
        "Exfiltration": "Regin's exfiltration capabilities include encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data under various names for HTTP-based C&C. It can also exfiltrate data through channels like TCP, UDP, ICMP, and HTTP. The threat logs data to the ApplicationLog.dat file, which is encrypted and compressed.",
