        "Initial Access": "The initial access phase is the starting point for all subsequent phases of an attack. It includes the initial contact with the attack target and compromising the so-called 'patient zero.'",
        "Execution": "The execution of malicious code on a local or remote system primarily takes place in the initial access and lateral movement phases. The next phase cannot be reached without execution of code controlled by the attacker. Execution is thus one of the most important prerequisites for the further development of the attack and for spreading across the target network.",
        "Persistence": "Persistence points within the target network ensure ongoing access to the compromised network. The more important the target is to the adversary, the more effort is put into persistence points for long-time access to the network.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "The escalation of privileges is often needed to install malware or persistence points. Increased privileges are sometimes also required to be able to spread to other systems or gain access to the strategic goals (e.g. data).",
        "Defense Evasion": "Bypassing defense and detection mechanisms, e.g. by turning off the firewall at the endpoint or deleting log data, is one of the tactical goals that threat actors use in every other phase of their mission to either conceal their presence or bypass detection mechanisms.",
        "Credential Access": "Valid credentials play a key role for attackers. Firstly, it enables access to systems with legitimate credentials and lateral movement within the target network. Secondly, it grants access to the data that the attackers want. Furthermore, reusing credentials enables attackers to conduct an attack using few resources because no exploits have to be written, acquired or employed in any other way.",
        "Discovery": "Exploration within the target network is required to locate systems, users and data relevant to the mission.",
        "Lateral Movement": "This refers to moving across a network to the relevant data for the mission. This is often accompanied by the execution phase and the installation of further persistence points.",
        "Collection": "The relevant data is collected.",
        "Command and Control": "The command & control channel is the attacker's means of communication to keep the compromised target infrastructure under his control. If the attacker loses this channel, the attack is literally stopped. As such attackers often establish multiple command & control channels to ensure access.",
        "Exfiltration": "This is the final phase required to successfully complete the mission and involves exfiltrating the relevant data.",
