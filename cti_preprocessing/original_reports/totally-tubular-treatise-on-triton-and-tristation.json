        "Others": "On June 7, 2018, Steve Miller and Evan Reese from FireEye's Mandiant discussed the TRITON framework, a malware designed to target the Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers using the TriStation protocol. The attackers behind TRITON invested significant time in learning about the Triconex SIS controllers and TriStation, a proprietary network communications protocol. The TriStation protocol operates over UDP on port 1502, facilitating communication between engineering workstations and Triconex controllers. FireEye's Advanced Practices Team analyzed TRITON's Python scripts to understand the TriStation protocol, which lacks public documentation. The analysis revealed that the TriStation packet's first offset contains message types, and the packet structure includes various message types and execution command function codes. The TRITON threat actor's knowledge was derived from reverse engineering efforts, but their understanding of the protocol was incomplete, leading to issues when interacting with Triconex controllers in practice. The TRITON code contained annotations, cascading logic, and robust error handling, suggesting a thoughtful development process. The threat actors likely reversed legitimate code from Triconex Corporation binaries to develop TRITON. The blog post emphasizes the importance of visibility into both IT and OT environments for detecting ICS intrusions and suggests that basic security measures are insufficient against persistent threat actors. The authors call for closer collaboration between the Infosec community and ICS vendors to improve monitoring and defense against attacks that move from IT to OT spaces. The blog post concludes with an acknowledgment of the public research on TRITON and TriStation and an invitation for collaboration and feedback."
