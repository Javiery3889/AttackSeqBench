The exploit leverages a previously unknown use-after-free vulnerability, and uses a well-known Flash exploitation technique to achieve arbitrary memory access and bypass Windows' ASLR and DEP protections. The exploit involves preparing the heap with a Flash SWF file, triggering the IE bug via Javascript, and using corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access. Runtime ROP generation is used to search for specific APIs and construct a ROP chain, which is then used to execute shellcode that makes memory executable and clears debug registers, possibly to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation. The shellcode also downloads the next stage of the payload.",

Microsoft has released a security advisory to track this issue. The threat actors are actively using this exploit in an ongoing campaign named 'Operation Clandestine Fox.' The vulnerable versions of IE represent about a quarter of the total browser market. Mitigation measures include using EMET, which may break the exploit, and Enhanced Protected Mode in IE. Additionally, the attack will not work without Adobe Flash, so disabling the Flash plugin within IE will prevent the exploit from functioning. The APT group responsible for this exploit has a history of accessing browser-based 0-day exploits and is proficient at lateral movement without reusing command and control infrastructure. They have used backdoors like Pirpi in the past."
