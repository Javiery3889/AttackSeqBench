The malicious attachments were often Microsoft Word documents with code that exploits vulnerabilities such as CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2012-0158, and CVE-2009-3129. Some samples were simply executable (.EXE) files.",

The FAKEM RAT disguises its network traffic to look like various protocols, including Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger traffic, as well as HTML.

        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The FAKEM RAT infrastructure includes domains such as vcvcvcvc.dyndns.org, zjhao.dtdns.net, avira.suroot.com, *.googmail.com, and freeavg.sytes.net. These domains are used as command-and-control servers for the malware. The research paper by Trend Micro Incorporated highlights the importance of understanding the attack tools, techniques, and infrastructure of adversaries to develop defensive strategies."
