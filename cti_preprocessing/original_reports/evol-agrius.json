The group attempted to exploit FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 against Israeli targets and also tried various 1-day vulnerabilities and SQL injection. Successful exploitation led to the uploading of webshells for lateral movement using RDP.",

This backdoor was registered as a service for persistence and could execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on commands from C2 servers.",

Initially, 'Apostle' was a wiper that failed to execute properly due to a logic flaw but was later turned into functioning ransomware.
