        "Impact": "Foreign intelligence entities (FIEs) are targeting the US space industry, which could harm US commercial firms and broader national and economic security. Tactics include cyberattacks, strategic investments, targeting key supply chain nodes, and other methods to access US space-related innovation and assets. These actions can lead to the siphoning of intellectual property, leapfrogging innovation, using unfair business practices, proliferating counterfeit products, collecting sensitive data, disrupting satellite communications, and degrading the US's ability to provide critical services.",
        "Others": "Indicators of FIE targeting include high cyberactivity from unknown parties, requests to visit company facilities by unknown or foreign entities, probing questions about sensitive information, elicitation at conferences or online forums, unsolicited joint venture offers, recruitment attempts of technical experts, and obscured acquisition efforts by foreign companies. Mitigation strategies involve developing an anomaly log, establishing an insider threat program, fostering a security posture, identifying key competitive assets, conducting due diligence on suppliers and investors, incorporating security requirements into contracts, understanding host country laws, and building resilience against FIE targeting."
