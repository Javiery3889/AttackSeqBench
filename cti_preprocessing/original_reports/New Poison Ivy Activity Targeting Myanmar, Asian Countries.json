A new variant, SPIVY, uses DLL sideloading and operates differently from a variant active for at least the past 12 months. The PIVY variant drops a decoy document, a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll, and the PIVY shellcode file as Active.dat in a directory named ActiveUpdate_[0-9]{3}. It copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe, executes the new file with the path to the DLL, and installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.",

The targeting of post-election Myanmar appears to be following the same style as what was mentioned in the \"Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger\" paper by ASERT. A possible connection exists given that the C2 for these samples resolved to an IP contained within 103.240.203.0/22, as did a 9002 RAT sample in the Seven Pointed Dagger exploitation campaign. A \"LURK0\" Gh0strat and another PIVY domain were also observed to have resolved to IPs contained within this range, making this subnet more suspicious from a targeted attack perspective."
