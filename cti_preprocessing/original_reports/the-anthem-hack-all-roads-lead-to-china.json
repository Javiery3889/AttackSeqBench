The attackers used malware, including a variant of the Derusbi APT malware family and the Sakula backdoor, which were signed with a valid digital signature from the Korean company DTOPTOOLZ Co. The malicious infrastructure used in the attack impersonated legitimate Wellpoint IT infrastructure with domains such as we11point[.]com. The report also mentions a possible link to another healthcare provider, Premera Blue Cross, with similar tactics observed. The ThreatConnect Research Team shared their findings with the ThreatConnect Medical and Health Community and the broader user base to aid in defense against such threats. The report further discusses the involvement of Southeast University and Beijing Topsec in state-sponsored cyber activities, with Professor Song Yubo being a person of interest. The report concludes with a call for a cooperative defense mindset and proactive network defense strategies."
