The exploit was delivered through a waterhole-style injection on a Korean-language news portal, where a malicious JavaScript code was inserted into the main page to redirect victims to the exploit landing page. The attack, named Operation WizardOpium, involved a script that checked the victim's system for compatibility, specifically targeting 64-bit Windows systems and Chrome versions 65 or newer.",
        "Execution": "The exploit, CVE-2019-13720, used in Operation WizardOpium, involved a race condition bug between two threads in Google Chrome, leading to a Use-After-Free (UaF) condition that could result in code execution. The attackers attempted to trigger UaF to perform an information leak and create a deterministic heap layout, utilizing heap spraying techniques to reuse a freed pointer. This allowed the attackers to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive, craft a special object, and execute embedded shellcode payload.",

Additionally, the report provides MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the files involved in the attack, as well as the domain names used by the attackers."
