        "Reconnaissance": "The Lazarus group conducted reconnaissance by using spear-phishing emails embellished with personal information gathered from publicly available sources. The emails targeted various departments within the defense industry, claiming to have urgent updates on COVID-19. The attackers registered email accounts that resembled the medical center's real email addresses and included the actual personal data of the deputy head doctor in the signature. The phishing emails contained a malicious Word document designed to download and execute additional malware.",
        "Resource Development": "None",
        "Initial Access": "The initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents. The documents, which were unrelated to COVID-19, contained macros that, when enabled, would download and execute additional malware. The attackers sent follow-up emails instructing recipients on how to enable macros. The infection was successful when an employee opened one of the attachments, allowing the attackers to gain remote control of the infected system.",
        "Execution": "The malware, known as ThreatNeedle, was executed in a multistage deployment procedure. It began with a spear-phishing document that loaded the next stage as a backdoor running in-memory. The ThreatNeedle backdoor was used for initial reconnaissance and to deploy additional malware for lateral movement.",
        "Persistence": "The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware was responsible for implanting the next stage loader-type malware and registering it for auto-execution to achieve persistence. The loader-type malware existed in several variations and served the primary purpose of loading the final stage of the ThreatNeedle malware in-memory.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Lazarus group utilized various techniques to evade detection, including deleting log files from the router and using a custom web shell script. They also employed masquerading techniques, such as renaming system utilities and modifying registry keys to hide their activities.",
        "Credential Access": "The group executed a credential harvesting tool named Responder from one of the victim machines to acquire login credentials, which were then used for lateral movement.",
        "Discovery": "The group conducted discovery activities such as network share, process, system network configuration, system owner/user, system network connections, system information, file and directory, and system service discovery.",
        "Lateral Movement": "Lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts. The attackers also compromised a router virtual machine to overcome network segmentation and access the restricted network segment.",
        "Collection": "The group archived collected data using utilities to prepare for exfiltration.",
        "Command and Control": "The command-and-control infrastructure involved multiple servers for various stages, with the attackers configuring the Apache web server on a compromised router to use it as a proxy server between the organization's corporate and restricted segments.",
        "Exfiltration": "Data exfiltration was performed using a custom tunneling tool with a custom encryption routine to create a covert channel. The group also used a Trojanized VNC Uploader to upload data to the C2 server via HTTP POST requests.",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The Lazarus group's campaign against the defense industry was attributed to their use of the ThreatNeedle malware cluster, which is an advanced version of Manuscrypt (a.k.a. NukeSped). The group demonstrated its ability to circumvent security measures such as network segmentation. Connections were found between this campaign and other Lazarus group campaigns, including DeathNote, Operation AppleJeus, and Bookcode."
