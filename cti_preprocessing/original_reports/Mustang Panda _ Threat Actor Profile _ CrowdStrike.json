        "Initial Access": "In April 2017, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence observed MUSTANG PANDA, a threat actor with a Chinese nexus, targeting a U.S.-based think tank. The initial access was achieved through a weaponized link to a Google Drive folder, which was obfuscated using the goo.gl link shortening service. The link retrieved a zip file containing a .lnk file disguised as a .pdf file using the double extension trick. The .lnk file redirected the user to a Windows Scripting Component (.wsc) file hosted on an adversary-controlled microblogging page.",
        "Execution": "The execution phase involved the .lnk file using an embedded VBScript component to retrieve a decoy PDF file and a PowerShell script from the adversary-controlled web page. The PowerShell script was then used to create a Cobalt Strike stager payload and retrieve an XOR-encoded Cobalt Strike beacon payload from an adversary-controlled domain.",
        "Persistence": "None",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "MUSTANG PANDA utilized a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of legitimate tools to evade defenses and gain access to targeted systems. They also reused previously-observed legitimate domains to host files, which is indicative of their defense evasion tactics.",

        "Discovery": "None",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",

        "Command and Control": "The Cobalt Strike Beacon implant communicated with the command-and-control (C2) IP address, which was used to remotely control the implant.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "MUSTANG PANDA, a China-based threat actor profiled by CrowdStrike, has demonstrated the ability to rapidly assimilate new tools and tactics into its operations. This includes the use of exploit code for CVE-2017-0199 within days of its public disclosure. The threat actor primarily targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with a specific focus on gathering intelligence on Mongolia. They have been known to use shared malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX in their campaigns. There are no known community or industry names associated with this actor. Other known China-based adversaries include Anchor Panda, Deep Panda, Goblin Panda, and Samurai Panda."
