This exploit was part of the Hacking Team data leak and allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely. The Sednit group's attack begins with a spear-phishing email containing a URL that mimics a legitimate domain, such as \"osce-press.org\". Upon visiting the URL, the victim's browser is directed to a landing page that collects detailed information about the computer. If the system meets the criteria set by the Sednit operators, the Flash exploit named \"flash_video_x86.swf\" is delivered. The exploit's decompiled code closely resembles the Hacking Team's version, with the main difference being the way the shellcode is received.",

Once the privilege escalation exploit is effective, the malware establishes persistence on the machine through a scheduled task that runs with the highest privileges.",
