Terracotta is marketed in China under several brand names, offering anonymous traversal of government internet censorship. It acquires nodes and bandwidth through malicious methods, providing cost savings for operators. Terracotta VPN is used by suspected nation-state sponsored campaigns targeting Western governments and commercial entities, making detection by IP address indicators difficult due to the continuous addition of new nodes hosted in legitimate organizations. The report exposes a PRC-based VPN operation that enlists vulnerable servers worldwide, marking the first exposure of such a network used by APT actors for anonymization and obfuscation."
