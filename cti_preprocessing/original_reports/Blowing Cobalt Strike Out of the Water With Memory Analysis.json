        "Defense Evasion": "The CTI report from Unit 42 researchers discusses the evasion tactics used by Cobalt Strike malware, which operates mainly in memory, making detection challenging. Cobalt Strike is known for its evasion techniques, such as using memory allocation methods like HeapAlloc, MapViewOfFile, and VirtualAlloc, and for attempting to free memory associated with the reflective DLL package. It can override the MZ header of its reflective DLL, obfuscate the import table, and use function pointer hints to bootstrap the agent without walking the kernel32 Export Address Table (EAT). Additionally, it can stomp MZ, PE, and e_lfanew values after loading the payload and use or avoid read, write, or execute (RWX) permissions for the Beacon DLL in memory.",

Cobalt Strike, a red team adversary simulation framework, is often abused by threat actors for malicious purposes, including the SolarWinds incident in 2020. The report details three Cobalt Strike loaders: KoboldLoader, MagnetLoader, and LithiumLoader, which were detected by a new hypervisor-based sandbox designed to analyze artifacts in memory. The report also discusses the importance of analyzing memory during execution to detect function pointers, decoded stages of the loader, and other artifacts. The researchers emphasize that combining execution logs and memory analysis data creates a more effective detection strategy. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for the discussed loaders and their configurations are provided in the report's appendix."
