The spambots involved in spreading Dridex have included Necurs, Cutwail, and Andromeda at different times.",

The loader employs the OutputDebugStringW function as an anti-debug technique, producing numerous debug messages to complicate analysis.

It also details the infection chain, targets, lures, and initial detection rate of Dridex delivery files. Additionally, the report includes information on the network activity of Dridex, the use of IP addresses to map the malware's network, and the detection of Dridex spikes, indicating successful interception of the malware at early stages. The report concludes with a list of indicators linked to Dridex, such as domains, IP addresses, URLs, and hashes of malicious documents and malware samples."
