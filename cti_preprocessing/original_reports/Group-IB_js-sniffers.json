The report reveals that the total number of JS-sniffer families has reached 38, with 15 described in the report. It also discusses the methods of infection, including exploiting CMS vulnerabilities, hacking administrative panels, and attacking third-party services. The report highlights the scale of infections, with at least 2,440 online stores affected and over 1.5 million daily visitors to these sites. Recommendations for affected parties, such as issuer banks, online store administrators, and payment systems, are provided to mitigate the risks associated with JS-sniffers. Detailed descriptions of specific JS-sniffer families, including GMO, TokenLogin, TokenMSN, and ImageID, are included, along with their infrastructure and methods of operation."
