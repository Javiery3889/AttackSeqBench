        "Reconnaissance": "Cisco Talos has observed SideCopy APT's activities targeting government personnel in India, using tactics and themes similar to APT36, which includes using decoys posing as operational documents belonging to the military and think tanks, and honeytrap-based infections. SideCopy campaigns use themes predominantly designed to target military personnel in the Indian subcontinent, with many LNK files and decoy documents posing as internal, operational documents of the Indian Army. They also use honeytraps to lure victims in, displaying explicit photos of women, and clone legitimate websites to serve malicious content. SideCopy has shown a particular interest in Kavach, an MFA app used across India's government, deploying njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' and using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.",
        "Resource Development": "SideCopy APT group mimics the Sidewinder APT's infection chains to deliver their own set of malware. They have used a variety of post-infection plugins specifically for espionage, indicating a focus on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India. SideCopy also uses phishing portals posing as the Government of India's webmail to trick victims into divulging their email credentials.",
        "Initial Access": "SideCopy's infection chains have remained relatively consistent with minor variations, using malicious LNK files as entry points, followed by a convoluted infection chain involving multiple HTAs and loader DLLs to deliver the final payloads. They have also used self-extracting RAR-based dropper executables and MSI-based installers as part of their infection techniques.",
        "Execution": "SideCopy deploys a variety of RATs and plugins post-infection, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers. They have developed multiple new RAT families and plugins currently used in SideCopy infection chains.",
        "Persistence": "SideCopy uses various techniques to maintain persistence on infected systems, including the use of malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers. They also use registry keys for persistence and have been observed using VBScripts to persist MargulasRAT via the registry.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "SideCopy employs tactics to avoid detection, such as using decoy documents and images, and mimicking legitimate processes. They also use cloned websites to serve malicious content and have shown a particular interest in evading detection by targeting Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India.",
        "Credential Access": "SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting access credentials from central Indian government employees. They commonly target Kavach, an MFA app used across India's government, and have deployed njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach.' They also use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.",
        "Discovery": "SideCopy uses themes predominantly designed to target military personnel in the Indian subcontinent, with many LNK files and decoy documents posing as internal, operational documents of the Indian Army. They also use honeytraps to lure victims in, displaying explicit photos of women, and clone legitimate websites to serve malicious content.",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "SideCopy utilizes modular plugins to carry out specific malicious tasks on the infected endpoint, such as file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging. They have developed multiple new RAT families and plugins currently used in SideCopy infection chains.",
        "Command and Control": "SideCopy's delivery infrastructure consists of either setting up fake websites or using compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts to specific victims. The delivery scripts verify that requests to receive artifacts/payloads are from two specific geographies: India and Pakistan. All requests are logged to a log file on the delivery server to keep track of artifacts served to potential victims.",
