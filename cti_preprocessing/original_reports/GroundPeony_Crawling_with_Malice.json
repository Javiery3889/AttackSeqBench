The group's recent campaign involved spear-phishing emails with lure documents and URL obfuscation to download and execute malicious payloads from compromised websites, ultimately establishing communication with a C&C server.",

The side-loaded DLL, \"version.dll\", functioned as a shellcode launcher for \"mic.doc\", which is a shellcode downloader known as micDown.
