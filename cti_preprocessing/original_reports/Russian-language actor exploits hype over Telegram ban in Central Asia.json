        "Initial Access": "In April 2018, a new Octopus sample was discovered, masquerading as communication software for a Kazakh opposition political group. The malware, named Octopus, was packed in a ZIP file called dvkmailer.zip, with a timestamp indicating it was created between February and March 2018. The ZIP file contained a fake Telegram Messenger with a Russian interface, designed to exploit the potential Telegram ban in Kazakhstan. The dropper, which pretends to be legitimate software, was found to use third-party Delphi libraries for JSON-based C2 communications and TurboPower Abbrevia for compression. The malware achieves persistence through the system registry, and the server side utilizes commercial hosting with .php scripts deployed. The distribution method of the malware is unclear, but it likely involves social engineering, as the actor previously used spear phishing.",
        "Execution": "Upon execution, the Octopus launcher checks for the presence of a file named TelegramApi.dll in the same directory. If found, it copies the network module to the startup directory as Java.exe and runs it. The launcher, which is a Delphi Visual Component Library (VCL) program, has only three programmer-defined handlers for controlling elements, with no handler for the 'Send mailing' button, suggesting the malware may be unfinished or created in haste without communication features.",

The actor's malware, Octopus, is related to DustSquad and uses Delphi as the programming language. The report includes technical details of the malware, its infrastructure, and indicators of compromise, including file hashes, domains, IPs, and auxiliary URLs for file upload/download. The report also mentions other threat actors such as IndigoZebra and Sofacy (with Zebrocy malware) targeting the region. The interest in Central Asia by threat actors is noted to be high, with DustSquad being a relatively new local player."
