        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report describes a campaign by a threat actor named Packrat, which has systematically targeted high-profile political figures, journalists, and others in several Latin American countries, including Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil. Packrat has been active since at least 2008, using malware and phishing to gather information. They have also created fake opposition groups and news organizations to distribute malware and conduct phishing attacks. The report does not conclusively attribute Packrat to a particular sponsor but assesses that state sponsorship is likely given the nature of the targets and the persistence of the campaign.",
        "Resource Development": "Packrat has maintained a persistent campaign over seven years, suggesting they have the resources to support their operations. The campaign's infrastructure includes 12 different malware command and control domains and over 30 samples of malware. Packrat's activities also involve creating and maintaining fake online organizations in Venezuela and Ecuador, which indicates a systematic approach to resource development for their operations.",
        "Initial Access": "Packrat has targeted individuals with malware and phishing attacks, often using fake organizations during this period. They have also created elaborate fake news organizations without any evidence of malware or phishing activity. The report links attacks in Ecuador in 2015 to a campaign active in Argentina in 2014, targeting individuals such as Alberto Nisman and Jorge Lanata. The attackers have used phishing domains with Ecuadorian and Venezuelan targeting that became active during this period.",
        "Execution": "Packrat has used various types of malware, primarily Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RATs such as Cybergate, Xtreme, AlienSpy, and Adzok. These malware families are known to researchers, and Packrat typically obfuscates their malware using a range of tools, including an unknown VB6 crypter, AutoIt3Wrapper, UPX, PECompact, PEtite, and Allatori Obfuscator. This layer of obfuscation means that Packrat's attacks frequently escaped detection by antivirus when the attacks were deployed.",
        "Persistence": "Packrat's use of malware suggests efforts to maintain persistence within compromised networks. The malware employed by Packrat, such as CyberGate and Xtreme RAT, includes features for persistence and monitoring, ensuring continued access to systems.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "Packrat's use of obfuscation techniques and runtime packers indicates a focus on defense evasion. By wrapping their RATs in AutoIt3Wrapper and employing various obfuscators, they have managed to evade antivirus detection and maintain their operations over an extended period.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "None",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "None",
        "Command and Control": "Packrat's command and control infrastructure has been detailed, with domains such as deyrep24.ddns.net and daynews.sytes.net being used to communicate with malware on targeted systems. The infrastructure has been hosted with various providers around Latin America and has also included servers in Europe and the US.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The report discusses the challenge of attributing the Packrat campaign to a specific actor. While state sponsorship is considered likely due to the nature of the targets and the campaign's persistence, the report acknowledges that Packrat's lack of technical sophistication, such as the absence of exploits and reliance on COTS malware, does not conclusively point to a state actor. The report presents scenarios for both state sponsorship and non-state actors but ultimately does not provide sufficient data for conclusive attribution."
