        "Initial Access": "\nThroughout the last decade, ModifiedElephant operators sought to infect their targets via spearphishing emails with malicious file attachments, with their techniques evolving over time. Their primary delivery mechanism is malicious Microsoft Office document files weaponized to deliver the malware of choice at the time. The specific payloads changed over the years and across different targets. However, some notable trends remain.\n\n- In mid-2013, the actor used phishing emails containing executable file attachments with fake double extensions (filename.pdf.exe).\n- After 2015, the actor moved on to less obvious files containing publicly available exploits, such as .doc, .pps, .docx, .rar, and password protected .rar files. These attempts involved legitimate lure documents in .pdf, .docx, and .mht formats to captivate the target's attention while also executing malware.\n- In 2019 phishing campaigns, ModifiedElephant operators also took the approach of providing links to files hosted externally for manual download and execution by the target.\n- As first publicly noted by Amnesty in reference to a subset of this activity, the attacker also made use of large .rar archives (up to 300MB), potentially in an attempt to bypass detection.\n\nObserved lure documents repeatedly made use of CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-1761, CVE-2013-3906, CVE-2015-1641 exploits to drop and execute their malware of choice. The spearphishing emails and lure attachments are titled and generally themed around topics relevant to the target, such as activism news and groups, global and local events on climate change, politics, and public service. A public deconstruction of two separate 2014 phishing emails was shared by Arsenal Consulting in early 2021.",

The group uses commercially available remote access trojans (RATs) and may have ties to the commercial surveillance industry. Notable malware families deployed by ModifiedElephant include NetWire and DarkComet RATs. The group also used keyloggers and an Android trojan to extend their surveillance capabilities.\n\nThe group's activities have potential overlaps with other threat actors, including SideWinder, which targets similar individuals. ModifiedElephant's operations align with Indian state interests, and there is a correlation between their attacks and the arrests of individuals in politically-charged cases. The group's tactics have evolved over time, with a clear trend in rotating infrastructure and adapting their spearphishing techniques.\n\nThe report includes a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) consisting of various malware samples and domain names associated with ModifiedElephant's activities."
