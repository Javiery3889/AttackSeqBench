These C2 servers, such as the legitimate Korean laundry service website whitepia[.]co.kr, were used to host the Datper C2, which did not employ SSL encryption or certificates. The C2 server, which resolved to the IP 111[.]92[.]189[.]19, was used to execute shell commands on victim machines and obtain hostnames and drive information. Talos identified overlaps in C2 domains and infrastructure patterns, suggesting links between the malware families. For instance, both Datper and xxmm backdoor used the same Japanese website amamihanahana[.]com in their C2 infrastructure. Additionally, a legitimate website that resolved to the IP 211[.]13[.]196[.]164 was used as a C2 server by both Datper and Emdivi malware families, indicating potential resource sharing. Talos' passive DNS lookup data further supports the use of shared infrastructure by these malware families.",
