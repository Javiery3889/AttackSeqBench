Notably, APT5, active since at least 2007, targeted telecommunications and technology companies, stealing sensitive communications.

APT groups also focus on stealing intellectual property from leading companies in energy, telecommunications, high-tech, finance, and transportation sectors. The report details malware families such as Lecna, Mirage, CannonFodder, and Leouncia, and notes that targeted malware detections were most frequent in government and telecommunications sites. Non-targeted threats like Zeus and Sality were also prevalent. The report emphasizes the dual threat to the financial sector from cybercriminals and advanced threat actors seeking sensitive financial information. FireEye's products helped detect malware across the region, with a higher detection rate in the Asia-Pacific than the global average."
