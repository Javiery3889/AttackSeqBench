In the case of Wannacry,Google's Neel Mehta was able to identify a code fragment which becamethe most important clue in the story, and was later con\frmed by furtherevidence, showing Wannacry as a pet project of the Lazarus group.\n\nTo date, nobody has been able to \nd any signi\fcant code sharingbetween ExPetr/Petya and older malware. Given our love for unsolvedmysteries, we jumped right on it.\n\nAnalyzing the SimilaritiesAt the beginning of the ExPetr outbreak, one of our team memberspointed to the fact that the speci\fc list of extensions used by ExPetr isvery similar to the one used by BlackEnergy's KillDisk ransomware from2015 and 2016 (Anton Cherepanov from ESET made the same observationon Twitter).\n\nThe BlackEnergy APT is a sophisticated threat actor that is known to haveused at least one zero day, coupled with destructive tools, and codegeared towards attacking ICS systems. They are widely con\frmed as theentity behind the Ukraine power grid attack from 2015 as well as a chainof other destructive attacks that plagued that country over the past years.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about the BlackEnergy APT, be sureto check our previous blogs on the topic:\n\nBE2 custom plugins, router abuse and target pro\fllesBE2 extraordinary pluginsBlackEnergy APT Attacks in Ukraine employ spearphishing with Worddocuments\n\nGoing back to the hunt for similarities, here's how the targeted extensionslists looks in ExPetr and a version of a wiper used by the BE APT group in2015:\n\nExPetr\n\n3ds, .7z, .accdb, .ai, .asp,.aspx, .avhd, .back, .bak,.c, .cfg, .conf, .cpp, .cs,.ctl, .dbf, .disk, .djvu,.doc, .docx, .dwg, .eml,.fdb, .gz, .h, .hdd, .kdbx,.mail, .mdb, .msg, .nrg,.ora, .ost, .ova, .ovf, .pdf,.php, .pmf, .ppt, .pptx,.pst, .pvi, .py, .pyc, .rar,.rtf, .sln, .sql, .tar, .vbox,.vbs, .vcb, .vdi, .vfd, .vmc,.vmdk, .vmsd, .vmx,.vsdx, .vsv, .work, .xls\n\n2015 BlackEnergy wipersample\n\n.3ds, .7z, .accdb, .accdc, .ai,.asp, .aspx, .avhd, .back,.bak, .bin, .bkf, .cer, .cfg,.conf, .crl, .crt, .csr, .csv,.dat, .db3, .db4, .dbc, .dbf,.dbx, .djvu, .doc, .docx, .dr,.dwg, .dxf, .edb, .eml, .fdb,.gdb, .git, .gz, .hdd, .ib, .ibz,.io, .jar, .jpeg, .jpg, .jrs, .js,.kdbx, .key, .mail, .max,.mdb, .mdbx, .mdf, .mkv,.mlk, .mp3, .msi, .my, .myd,.nsn, .oda, .ost, .ovf, .p7b,.p7c, .p7r, .pd, .pdf, .pem,.pfx, .php, .pio, .piz, .png,.ppt, .pptx, .ps, .ps1, .pst,.pvi, .pvk, .py, .pyc, .rar, .rb,.rtf, .sdb, .sdf, .sh, .sl3, .spc,.sql, .sqlite, .sqlite3, .tar, .ti\nc,.vbk, .vbm, .vbox, .vcb, .vdi,.vfd, .vhd, .vhdx, .vmc,.vmdk, .vmem, .vmfx, .vmsd,.vmx, .vmxf, .vsd, .vsdx, .vsv,.wav, .wdb, .xls, .xlsx, .xvd,.zip\n\nObviously, the lists are similar in composition and formatting, but notidentical. Moreover, older versions of the BE destructive module haveeven longer lists. Here's a snippet of an extensions list from a 2015 BEsample that is even longer:\n\nNevertheless, the lists were similar in the sense of being stored in thesame dot-separated formats. Although this indicated a possible link, wewondered if we could \nd more similarities, especially in the code ofolder variants of BlackEnergy and ExPetr.\n\nWe continued to chase that hunch during the frenetic early analysis phaseand shared this gut feeling of a similarity between ExPetr and BlackEnergywith our friends at Palo Alto Networks. Together, we tried to build a list offeatures that we could use to make a YARA rule to detect both ExPetr andBlackEnergy wipers.\n\nDuring the analysis, we focused on the similar extensions list and the coderesponsible for parsing the \flle system for encryption or wiping. Here's thecode responsible for checking the extensions to target in the currentversion of ExPetr:\n\nThis works by going through the target \flle system in a recursive way, thenchecking if the extension for each \flle is included in the dot-separated list.Unfortunately for our theory, the way this is implemented in olderBlackEnergy variants is quite di\nerent; the code is more generic and thelist of extensions to target is initialized at the beginning, and passed downto the recursive disk listing function.\n\nInstead, we took the results of automated code comparisons and pairedthem down to a signature that perfectly \flt the mould of both in the hopeof unearthing similarities. What we came up with is a combination ofgeneric code and interesting strings that we put together into a cohesiverule to single out both BlackEnergy KillDisk components and ExPetrsamples. The main example of this generic code is the inlined wcscmpfunction merged by the compiler's optimization, meant to check if the\fllename is the current folder, which is named \".\".  Of course, this code ispretty generic and can appear in other programs that recursively list \flles.It's inclusion alongside a similar extension list makes it of particularinterest to us \n\nLooking further, we identi\fed some other candidate strings which,although not unique, when combined together allow us to \flngerprint thebinaries from our case in a more precise way. These include:\n\nexe /r /fComSpecInitiateSystemShutdown\n\nWhen put together with the wcscmp inlined code that checks on the\fllename, we get the following YARA rule:\n\n12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334\n\n rule blackenergy_and_petya_similarities { \n\n strings:     //shutdown.exe /r /f    $bytes00 = { 73 00 68 00 75 00 74 00 64 00 6f 00 77 00 6e 0\n\n   //ComSpec    $bytes01 = { 43 00 6f 00 6d 00 53 00 70 00 65 00 63 00 } \n\n   //InitiateSystemShutdown    $bytes02 = { 49 6e 69 74 69 61 74 65 53 79 73 74 65 6d 53 6\n\n   //68A4430110             push         0100143A4 ;'n   //FF151CD10010             call         GetModuleHand   //3BC7             cmp          eax,edi    //7420             jz          \n\n    $bytes03 = { 68 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 ff 15 ?? ?? ?? ?0 3b c7 74 ?? }\n\n   // \"/c\"    $bytes04 = { 2f 00 63 00 } \n\n         //wcscmp(    $hex_string = { b9 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 8d 44 24 ?c 66 8b 10 66 3b 1     85 d2 74 15 66 8b 50 02 66 3b 51 02 75 0     de 33 c0 eb 05 1b c0 83 d8 ff 85 c0 0f 8     44 24 ?c 66 8b 10 66 3b 11 75 1e 66 85 d     75 0f 83 c0 04 83 c1 04 66 85 d2 75 de 3     0f 84 ?? 0? 00 00 } \n\n condition: \n\n   ((uint16(0) == 0x5A4D)) and (filesize < 5000000) and     (all of them)  } \n\nWhen run on our extensive (read: very big) malware collection, the YARArule above \fres on BlackEnergy and ExPetr samples only. Unsurprisingly,when used alone, each string can generate false positives or catch otherunrelated malware. However, when combined together in this fashion,they become very precise. The technique of grouping generic or popularstrings together into unique combinations is one of the most e\ffective\n\nOf course, this should not be considered a sign of a de\fnitive link, but itdoes point to certain code design similarities between these malwarefamilies.\n\nThis low con\fdence but persistent hunch is what motivates us to askother researchers around the world to join us in investigating thesesimilarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin ofExPetr/Petya. Looking back at other high pro\flle cases, such as theBangladesh Bank Heist or Wannacry, there were few facts linking them tothe Lazarus group. In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, andothers, to link them together with high con\fdence. Further research canbe crucial to connecting the dots, or, disproving these theories.\n\nWe'd like to think of this ongoing research as an opportunity for an openinvitation to the larger security community to help nail down (or disprove)the link between BlackEnergy and ExPetr/Petya. Our colleagues at ESEThave published their own excellent analysis suggesting a possible linkbetween ExPetr/Petya and TeleBots (BlackEnergy).  Be sure to check outtheir analysis. And as mentioned before, a special thanks to our friends atPalo Alto for their contributions on clustering BlackEnergy samples.\n\nHashes\n\nExPetr:\n\n027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745\n\n11b7b8a7965b52ebb213b023b6772dd2c76c66893fc96a18a9a33c8cf125af80\n\n5d2b1abc7c35de73375dd54a4ec5f0b060ca80a1831dac46ad411b4fe4eac4c6\n\nF52869474834be5a6b5df7f8f0c46cbc7e9b22fa5cb30bee0f363ec6eb056b95\n\n368d5c536832b843c6de2513baf7b11bcafea1647c65df7b6f2648840fa50f75\n\nA6a167e214acd34b4084237ba7f6476d2e999849281aa5b1b3f92138c7d91c7a\n\nEdbc90c217eebabb7a9b618163716f430098202e904ddc16ce9db994c6509310\n\nF9f3374d89baf1878854f1700c8d5a2e5cf40de36071d97c6b9\ff6b55d837fca\n\nAPT   BLACKENERGY   DATA ENCRYPTION   PETYA  \n\nWIPER\n\nShare post on:\n\nRelated Posts\n\nBlackOasis APTand newtargetedattacksleveragingzero-dayexploit\n\nIntroducingWhiteBear\n\nThe FestiveComplexitiesof SIGINT-Capable ThreatActors"
