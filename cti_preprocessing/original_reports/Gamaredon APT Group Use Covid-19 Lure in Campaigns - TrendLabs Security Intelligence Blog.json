These emails leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic as a lure, with subjects such as 'Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)' to entice victims to open the attachments. The attack utilized a template injection technique to load a document template from the internet, which contained malicious macro codes.",
        "Execution": "Upon opening the malicious document, the embedded macro code executed a VBScript (VBS) that was obfuscated. The VBS, named 'PlayList.vbs', was dropped into the '%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\MediaPlayer' directory and then executed using 'wscript.exe'.",

However, during the analysis, the C&C server was not accessible, preventing the acquisition of additional payloads.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The Gamaredon APT group has been active since 2013, primarily targeting Ukrainian government institutions. The group's activities were tracked from late 2019 to February 2020, with several reports published. The group's use of COVID-19 as a lure is part of a broader trend of threat actors exploiting the pandemic. The IP addresses used for the attack infrastructure were linked to Russian hosting companies, suggesting the use of rented Virtual Private Servers (VPS) for the attacks. The article recommends vigilance against suspicious emails, careful examination of file extensions, and caution with email attachments, especially those requesting macro activation. Trend Micro provides multiple security solutions to protect against such threats."
