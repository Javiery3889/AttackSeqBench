The authors used VMProtect to make the samples less prone to detection, a technique also common among pre-leak Hacking Team spyware.

The samples were signed with six different certificates issued to Valeriano Bedeschi, Raffaele Carnacina, Megabit, OOO, ADD Audit, Media Lid, and Ziber Ltd. The versioning observed in the analyzed samples continues where Hacking Team left off before the breach, and follows the same patterns. The functionality of the spyware largely overlaps with that in the leaked source code, with no significant updates confirmed. ESET has detected these new Hacking Team spyware samples in fourteen countries."
