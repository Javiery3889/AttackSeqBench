On June 24, the source code of muddyc3 was leaked on another Telegram channel and related auctions were conducted. Security researchers posted malicious samples and decompiled source code with the same version on Github (https://github.com/0xffff0800/muddyc3). The tool's main body is a server-based script web.py, used to process requests from clients and provide responses. It supports delivering the next stage payload such as sct, hta, and powershell, uploading, downloading, information collection, as well as supported modules.",

        "Others": "The analysis of the muddyc3 tool revealed that it was generated by PyInstaller in an x64 environment. Two samples named muddyc3.exe were found, with versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.0. The decompiled files, after removing related libraries, indicated that the versions are only slightly different at the code level. The tool requires specifying a C&C server IP and port, and a proxy IP if needed. It supports four commands: list, show, use, and payload, with the show command lacking related processing logic in the code. The initial script payload code can be embedded in a document as a macro, which, when executed by the target, will access the C2 with the specified path. The URL paths for v1.0.0 and v1.0.1 are somewhat different. The tool does not contain the default Powershell payload code, so it is unclear what will be delivered next. The QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center's RedDrip team will continue monitoring the situation."
