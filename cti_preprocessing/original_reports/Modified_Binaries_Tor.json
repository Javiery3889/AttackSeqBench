        "Others": "After the development and deployment of a new exitmap module, it was discovered that binaries were being altered through a Tor exit node in Russia. The module, named patchingCheck.py, was designed to detect modifications in transit, and it identified an active node that was wrapping original binaries within another binary, thereby evading simple self-checking mechanisms like those used by NSIS. This technique allowed the malware authors to bypass the NSIS error and maintain the original icon by keeping the .rsrc section intact. The node, identified as 8361A794DFA231D863E109FC9EEEF21F4CF09DDDPublished, was found to patch uncompressed PE files and was the only one out of over 1110 exit nodes on the Tor network found engaging in this activity. The Tor Project has been notified of the issue by Leviathan. The article emphasizes the importance of hosting binaries over SSL/TLS and the necessity for users, particularly in countries with internet restrictions and those using Tor, to verify hashes and signatures before executing binaries."
