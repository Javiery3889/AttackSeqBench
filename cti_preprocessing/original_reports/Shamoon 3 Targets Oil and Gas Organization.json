        "Execution": "On December 10, 2018, a new variant of the Disttrack malware, sharing significant code with the Disttrack malware used in the Shamoon 2 attacks, was submitted to VirusTotal. The Disttrack dropper installs a communications and wiper module and attempts to spread to other systems on the network. The dropper has a hardcoded kill time, after which it starts wiping files on the system. It contains three resources: a communications module, a wiper module, and an x64 variant of the dropper. The dropper extracts these modules using an XOR cipher and a specific base64 encoded string as the key.",

It is designed to reach out to hardcoded URLs to communicate with the C2 server, but this module does not contain functional C2 domains. If functional, it would create a URL with a parameter named 'selection' followed by system information and the contents of a specific file. The module can handle two commands from the C2 server: one to read a base64 encoded file and execute it, and another to write a supplied date to a file used by another module responsible for wiping the system.",
