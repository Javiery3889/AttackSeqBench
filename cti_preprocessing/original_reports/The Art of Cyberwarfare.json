According to the report, the attackers targeted Russian federalexecutive authorities.\n\nWhile analyzing the report, Anastasia Tikhonova (Head of APT Research at Group-IB) and Dmitry Kupin (Senior MalwareAnalyst) noticed that they had already come across similar tools in earlier attacks.\n\nChinese APTs are one of the most numerous and aggressive hacker communities. Several dozen groups conduct attacks in countriesall over the world, and Russia is no exception. Hackers mostly target state agencies, industrial facilities, military contractors, andresearch institutes. The main objective is espionage: attackers gain access to confidential data and attempt to hide their presence foras long as possible. There have been cases when attackers successfully persisted in the victim's network for several years.\n\nUnfortunately, the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report did not provide indicators of compromise, so the experts had to rely ondescriptions of the functionality and screenshots of the malicious code. As a result, Group-IB's researchers came up with someinteresting conclusions about which Chinese groups could be behind the attacks against Russian federal executive authorities in2020, what tools they used, and how their malware has evolved since.Key conclusions\n\nThe research describes Webdav-O malware detected in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities in 2020.\n\nGroup-IB experts detected two versions of the Webdav-O Trojan for x86 and x64 systems.\n\nWhen comparing parts of the code, the specialists proved that the Webdav-O x64 Trojan was used in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities. The malware has existed since at least 2018.\n\nGroup-IB specialists established that Webdav-O has a set of commands similar to a popular Trojan called BlueTraveller (aka RemShell), which was developed in China and has been linked to the hackergroup called TaskMasters.\n\n     \n8/8/2021\n\nThe Art of Cyberwarfare\n\nBefore that, Sentinel Labs released a report about malware called Mail-O, which was also identified in attacks against Russian federal executiveauthorities. Mail-O was deemed to be linked to the Chinese hackergroup TA428.\n\nGroup TA428 is known to use a Trojan called Albaniiutas in theirattacks. Group-IB's analysis showed that Albaniiutas is an updatedversion of BlueTraveller.\n\nGroup-IB experts believe that either both Chinese hacker groups(TA428 and TaskMasters) attacked Russian federal executiveauthorities in 2020 or that there is one united Chinese hacker groupmade up of different units.\n\nTA428 is a Chinese state-sponsored hacker group that has beenoperating since 2013. The attackers target a number of governmentagencies in East Asia that control governmental informationtechnology, domestic and foreign policy, and economic development.\n\nTaskMasters (aka BlueTraveller) is a state-sponsored Chinesehacker group that allegedly has been active since at least 2010. Thegroup attacks companies based in several countries, but many of theirtargets are located in Russia and CIS. The hackers target solid industrialand energy enterprises, government agencies, and transport companies.Starting point\n\nAs the experts put it: \"The report dwells on the analysis of aseries of targeted attacks\". Based on this information, weassumed that several hacker groups may be behind the attacks.\n\nThe attackers used malware that interacted with managementserver via the cloud service called Yandex.Disk. The malware wasdubbed Webdav-O.\n\nAttackers also used malicious software that accessed the cloudservice Mail.ru. The malware was dubbed Mail-O.\n\nIn early June 2021, analysts from the American cybersecurity companySentinel Labs released a report about Mail-O. The experts wrote that Mail-O is a version of the relatively well-known malware called SManager, which is used by the Chinese hacker group TA428.\n\n    \n8/8/2021\n\nThe Art of Cyberwarfare\n\nGroup-IB specialists wanted to make sure that Mail-O is loader, while Smanager and Tmanger are Remote Access Trojans (RAT). However, a part of the code overlaps in the exported functions \"Entery\"and \"ServiceMain\" of Mail-O, SManager and Tmanger, which brings us back to TA428. Moreover, hackers from TA428 have already been found to be involved in espionage against Russia, especiallyRussian state facilities.\n\nTo prove the hypothesis that TA428 was behind the attacks against Russian federal executive authorities in 2020, we decided to analyze a sample of Webdav-O. Group-IB Threat Intelligence &Attribution has detected similar malicious behavior before and can now explain why we link it to a specific group. Below we provide an analysis of Webdav-O samples and highlight features that overlapwith the points mentioned in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report.\n\n\u9a91\u9a74\u627e\u9a6c [q\u00ed l\u01d8 zh\u01ceo m\u01ce] \n\nVerbatim translation: Ride a mule while looking for a horse.\n\nDefinition: Use the tools you have while looking for something better.Analysis of Webdav-O sample\n\n1.dll\n\nc9e03855f738e360d24018e2d203142c7ae6c2ec\n\nCompilation timestamp 2018-07-12 03:08:01\n\nFirst Submission\n\n2019-11-07 10:34:11\n\nDll Name\n\ny_dll.dll\n\nExport function\n\nServiceMain\n\nFile \"1.dll\" is an x86 dynamic link library (DLL) that functions as a service in the system. \n\nThe analyzed file provides remote access to the command line shell (cmd.exe) and executes various commands originating from C2 on the compromised host.\n\nThe legitimate cloud service called Yandex.Disk (webdav.yandex.ru:443) is used as network infrastructure, namely C&C. Network interaction with the cloud is implemented via the Webdav protocol. Theauthentication method is Basic.\n\nThe strings and configuration data are encrypted with the RC4 algorithm using the following key: { 8A 4F 01 47 34 C9 75 F8 2B C8 C1 E9 D2 F3 A5 8B }. The key size is 16 bytes.

In case of success, the system checks for batch files in the \"/test\" directory of \"Yandex.Disk\"(PROFIND).\n\n \n8/8/2021\n\nThe Art of Cyberwarfare\n\nA command file is defined for downloading from the Yandex.Disk cloud (GET).

After downloading the command file, it is deleted from Yandex.Disk (DELETE).\n\nThe file \"/test2.txt\" is uploaded to Yandex.Disk (PUT). The file \"/test2.txt\" contains the line \"Just A Test!\". The mechanism is presumably used to check the functioning of a malicious program.\n\nThe file \"/test2/[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\" is uploaded to \"Yandex.Disk\" (PUT).
