Notably, USB drives were a common medium, with tactics such as malicious LNK files exploiting CVE-2010-2568, autorun.inf files, and trojanized portable applications like Firefox, Notepad++, and TrueCrypt. Some frameworks required manual execution by a human asset, indicating a potential insider threat. Exploits for vulnerabilities like MS10-033, CVE-2017-8570, and CVE-2017-11882 were also utilized in spearphishing attacks to deliver malware.",

The report also emphasizes the importance of maintaining air-gapped systems updated to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities and suggests implementing strict security measures on connected systems used alongside air-gapped networks to mitigate initial access risks."
