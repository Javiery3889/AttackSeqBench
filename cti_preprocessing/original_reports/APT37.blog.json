FireEye assesses with high confidence that APT37's activities are carried out on behalf of the North Korean government, based on malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. The group targets primarily South Korea, as well as Japan, Vietnam, and the Middle East, across various industry verticals such as chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and healthcare. APT37 has exploited vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP) and Adobe Flash, demonstrating access to zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and the ability to incorporate them into operations."
