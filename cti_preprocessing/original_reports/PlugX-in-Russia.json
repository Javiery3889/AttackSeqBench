        "Initial Access": "Proofpoint researchers observed a campaign targeting telecom and military sectors in Russia, which began in July 2015 and continued into August. The campaign involved spear-phishing emails with exploit-laden Microsoft Word document attachments and links leading to RAR archives containing the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT). The emails and attachments were crafted in Russian, with filenames and decoy content relevant to the targets' interests, such as telecom terms and military events. The attackers, believed to operate out of China and tracked as TA459, have previously targeted military installations in Central Asia.",
        "Execution": "The PlugX RAT was delivered via spear-phishing emails using Microsoft Word document attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or RAR archives from fake domains. The RAR SFX executables dropped and loaded PlugX, employing DLL side-loading techniques to load the payload. The clean signed executable 'fsguidll.exe' was used to sideload 'fslapi.dll', which unpacked code from 'fslapi.dll.gui'. The variant of PlugX used was the P2P version, which included a range of features such as keylogging, screenshots, and persistence through service and run key installation.",
        "Persistence": "The PlugX RAT established persistence through service and run key installation. The configuration included settings for persistence, such as the service name 'sWtDmsuBTyMK', service display name, service description, registry hive, registry key, and registry value. The malware was designed to maintain its foothold on systems across restarts and other interruptions.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The PlugX RAT employed sandbox evasion techniques by not executing the payload until the victim closed the decoy Word document. This technique is designed to avoid detection in malware sandbox environments unless configured to simulate user actions. Additionally, the RAR SFX script was created with a Chinese language pack version of WinRAR, indicating an attempt to evade detection based on language or regional settings.",

These domains pointed to infrastructure on the IP address '43.252.175.119' in Hong Kong, actively used by the attacker since at least 2014.

        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The campaign by TA459 demonstrates a keen interest in the Russian telecom and military sectors, indicative of an actor with geopolitical motives. The attacker adapts and evolves their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) over time. Despite not hiding their tracks, they remain highly determined and persistent, with a sustained operation spanning at least two years. The attacker researches the locale and current events relevant to their targets, leveraging this in their targeting tactics. Organizations are advised to adopt next-generation solutions that correlate advanced detection with threat intelligence about actor TTPs and global views of threat traffic, including indicators of compromise (IOCs), to detect and mitigate compromises."
