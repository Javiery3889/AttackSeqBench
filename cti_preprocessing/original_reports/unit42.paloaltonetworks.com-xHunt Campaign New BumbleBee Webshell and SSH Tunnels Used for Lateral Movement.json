        "Others": "In September 2020, Unit 42 of Palo Alto Networks began investigating a compromised Microsoft Exchange server at a Kuwaiti organization, which was part of an ongoing xHunt campaign. The investigation led to the discovery of two new backdoors, TriFive and Snugy, and a new webshell named BumbleBee. The BumbleBee webshell was used to upload and download files, execute commands for system discovery, and facilitate lateral movement to other servers within the network. The threat actor utilized VPNs and SSH tunnels to interact with BumbleBee webshells on internal servers not directly accessible from the internet. Commands executed via BumbleBee included network and account discovery, system time determination, SSH tunnel creation, and RDP usage for lateral movement. The actor also removed evidence of their presence by deleting the BumbleBee webshell after use. The external servers used for SSH tunnels were associated with known xHunt infrastructure. The actor's activities, including the use of VPNs and specific commands, suggest a preference for concealing their location and a focus on evading detection. Palo Alto Networks' Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from these attacks with Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, and DNS Security subscriptions."
