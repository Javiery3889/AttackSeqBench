Miners such as OSAMiner, Black-T, and Pro-Ocean have features to erase traces of malicious activity. RTM APT group used packers as a service to bypass security tools, complicating the search for known signatures. However, behavioral analysis in sandboxes can detect malicious activity.",

Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server (ProxyLogon) and Accellion FTA were popular among attackers. The targeting of virtual infrastructure and software developers, as well as cloud services, was notable. Attacks on telecom companies doubled, with a focus on obtaining data, particularly related to 5G technology. Governmental institutions remained the most frequently attacked, with malware and social engineering being the primary methods used. The report emphasizes the importance of installing security updates and protecting virtual infrastructure to mitigate cyber threats."
