The group uses a variety of programming languages and simple tools designed to gather sensitive information and spread further. They do not seem to make efforts to stay under the radar, focusing on spreading quickly and exfiltrating data. The group uses many different domains for C&C servers, both free and paid, and changes them frequently. They also use separate domains for small groups of victims. Despite errors in their tools, the group's rapid execution and adaptation create a state of constant dread in their targets. Persistence techniques include scheduled tasks, autorun registry keys, and leveraging the Startup folder. The group's strategy of installing multiple scripts and executables on each system and constantly updating them complicates defenders' efforts."
