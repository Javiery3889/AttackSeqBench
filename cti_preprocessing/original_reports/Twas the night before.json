They compromised a larger number of sites, including valuable Saudi government identities, and continued to rely on social engineering. The group's specific target set suggests that Saudi security teams should update their web applications and plugins to protect against this APT's activities. The group is expected to continue targeting Saudi Arabian organizations and may expand to other organizations connected to Saudi interests."
