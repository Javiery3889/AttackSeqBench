        "Command and Control": "The Threat Research Team at Fidelis Cybersecurity has been monitoring the lifecycle of Commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs), including H-W0rm, njRAT, KilerRAT, DarkComet, Netwire, XtremeRAT, JSocket/AlienSpy/Adwind, and others. H-W0rm, also known as Hworm, is particularly active, with infections observed across various enterprise verticals and geographies. Technical descriptions of H-W0rm's payload behavior when installed on a victim machine include collecting system information, file management, remote desktop capture, keylogging, collecting passwords from web browsers, webcam and microphone access, running remote applications or scripts, updating the RAT, closing the connection, and uninstalling the RAT. Artifacts have been found correlating Hworm C2 domains with njRAT, XtremeRAT, and DarkComet. Yara rules have been provided to detect the VBS and PE versions of H-W0rm.",

        "Others": "The Fidelis Cybersecurity Threat Research Team has supplemented recent reports by providing technical descriptions of H-W0rm payload behavior, domains observed in active infections, and artifacts correlating Hworm C2 domains with other RATs. They have also shared Yara rules for detection and a list of C2 domains seen in the past six months. Speculation exists in the research community about connections between the developers of Houdini, njRAT, and BlackWorm. Some versions of Hworm include network traffic that reveals information about antivirus tools installed on infected systems, such as Microsoft Security Essentials, Symantec Endpoint Protection, McAfee VirusScan Enterprise, ESET Smart Security, and Windows Defender. Despite the presence of these tools, the malware was not removed from memory, indicating a potential evasion or disabling of the antivirus software. Fidelis Cybersecurity emphasizes the importance of a layered network security approach to protect endpoints from such threats."
