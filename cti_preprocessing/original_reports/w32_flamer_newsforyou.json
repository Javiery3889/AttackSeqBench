        "Command and Control": "The C&C servers for W32.Flamer were managed through a Web application called Newsforyou, which processed client interactions and provided a control panel for attackers to upload code packages and download stolen data.

        "Others": "The forensic analysis of the W32.Flamer C&C servers revealed that the servers were operational since at least 2012, with the first server set up on May 18, 2012, and the second on March 25, 2012. The analysis also uncovered the nicknames of four authors who worked on the code, indicating a collaborative and ongoing development effort. The C&C servers were part of a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign targeting the Middle East, with the malware being modular in design and containing novel functionality. The attackers employed data security compartmentalization techniques, indicating a highly organized and sophisticated group behind the operation. The investigation provided insights into the architecture of the threat and the command structure of the entities behind it, suggesting the involvement of a large and well-funded entity."
