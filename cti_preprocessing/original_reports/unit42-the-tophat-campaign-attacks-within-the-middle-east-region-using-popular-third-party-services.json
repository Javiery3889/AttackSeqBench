The self-extracting executables loaded a decoy document and spawned an instance of Scote malware.",

The attacker tested their malware against multiple security products and submitted files that appear to be new variants of the DustySky Core malware. The campaign leveraged political events to target individuals or organizations within the Palestine region. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by this threat through tagging in AutoFocus, flagging of malicious domains, marking samples as malicious within WildFire, and blocking exploits used by the RTF files. Google, Pastebin, and bit.ly have been notified of the malicious content hosted on their services."
