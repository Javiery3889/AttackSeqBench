The report outlines the evolution of NSO Group's capabilities, including the deployment of six distinct zero-click exploits for iOS since at least 2017. The report also discusses the 'observed update deficit' metric, indicating the duration fully up-to-date devices were vulnerable to exploits while deployed in the wild. Additionally, the report suggests that Google Project Zero's 2019 investigation may have disrupted NSO Group's activities. The report emphasizes the importance of collaboration between human rights defenders, civil society investigators, and private sector security researchers to understand the capabilities of private sector offensive actors."
