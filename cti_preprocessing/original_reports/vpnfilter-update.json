        "Others": "On June 6, 2018, Cisco Talos, in collaboration with intelligence partners, updated their findings on the VPNFilter malware. The malware now targets more devices, including those from ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti, UPVEL, and ZTE, in addition to previously affected Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, and TP-Link devices. Notably, no Cisco devices are impacted. A new stage 3 module, 'ssler', intercepts web traffic on port 80, enabling the injection of malicious content into network traffic, thus extending the threat to networks supported by compromised devices. Another stage 3 module, 'dstr', can disable devices by deleting files necessary for operation, effectively hiding the malware's presence and preventing the device from booting. Further analysis of the stage 3 packet sniffer, 'ps', reveals its capability to monitor Industrial Control System (ICS) traffic and capture HTTP basic authentication credentials. The threat from VPNFilter is evolving, with the potential to deploy additional capabilities such as rootkits, exfiltration tools, and destructive malware. Talos continues to monitor the situation, with assistance from the global research community, to protect customers and inform the public. An updated list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), including Command and Control (C2) domains, IPs, file hashes, and affected devices, is provided. The list may still be incomplete, and the scope of affected devices could be broader."
