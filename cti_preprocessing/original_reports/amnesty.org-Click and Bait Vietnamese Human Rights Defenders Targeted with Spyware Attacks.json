        "Initial Access": "A new Amnesty International investigation has identified a campaign of spyware attacks targeting Vietnamese human rights defenders (HRDs) from February 2018 to November 2020. The attacks were conducted by an attack group known as Ocean Lotus, which has been active since at least 2014. The group targeted HRDs with emails pretending to share important documents, either containing spyware as an attachment or as a link. Once downloaded and launched, the spyware would open a decoy document to trick the victim into believing the file was benign.",

        "Others": "Amnesty International's Security Lab attributes these spyware attacks to Ocean Lotus, which has been active since at least 2014, targeting the private sector and HRDs. The attacks are part of a crackdown on freedom of expression in Vietnam and against Vietnamese activists outside the country. The Vietnamese government has intensified repression linked to online activity over the past 15 years, leading to harassment, intimidation, physical assault, and prosecution. The Law on Cybersecurity, effective January 2019, grants the government broad powers to limit online freedom. Ocean Lotus has developed a sophisticated spyware toolkit, including Mac OS, Android, and Windows spyware, and strategically compromises websites for further targeting. The group has targeted HRDs and civil society, with a focus on Vietnamese and neighboring countries' rights and media groups. The investigation revealed that two HRDs and a non-profit human rights organization from Vietnam were targeted by a coordinated spyware campaign, allowing full monitoring of compromised systems. The Windows spyware identified was a variant of a malware family called Kerrdown, used exclusively by Ocean Lotus, which downloaded Cobalt Strike, a commercial spyware toolkit. The Mac OS Spyware was a variant of a malware family developed and used exclusively by Ocean Lotus. The targeted surveillance led by Ocean Lotus is part of a broader pattern of censorship and criminalization of online expression in Vietnam. Recommendations include conducting an independent investigation into the unlawful targeted surveillance and implementing a human rights regulatory framework governing surveillance. Protection measures against such attacks include being cautious with emails, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping systems up to date, and using antivirus software."
