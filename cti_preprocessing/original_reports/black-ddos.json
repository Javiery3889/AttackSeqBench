        "Execution": "Cybercriminals use Black Energy 2, detected as Backdoor.Win32.Blakken by Kaspersky Lab, to execute malicious activities on infected computers. The malware hides its code from antivirus products using encryption and code compression, and it infects system processes. Upon execution, Black Energy 2 allocates virtual memory, copies its decryptor code, and passes control to the decryptor, which then places dropper functionality code in memory. A decryptor driver with a random name is created in the system32drivers directory, and a corresponding service is started. The driver acts as a wrapper for the malware's core components.",
        "Persistence": "Black Energy 2 maintains persistence by injecting a DLL into the svchost.exe user-mode process. The infector driver, which contains the malicious DLL, locates the svchost.exe process, allocates memory in its address space, and launches the injected library's code using APC queue processing.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "Black Energy 2 evades defenses by hiding its payload using encryption, code compression, and potentially anti-emulation techniques. The malware's plugins are not executable files and are loaded directly onto an infected machine, which means they may not be distributed using mass propagation techniques, making it harder for antivirus vendors to detect new plugins.",

        "Command and Control": "The botnet's command-and-control (C&C) center communicates with Black Energy 2 through HTTP requests. The bot sends a preformed HTTP request containing data that identifies the infected machine. The C&C responds with a bot configuration file, which is an encrypted XML document. The bot can receive general commands from the C&C, such as downloading and executing files, updating the bot, and setting contact frequency with the C&C server.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "Black Energy 2 is primarily used to conduct DDoS attacks. It uses plugins like ddos, syn, and http to initiate mass connections and send random data packets to target servers. The malware can create a significant load on servers, especially when using the http plugin, which imitates an ordinary user visiting a page multiple times in a short period.",
        "Others": "Kaspersky Lab has identified over 4,000 modifications of Black Energy 2 since mid-2008. The malware has evolved to include plugins that extend its capabilities beyond DDoS attacks, potentially allowing for spam distribution, credential grabbing, and proxy server setup. Kaspersky Lab continues to monitor the evolution of Black Energy 2 and its plugins to track the threat's progression."
