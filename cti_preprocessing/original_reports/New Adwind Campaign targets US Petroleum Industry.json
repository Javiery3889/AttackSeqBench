The campaign utilizes multi-layer obfuscation to evade detection, with multiple RAT samples hosted on the serving domain 'members[.]westnet[.]com[.]au/~joeven/'. The attacker has either used or compromised a Westnet user account to host the RAT. The payload is executed by the victim, involving multiple levels of JAR extractions.",
        "Execution": "The Adwind RAT executes a dropped JAR payload, which creates a parent Java process and copies itself into the %User% directory. It then performs three actions: executes the copy, creates a registry entry in HKCU/CurrentVersion/Run for persistence, and creates WMI scripts in %temp% to disable firewall and antivirus services. Subsequent JARs perform AES decryption routines and execute as new Java threads, leading to the loading of the JRAT class responsible for major RAT functionality.",

        "Command and Control": "The JRAT class within the Adwind RAT tries connecting to its command and control server at the IP address 185[.]205[.]210[.]48. It encrypts and exfiltrates data to this server.",

The VirusTotal detection ratio for the top-level JAR was 5/56, while that of the final decrypted JAR was 49/58. The campaign has been active over the last couple of years, with the RAT supporting cross-platform functionality for Windows, Linux, and Mac."
