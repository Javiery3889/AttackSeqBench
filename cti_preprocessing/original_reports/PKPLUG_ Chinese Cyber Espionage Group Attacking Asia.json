The group targets countries and regions in and around Southeast Asia, with potential motivations related to the ASEAN organization, China's Belt and Road Initiative, and disputes over the South China Sea. Unit 42 of Palo Alto Networks has been tracking PKPLUG for three years and believes with high confidence that it has origins linked to Chinese nation-state adversaries. The group's use of Android malware indicates an intent to target environments where traditional computing and communication methods differ."
