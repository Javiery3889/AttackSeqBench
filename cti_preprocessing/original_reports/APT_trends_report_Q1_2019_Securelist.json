The attack targeted a specific pool of users, identified by their network adapter MAC addresses. Over 600 unique MAC addresses were extracted from more than 200 Trojanized samples, although it's possible that other samples exist targeting different MAC addresses.",

Russian-speaking groups continued their non-stop activity with a focus on political activity, including an attack on the Ukraine elections and targeting political organizations engaged in the 2019 European Parliament elections. Turla targeted government bodies in Turkmenistan and Tajikistan using new .NET malware called 'Topinambour'. Zebrocy added the 'Go' language to its arsenal and targeted Central Asian government-related organizations. A highly targeted attack in Crimea using previously unknown malware was also observed.\n\nChinese-speaking actors were active, targeting countries in South East Asia. The US DOJ indicted two Chinese nationals, alleged members of APT10, for computer hacking and other charges. CactusPete targeted organizations in South Korea, Japan, the US, and Taiwan. LuckyMouse targeted Vietnamese government and diplomatic entities. APT40 targeted engineering, transportation, and defense industries, especially maritime technologies.\n\nIn South East Asia and the Korean peninsula, Transparent Tribe focused on Indian military targets. A campaign targeting military organizations in India was identified, using watering-holes and spear-phishing to distribute Netwire RAT. OceanLotus used a new downloader called KerrDown and targeted Mac OS. Lazarus and Kimsuky targeted cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nIn the Middle East, activity was less intense, but Chafer and Bitter targeted the region. Gaza Team and MuddyWater also showed activity.\n\nOther discoveries included a new version of the FinSpy iOS implant, a new Android version exploiting the DirtyCow vulnerability, and an exploited zero-day vulnerability in 'win32k.sys' (CVE-2019-0797) used by FruityArmor and SandCat. Ransomware attacks, such as LockerGoga, were used to delete traces or as a distraction, targeting companies like Altran and Norsk Hydro."
