The campaign involved masquerading as a member of Cambridge University to gain victims' trust to open malicious documents and using LinkedIn to deliver these documents. The targeted employee received a file via a LinkedIn message from 'Rebecca Watts', who claimed to be 'Research Staff at University of Cambridge'. The conversation began with the solicitation of resumes for potential job opportunities.",

TONEDEAF is a backdoor that communicates with a command and control (C2) server using HTTP GET and POST requests, supporting system information collection, file uploading and downloading, and arbitrary shell command execution.",

FireEye's platform successfully thwarted the attempted intrusion, stopping the new malware variant. FireEye also initiated a Community Protection Event titled 'Geopolitical Spotlight: Iran' to update customers with new discoveries, activity, and detection efforts related to this campaign and other recent activity from Iranian-nexus threat actors."
