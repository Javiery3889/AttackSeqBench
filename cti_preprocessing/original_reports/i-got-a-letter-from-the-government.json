        "Initial Access": "The CTI report details Operation Manul, which involved spearphishing attempts to deliver malware to targets. The spearphishing emails often contained an invoice or legal document with an attachment that included a blurry image. These emails were sent to journalists, dissidents, their family members, associates, and lawyers involved in litigation with the government of Kazakhstan. The malware used in these attempts was linked to Command and Control servers that hosted web-based control panels for multiple RATs, indicating the operation of several campaigns simultaneously.",
        "Execution": "The report identifies two malware families used in Operation Manul: JRat and Bandook. JRat is a cross-platform RAT with functionalities such as keylogging, reverse proxy, password recovery, webcam control, and more. Bandook targets Windows computers and can perform actions like screen capture, webcam recording, audio recording, file manipulation, and spawning a shell. Both RATs are commercially available and have been used to target a variety of systems.",

        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The JRat malware contains anti-analysis features, including code obfuscation using Zendix Klass Master (ZKM) and anti-virtualization techniques to detect and shut down if run in a virtualized environment. Bandook also employs evasion techniques, such as process hollowing and checking for virtualized environments before execution.",

These domains were linked to multiple IP addresses and were associated with the operation's malware campaigns. The C2 infrastructure suggests that the attackers managed multiple operations against different targets at the same time.",
        "Exfiltration": "None",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The report suggests links between Operation Manul and the government of Kazakhstan, as well as potential connections to Arcanum Global Intelligence and an Indian security company called Appin Security Group. The report also notes that the malware campaign is likely carried out on behalf of the government of Kazakhstan against individuals involved in legal disputes with the government. Additionally, the report includes an analysis of the network infrastructure shared between Operation Manul and Operation Hangover, indicating shared servers and domains at the same time."
