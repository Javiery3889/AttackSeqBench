Activity Groups are defined by similarities in features or processes and are weighted by confidence. They are dynamic and change over time to incorporate new knowledge about adversaries. The report emphasizes that Activity Groups are not static and must be updated to maintain accuracy. The creation of an Activity Group involves selecting features, classifying events, and analyzing the groups to address specific analytic problems. The report also discusses the challenges of naming and correlating activities across different organizations due to the complexity of classification and the need for a shared grouping function and feature vector."
