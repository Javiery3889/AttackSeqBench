During the investigation, an archive containing files from the C2 server was provided, which included web server configuration files and a MySQL database reflecting research activity. The attackers targeted specific organizations, including Cisco, through the delivery of a second-stage loader. The C2 tracking database indicated that at least 20 victim machines were served specialized secondary payloads.",
        "Execution": "The web directory from the C2 server contained PHP files responsible for controlling communications with infected systems. The PHP files included checks to determine whether to proceed with standard operations or redirect to the legitimate Piriform website. The PHP script contained references to the required table for information storage within the 'x.php' variables. The 'init.php' file defined core variables and operations, specifying 'PRC' as the time zone and the database configuration to use. The PHP script compared the system beaconing to the C2 to three values: $DomainList, $IPList, and $HostList, to determine if the infected system should be delivered a Stage 2 payload. The attackers controlled which infected systems were delivered a Stage 2 payload, with 20 unique hosts identified as affected.",

The x86 version used a trojanized TSMSISrv.dll, while the x64 version dropped a trojanized EFACli64.dll. The setup put an encoded PE in the registry, which was executed by the trojanized files. The stage 3 payload reached out to additional C2 servers and executed in-memory PE files. A lightweight backdoor module in the registry retrieved an IP from data steganographically hidden in a GitHub or WordPress search, from which an additional PE module was downloaded and run. Talos reviewed claims of code overlap with malware samples known to be used by Group 72, confirming the overlap. The attack was sophisticated, targeting technology companies through a supply chain attack to compromise a large number of victims persistently, in hopes to land payloads on computers at specific target networks. Indicators of compromise associated with the attack were provided."
