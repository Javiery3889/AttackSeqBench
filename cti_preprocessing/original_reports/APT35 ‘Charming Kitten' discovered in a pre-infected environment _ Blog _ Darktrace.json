The post highlights the value of self-learning AI in detecting pre-existing infections and 'low and slow' attacks. Darktrace's Proactive Threat Notifications and Antigena could have autonomously enforced normal activity for the device, preventing the C2 traffic without interrupting regular business workflows."
