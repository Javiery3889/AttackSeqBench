The rules, authored by Kaspersky Lab, were last modified on 2015-06-09 and are designed to identify Duqu 2.0 loaders and drivers. The loaders are detected by strings such as unique identifiers, pipe names, and SQL queries, as well as references to MSI.dll and command-line arguments. The drivers are identified by device names, user accounts, and specific function calls. The file sizes for loaders and drivers are restricted to less than 100,000 and 200,000 bytes, respectively.",
