This file is then saved as a portable executable file named 'gup.exe' and executed using a version of the certutil.exe tool named 'Temptcm.tmp'. The FlowCloud macro introduced a new method for the delivery of the malware, utilizing a previously unobserved macro section to download the payload from a DropBox URL.

They continued their analysis into additional LookBack campaigns that unfolded between August 21-29, 2019. These campaigns utilized malicious macro-laden documents to deliver modular malware to targeted utility providers across the U.S. At the same time, Proofpoint identified a new malware family named FlowCloud, which gives attackers complete control over a compromised system. Both LookBack and FlowCloud malware can be attributed to a single threat actor called TA410, based on shared attachment macros, malware installation techniques, and overlapping delivery infrastructure. TA410 campaigns detected in November 2019 included TA429 (APT10)-related infrastructure used in phishing attachment delivery macros. However, Proofpoint analysts believe that intentional reuse of TA429 (APT10) techniques and infrastructure may be an attempt by threat actors to create a false flag. Therefore, they do not attribute LookBack and FlowCloud campaigns to TA429 (APT10) and track TA429 (APT10) independently of TA410 campaigns."
