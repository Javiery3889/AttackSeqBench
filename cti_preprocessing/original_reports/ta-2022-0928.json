        "Others": "The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is implementing a strategy of 'precise communication' to tailor its propaganda to specific international audiences. This approach adapts market segmentation tactics to design content and dissemination methods that appeal to the preferences of target groups. The CCP's intent is to influence global audiences in ways beneficial to its interests. The strategy involves in-depth understanding of target audiences, achieved through research, surveys, and online behavioral data, often with the aid of international firms. The CCP's external propaganda apparatus is likely to continue expanding global data collection, leveraging advertising data, and evolving tactics to circumvent data privacy laws. Party-state media is among the leading implementers of precise communication, but a wide range of actors are also likely involved. The content disseminated is becoming increasingly diverse, tailored first according to country differences and then based on community-level characteristics. New forms of media, such as online influencers and newsletters, are likely to continue proliferating. The CCP's strategy for targeted propaganda includes segmenting audiences based on individual, community, or country-level characteristics such as culture, economic development, religious faith, customs, and personal interests. The CCP's propaganda output, from news distribution through third parties to TV show production and online activities, is intended to influence all of the CCP's propaganda output. The CCP is striving to seize the 'right to speak' and 'set the agenda' internationally, shaping perceptions and behaviors of global audiences. The CCP's strategic concepts for conducting 'external propaganda' have matured over the last 20 years, with efforts to expand party-state news media globally and focus on localization. The CCP's use of online disinformation and computational propaganda has increased, particularly in response to events like the Hong Kong protests and the COVID-19 pandemic. The CCP's propaganda apparatus has become more coercive, with a surge in Chinese diplomats on global social media platforms. Inauthentic campaigns and online personalities have become staples of CCP propaganda. The CCP is also focusing on new technologies like bulk data collection and artificial intelligence to enhance propaganda work. The precise communication concept is almost certainly intended to influence all of the CCP's propaganda output."
