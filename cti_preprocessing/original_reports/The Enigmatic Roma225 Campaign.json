The downloaded web page, while appearing benign, concealed VBScript code in an invisible blog post. This script was falsely attributed to 'Microsoft Corp.' and was responsible for executing a series of malicious actions, including storing a base64 encoded version of the 'RevengeRAT' payload in the registry, decoding and executing the payload, and creating and executing another VBScript to download a new payload from 'hxxp://cdtmaster.com[.]br'.",

Its sole purpose was to deploy and run the 'Outlook.exe' payload. The 'Outlook.exe' payload, when executed, did not show any immediate signs of activity but opened a listening TCP socket on localhost. The researchers were still analyzing the 'Outlook.exe' sample to determine its true behavior. The attack could not be attributed to a specific threat actor, but there were common TTPs with previous reports, such as the use of shared infrastructure as a drop-server and the use of popular RATs as backdoors. The domain 'cdtmaster.com[.]br' also hosted other suspicious files, including a variant of 'njRAT'. The indicators of compromise included various URLs and IP addresses associated with the campaign, as well as a registry key used for persistence. Yara rules were provided for detection of related malware samples."
