        "Initial Access": "Late last year, a wave of cyber-attacks hit several critical sectors in Ukraine. The BlackEnergy APT group, known for targeting Ukraine, utilized Excel documents with macros to drop the BlackEnergy Trojan if the user enabled the script. A new attack vector was identified involving a Microsoft Word document named \"$RR143TB.doc\" (md5: e15b36c2e394d599a8ab352159089dd2), which was uploaded from Ukraine on January 20, 2016. The document, created on 2015-07-27, enticed users to enable macros to view content related to the \"Right Sector\" party in Ukraine. The payload, \"vba_macro.exe\" (md5: ac2d7f21c826ce0c449481f79138aebd), executed upon enabling macros, dropped a DLL file as \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\FONTCACHE.DAT\" and ensured persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder. The final payload connected to a C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114, which is currently offline.",
        "Execution": "Upon enabling macros in the malicious Word document, the macro built a string in memory containing a file named \"vba_macro.exe\". This file was then executed using the Shell command, leading to the execution of the BlackEnergy dropper.",

The server, previously mentioned by ESET, is currently offline or limiting connections by IP address. If online, the malware would issue an HTTP POST request, sending basic victim info and requesting commands. The request is BASE64 encoded and contains fields such as b_id and b_gen, which include a build id and a unique machine identifier.",

        "Impact": "The BlackEnergy APT group's attacks in Ukraine indicate a focus on destructive actions, compromising industrial control installations, and espionage activities.
