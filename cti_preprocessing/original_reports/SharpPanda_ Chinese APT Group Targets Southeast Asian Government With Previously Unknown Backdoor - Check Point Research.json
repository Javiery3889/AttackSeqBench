The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents to gain initial access. These emails were sometimes spoofed to appear as if they were from other government-related entities. The attachments contained weaponized copies of legitimate-looking official documents that employed the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.",
        "Execution": "The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor on victims' machines. The RTF files used in the attack were weaponized using a variant of a tool named RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word. The initial documents and RTF files initiated a multi-stage infection chain, ultimately leading to the execution of malicious code.",
        "Persistence": "The attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' that was intended to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day. This task was set up by the shellcode within the RTF document to maintain the foothold on the system.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques throughout the infection chain. The loader used anti-sandboxing techniques and gathered data on the victim's computer, which was then encrypted and sent to the C&C server. The loader also decrypted and executed shellcode that was stored encrypted within the binary, using dynamic API resolving to hide its main functionality and avoid static detection of suspicious API calls.",
        "Credential Access": "None",
        "Discovery": "The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters. It also queried WMI for anti-virus information. This data was collected for the attackers to assess the value of the compromised machine.",
        "Lateral Movement": "None",
        "Collection": "The backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information. This data collection was integral to the attackers' surveillance objectives.",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using a configuration that contained the server IP and port. It sent a 'Start conversation' message and received a 'Get Victim Information' message in return. The communication was encrypted and followed a specific format involving XORed TypeID and Data with a 256-byte key.",
        "Exfiltration": "The backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel. The communication protocol involved sending various types of data, including screenshots, files, and system information, back to the attackers through the established C&C channel.",
        "Impact": "The backdoor had the capability to shut down the victim's computer, which could be used to disrupt operations and impact the availability of the system.",
        "Others": "The operation was attributed to a Chinese APT group that has been refining its tools for at least 3 years. The C&C servers operated in a limited daily window, and the backdoor C&C server was hosted on a US-based provider widely used by multiple threat actors. The attackers' infrastructure included first-stage C&C servers hosted by cloud services in Asia and a backdoor C&C server hosted on Zenlayer. The activity cluster was attributed to a Chinese threat group based on artifacts and indicators such as the use of RoyalRoad RTF exploit building kit, the timing of C&C server activity, and submissions of test backdoor versions to VirusTotal from China."
