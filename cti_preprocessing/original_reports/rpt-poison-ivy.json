These methods are designed to entice targets to open attachments containing the malicious Poison Ivy server code or redirect them to exploit-laden websites.",
        "Execution": "The Poison Ivy builder kit allows attackers to customize and build their own Poison Ivy server, which is delivered as mobile code to a target that has been compromised, typically using social engineering. The server executes on the target's endpoint and connects to the attacker's client, giving them control of the system.",

The key is derived from a password provided by the attacker when building the Poison Ivy server. The protocol operates by sending encrypted data in chunks with a 32-byte header.",

        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The report details the use of Poison Ivy (PIVY), a RAT that remains popular and effective despite its age. FireEye has released Calamine, a set of tools to help detect and examine Poison Ivy infections. The report includes analysis of 194 Poison Ivy samples used in targeted attacks, extracting passwords, mutexes, and CnC infrastructure. It also provides insights into the tools, tactics, and procedures of the attackers, exploring campaign connections and enabling defenders to better secure their networks."
