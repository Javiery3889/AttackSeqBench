These emails contained compressed executables or phishing links, with fake sources used to deliver the emails to victims.",
        "Resource Development": "The malware used in the attacks, based on the Hawkeye commercial spyware, was designed to collect a variety of data from the victim's device, including passwords, keystrokes, and screenshots. This commercial off-the-shelf malware provided anonymity for the attackers, making attribution more difficult.",
        "Initial Access": "The initial access to the victim's network was achieved through spear phishing emails that included a 7z file with a malware executable disguised as a payment instruction document. The emails targeted senior members and executives within the organizations.",
        "Execution": "Upon execution, the malware self-deployed and configured persistence using anti-debugging and timeout techniques. It then began collecting data from the victim's device, such as keystrokes, clipboard data, and account data from various applications and clients.",
        "Persistence": "The malware established persistence on the victim's device to maintain access and continue its data collection activities.",

        "Collection": "The malware collected data such as keystrokes, clipboard data, and account information from various sources on the victim's device.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware communicated with a command center at the IP address 192.169.82.86 to deliver collected information, which included passwords, clipboard data, and screenshots. The IP address appeared to belong to a compromised device running multiple malware campaigns.",
        "Exfiltration": "Data exfiltration was primarily conducted via HTTP GET posts sent to the IP address 192.169.82.86 and email messages sent to addresses associated with compromised organizations operating in manufacturing and technology services.",
        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The attackers targeted over 130 organizations in more than 30 countries, focusing on industrial, engineering, and manufacturing sectors. The campaign, traced back to March 2015, seemed financially motivated. The attackers were particularly active in the Middle East, with a significant number of victims located in the United Arab Emirates. Phishing pages and links were also used, with victims connecting from various devices including Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu, iPhone, and Android. Kaspersky Lab detected the malware using heuristic signatures and provided a list of indicators of compromise, including filenames, paths, MD5 hashes, domains, and phishing URLs related to the malware."
