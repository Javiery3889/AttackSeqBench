The report outlines the increased rate of cyberattacks in healthcare since the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant rise in ransomware attacks and other sophisticated techniques. BD's approach to cybersecurity involves collaboration with customers, vendors, industry regulators, and security researchers to improve healthcare resilience. The report also discusses internal and external risks, such as software vulnerabilities, insider threats, human error, phishing, and ransomware attacks, and BD's strategies to mitigate these risks through security by design, security in use, and security through partnership. Additionally, BD's initiatives for 2022 focus on enhancing cybersecurity across the organization, product security, manufacturing security, and IT security. The report concludes with a discussion on future cybersecurity trends, including the adoption of digital code-signing capabilities, SBOM requirements, risk assessments on third-party vendors, improved communication with customers and patients, prioritization of cybersecurity awareness, independent cybersecurity assessments, and cyber simulation activities."
