This server, which provides Javascript code to several Afghan government websites, was found to be serving malicious code. Visitors to websites such as the President of Afghanistan's site (www.president.gov.af) were affected. The attackers modified the Javascript file jquery-1.4.2.min.js hosted on the CDN to load additional malicious code from the IP address 176.58.101.24.",

The attackers have used similar tactics in past strategic web compromises. The primary network indicator for this activity is communication with the IP address 176.58.101.24, which is associated with Linode LLC and has ASN details provided by the Shadowserver IP-BGP service."
