They appear to have knowledge of their victims' whereabouts, including names and places of stay, suggesting advanced reconnaissance capabilities.",
        "Resource Development": "The Darkhotel APT has demonstrated the ability to compromise trusted commercial network resources on a global scale with strategic precision for years. They possess advanced mathematical and crypto-analytical offensive capabilities, allowing them to undermine the trust extended to Certificate Authorities and the PKI. They also maintain a larger, dynamic infrastructure built of Apache webservers, dynamic DNS records, crypto libraries, and PHP webapps.",
        "Initial Access": "The Darkhotel APT gains initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates for popular packages such as Google Toolbar, Adobe Flash, and Windows Messenger. They also seed Japanese P2P sharing sites with their malware, which is downloaded over 30,000 times in less than six months.",
        "Execution": "The Darkhotel APT deploys various malware components that execute on victims' systems. These include small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers. They also use 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer to execute malicious code.",
        "Persistence": "The Darkhotel APT maintains persistence on compromised systems through the use of malware that adds autorun registry settings for automatic start during system boot. They also employ a selective infector virus to infiltrate other computers via USB or network shares.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "None",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Darkhotel APT uses digital certificates to sign their backdoors, some of which require advanced mathematical capabilities to factorize the keys. They also employ techniques to encrypt and store gathered data in log files, using algorithms similar to RC4.",
        "Credential Access": "The Darkhotel APT's information stealer module targets stored secrets in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and various email services. It is designed to terminate itself on Windows systems with the default codepage set to Korean.",

        "Impact": "None",
        "Others": "The Darkhotel APT has been active for almost a decade and is known for its successful attacks against a wide range of victims worldwide. They have used both targeted and botnet-style campaigns, indicating a strong threat actor with sophisticated espionage tools. The APT's targeting of top executives during their stay at certain hotels is particularly notable, as it suggests the attackers have detailed knowledge of their victims' travel plans."
