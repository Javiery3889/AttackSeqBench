It consists of downloaders, and occasionally multiple intermediate loaders, that are intended to fetch and execute payload on victim machines. In two known cases, the initial stage of the framework was installed in the victim's UEFI firmware, achieving the above-OS level of persistence. When inspecting the compromised UEFI firmware, four components with unusual proximity in their assigned GUID values were noticed. These were two DXE drivers and two UEFI applications, compiled from the source code of a Hacking Team bootkit named VectorEDK, leaked in 2015. The components included SmmInterfaceBase, a DXE driver to deploy the bootkit; Ntfs, a driver to parse the NTFS file system; SmmReset, a UEFI application to mark bootkit execution; and SmmAccessSub, the main bootkit component serving as a persistent dropper for user-mode malware named 'IntelUpdate.exe'.",

It also mentions the use of mutexes, BITS job manipulation, DLL loading, and registry modifications for persistence and execution. Additionally, the report includes language artifacts, unique IDs, and C&C URLs associated with the threat actor's infrastructure."
