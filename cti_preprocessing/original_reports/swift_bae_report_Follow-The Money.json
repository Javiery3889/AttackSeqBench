It details the money laundering process in the context of large-scale cyber heists, including the preparatory activities, placement, layering, and integration phases. The report also discusses the role of money mules, front companies, cash businesses, and the use of cryptocurrencies in the laundering process. Additionally, it highlights the importance of information sharing, augmented sharing of risk factors, money-mule initiatives, compliance and reporting enhancements, and addressing insufficient cybersecurity as methods to mitigate money laundering risks. The report concludes that large-scale cyber heist attempts are expected to continue and evolve, emphasizing the need for continued focus on disrupting criminal activity throughout the money laundering process."
