The report, based on public and open sources, focused on malware such as TrickBot, TA505, and Dridex, believed to originate from Eastern Europe, and explored potential connections to DPRK threat actors. The key findings suggest that DPRK threat actors are likely active in the cybercriminal underground and maintain trusted relationships with top-tier Russian-speaking cybercriminals. Malware used by DPRK actors was likely delivered via network accesses held by these cybercriminals. The report also discusses the difficulty of attributing shared malware-as-a-service offerings like TrickBot to specific users due to the use of campaign identifiers (gtags). The analysis by Intel 471 and other researchers, such as those from Palo Alto's Unit 42, LEXFO, NTT Security, SentinelOne, Cybereason, and Proofpoint, indicates a probable link between DPRK threat actors and the operators or users of TrickBot. The report concludes that DPRK threat actors likely have multiple sources of network access, including those sold in the cybercriminal underground and obtained through social engineering. The report also includes annexes defining TA505 and clarifying the lack of a link between DPRK threat actors and the actors behind Dridex, as well as recommendations for protecting organizations from DPRK threat actors accessing networks through TrickBot infections."
