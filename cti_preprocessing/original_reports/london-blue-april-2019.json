They have also started spoofing email addresses of target company CEOs to add authenticity to their attacks. The group has amassed a new targeting database of nearly 8,500 financial executives from almost 7,800 different companies worldwide. Most companies targeted using spoofing techniques do not have a DMARC record established, and those that do often have policies set to p=none, which does not prevent spoofed emails from reaching their targets."
