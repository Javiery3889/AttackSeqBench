        "Initial Access": "A recent attack on a Japanese business involved the use of two malware families, PlugX and Elirks. The latter, a basic backdoor Trojan discovered in 2010, is used to steal information from compromised systems. Elirks retrieves its C2 address by accessing a predetermined microblog service or SNS, where attackers post encoded IP addresses or domain names of real C2 servers. A sample found in early 2016 contained embedded URLs from a Japanese blog service, and another sample from 2014 used a similar method, with the attacker's blog account still active.",

Similar tactics were used in the recent Japanese attack, with emails masquerading as legitimate companies and using aviation-related file names to lure targets. While there is no definitive evidence linking the same adversary to the attacks in Japan (2016) and Taiwan (2012), there are similarities in the use of malware, crafted spear-phishing emails, and interest in aviation-related targets. Palo Alto Networks continues to monitor these threat actors."
