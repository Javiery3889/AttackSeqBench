        "Defense Evasion": "On January 14, 2020, a blog post by JagaimoKawaii at lab52.io discussed updates to the ZXShell RootKit module used by APT27, also known as Emissary Panda. The RootKit, which operates with the highest level of privileges (Ring0), was found in a sample uploaded to VirusTotal on September 21, 2019. The sample is signed and functional on the latest version of Windows 10. Analyst Ori Damari (@0xrepnz) conducted a complete analysis of the RootKit's capabilities, which include file redirection and hiding network connections. The analysis revealed that the 2019 version of the RootKit made changes to avoid detection by obfuscating hardcoded strings and modifying code without impacting the driver's capabilities. Three notable changes were identified: reversing the list of strings identifying files to hide, disguising the use of the undocumented Microsoft API 'ObReferenceObjectByName', and moving part of the logic of some functions to different points in the code. The blog post includes a comparison of the old and new code, highlighting the differences in red and green.",
