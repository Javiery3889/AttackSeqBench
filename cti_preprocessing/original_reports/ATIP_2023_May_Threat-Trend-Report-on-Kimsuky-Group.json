Also, new top-level domains (TLDs) have begun to be detected, and there were small changes to the codes.\n\nAs mentioned above, the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) of all attack types showed a slight increase compared to those in April.\n\nFQDN by Attack Type in the Last 3 Months\n\nMar. 2023\n\n51Apr. 2023\n\nMay 2023\n\nFlowerPower\n\nRandomQuery\n\nAppleSeed\n\nFigure 1. FQDN statistics by attack type in the last 3 months (Unit: each)\n\nMajor Issues\n\n1) FlowerPower\n\nThis type is rarely found nowadays and there are no particular issues pertinent to it. However, while the previous first script collected system information from a function other than the main function, a variant that has the main function directly collect information was detected. This seems to be for the purpose of evading detection.\n\nFigure 2. Comparison of scripts\n\nNo other particular issues have been raised.\n\n2) RandomQuery\n\n(1) New TLD Found\n\nWhile it already uses an infiltrated Korean website for the C2, recently, scripts that use \".click\" and \".space\" as the TLD have been found. It has been identified that these TLDs are provided by \"value-server\"1, a Japanese web hosting company. These TLDs have the most affordable cost out of the options provided by the company, meaning that it is likely that the threat actor chose to use them to minimize the costs following the use of multiple C2 servers.\n\nFigure 3. TLDs provided by value-server\n\nAmong the scripts of this type, two variants that download additional files from cloud storage provided by a Korean portal website were found.\n\n1 https://www.value-server.com/\n\nFigure 4. Portions of the codes that download additional files\n\nOut of the two, one is password-protected and could not be examined, but the remaining one was a PDF file introducing a certain cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nSuch types that download these bait files have not been found in RandomQuery until now. Seeing from the content of the bait file, the attack targets are deemed to be personnel in the field of cryptocurrency or individuals with an interest in said field.\n\nFigure 5. Additionally downloaded bait file\n\n3) AppleSeed\n\nThere have been many logs where ngrok is downloaded at the end following an AppleSeed infection. No other particular issues pertaining to AppleSeed have been raised.\n\nHowever, ngrok is downloaded not from its official website but from a C2 built by the Kimsuky group. Like such, even original programs may be distributed from a source other than their official website.\n\nFinally, as mentioned in the January 2023 Threat Trend Report on Kimsuky Group2 released in March, ngrok is a tunneling program that enables access to a local computer from a remote location.\n\nBecause of this, connecting to an internal SSH via port forwarding becomes possible as well as forwarding to other protocols and internal directories, leaving the potential for vulnerability exploitation attacks.\n\n2 https://atip.ahnlab.com/ti/contents/regular-report/monthly?i=e1d770d2-bf96-41e2-a48f-fcade91ae1a6\n\nAhnLab Response Overview\n\nThe detection names and the engine version information of AhnLab products are shown below. Even if the activities of this threat group have been identified recently, AhnLab products may have already detected the related malware in the past. While ASEC is tracking the activities of this group and responding to related malware, there can be variants that have not been identified and thus are not detected.\n\nBackdoor/Win.AppleSeed (2023.05.26.01) Downloader/Powershell.Kimsuky.SC188250 (2023.05.08.02) Downloader/VBS.Agent.SC188885 (2023.05.24.00) Downloader/VBS.Agent.SC188886 (2023.05.24.00) Downloader/VBS.Agent.SC189044 (2023.06.02.00) Downloader/VBS.Generic (2023.05.23.00) Downloader/VBS.Kimsuky.S1997 (2023.05.10.02) Downloader/VBS.Kimsuky.SC188249 (2023.05.08.03) Downloader/VBS.Kimsuky.SC188251 (2023.05.09.00) Downloader/VBS.Kimsuky.SC188252 (2023.05.09.00) Downloader/VBS.Kimsuky.SC188448 (2023.05.16.00) Downloader/VBS.Kimsuky.SC188959 (2023.05.25.02) Dropper/CHM.Kimsuky (2023.05.17.00) Infostealer/PS.Browser (2023.05.08.03) Infostealer/PS.Browser (2023.05.09.00) Keylogger/PowerShell.Agent.SC188884 (2023.05.24.00) Trojan/PowerShell.Agent.SC186245 (2023.05.08.00) Trojan/Powershell.FlowerPower.SC188960 (2023.05.26.00) Trojan/Powershell.FlowerPower.SC188966 (2023.05.26.00) Trojan/Powershell.FlowerPower.SC189040 (2023.06.02.00) Trojan/Powershell.FlowerPower.SC189043 (2023.06.02.00) Trojan/PowerShell.KeyLogger (2023.05.09.00) Trojan/VBS.Kimsuky (2023.04.30.00) Trojan/VBS.Kimsuky (2023.05.02.00) Trojan/VBS.Kimsuky (2023.05.26.00) Trojan/Win.LightShell.C422328 (2023.05.04.03) Trojan/Win.TutRAT.R578309 (2023.05.16.00)\n\nIndicators Of Compromise (IOC)\n\nA portion of the following IOCs quotes other analysis reports, and there are some cases that could not be verified because samples could not be obtained.
