The attackers employed social engineering tactics, sending contextually relevant emails with malicious attachments that exploited vulnerabilities in popular software such as Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office. Notably, CVE-2010-3333, known as the 'Rich Text Format Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability', was frequently exploited. The malware used, identified as TROJ_WIMMIE or VBS_WIMMIE, leveraged Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence and communicated with command-and-control (C&C) servers via HTTP over port 80. The attackers utilized free web-hosting services for diverse domain names but also employed Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) for more stable operations.",

The attackers tested their malware in a virtual environment using a Chinese-language version of Windows XP. They also used anonymity tools like Tor and Tunnelier to obscure their locations and mailing software such as FoxMail and Supermailer for sending socially engineered emails. The campaign was connected to a hacker in the Chinese underground community, known by the nicknames 'dang0102' and 'scuhkr', who had ties to the Information Security Institute of Sichuan University."
