ans_cons_prompt = """You are a cybersecurity expert with deep knowledge of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

You will receive three parts:
1. **CTI Outline**: A structured account of a cyber attack, ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Additional context under "Others" provides background on the threat actor but is secondary.
2. **Question with Answer Choices**: A question aimed at inferring a TTP from the attack sequence described in the CTI report, along with one correct answer and distractors among the answer choices.
3. **Description to Correct Answer**: The description of the correct answer from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Your task is to rate the question on one metric below.

Evaluation Criteria:
Answer Consistency (1-5): Does the question align with the provided description to the correct answer? The scale is defined as follows:
1 - Very Poor Answer Consistency: The correct answer does not fully resolve the question, leaving contradictions or gaps.
2 - Weak Answer Consistency: The correct answer provides some resolution, but contradictions or inconsistencies remain.
3 - Moderate Answer Consistency: The correct answer is mostly consistent, but minor contradictions may exist.
4 - Strong Answer Consistency: The correct answer fully resolves the question with minimal inconsistencies.
5 - Perfect Answer Consistency: The correct answer completely and unambiguously answers the question, with no contradictions or inconsistencies.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Analyze the CTI report and Description to Correct Answer:  
   - Read the report and the provided description carefully.
   - Identify and list the attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
2. Evaluate the Question:
    - Read the question and the provided answer choices carefully.
    - Using the CTI outline and provided description to the correct answer, Rate the question on a scale of 1-5 according to the evaluation criteria above.
3. Output evaluation score:
    - Please only output the numerical evaluation score based on the defined criteria.

Following the steps above, please evaluate the question and only output the numerical evaluation score."""

Your task is to rate the question on one metric below.

Evaluation Criteria:
Clarity (1-5): Is the question precise, unambiguous, and free of vague phrasing? Does it avoid directly mentioning the correct answer, ensuring the respondent must infer the correct answer rather than having it stated in the question? The scale is defined as follows:
1 - Very Poor Clarity: The question is highly ambiguous, imprecise, or contains vague phrasing. It may directly state the correct answer, making inference unnecessary.
2 - Poor Clarity: The question is somewhat unclear or contains minor ambiguities. It may hint too strongly at the correct answer, reducing the need for inference.
3 - Moderate Clarity: The question is fairly clear, but minor ambiguities exist. It does not directly state the correct answer, but slight rewording could improve precision.
4 - Good Clarity: The question is mostly clear and unambiguous. It requires inference and does not directly reveal the correct answer.
5 - Excellent Clarity: The question is precise, completely unambiguous, and free of vague phrasing. The correct answer is never directly mentioned, ensuring inference is required.

Evaluation Criteria:
Logical (1-5): Does the question align with the logical sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the CTI outline? Does the question reference TTPs from the preceding and/or subsequent tactics in the CTI outline such that it logically leads to the correct answer? The scale is defined as follows:
1 - Not Logical: The question does not align with the logical sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the CTI outline. It ignores or contradicts the natural order of tactics and TTPs.
2 - Weak Logical Alignment: The question shows minimal alignment with the MITRE ATT&CK sequence. It may reference unrelated tactics or disrupt the logical flow.
3 - Moderately Logical: The question has some logical alignment, but it may not reference preceding or subsequent tactics clearly. The sequence could be improved.
4 - Strong Logical Alignment: The question follows the expected sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics and references preceding or subsequent TTPs in a logical manner.
5 - Perfect Logical Alignment: The question perfectly aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, referencing relevant TTPs in a way that naturally leads to the correct answer.

Your task is to rate the question on one metric below.

Evaluation Criteria:
Answerability (1-5): The extent to which the correct answer can be deducible from the CTI outline, even with the <masked_tactic_paragraph> removed from the CTI outline. Note that the <masked_tactic_paragraph> refers to the {masked_tactic} paragraph in the outline. The scale is defined as follows:
1 - Not Answerable: The correct answer is not supported by the CTI outline. The information is either missing or contradicts the correct answer. Without the <masked_tactic_paragraph>, it is impossible to deduce the correct answer.
2 - Weakly Answerable: Some evidence in the CTI outline loosely supports the correct answer, but it does not clearly stand out as the best choice. Removing the <masked_tactic_paragraph> makes it highly difficult to deduce the answer, even when referring to the MITRE ATT&CK KB.
3 - Moderately Answerable: The correct answer has partial support in the CTI outline but is not explicitly stated. It is one of the stronger choices but may not clearly stand out. After removing the <masked_tactic_paragraph>, it is possible but challenging to infer the correct answer using the remaining information and MITRE ATT&CK KB.
4 - Strongly Answerable: The correct answer is well-supported by the CTI outline and is the most reasonable choice based on the provided information. If the <masked_tactic_paragraph> is removed, the answer remains largely deducible using remaining information, and MITRE ATT&CK KB.
5 - Fully Answerable: The correct answer is directly supported by the CTI outline and is unambiguously the best choice. Even if the <masked_tactic_paragraph> is removed, the answer remains easily deducible based on the remaining CTI outline and MITRE ATT&CK KB.
