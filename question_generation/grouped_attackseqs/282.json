        "Initial Access": "The CTI report from December 7, 2022, by Phil Stokes, highlights several Initial Access techniques used by malware targeting macOS in 2022. Notably, Alchimist, a cross-platform attack framework, provides a backdoor onto target systems by binding a shell to a port for remote access. ChromeLoader, also known as ChromeBack or Choziosi Loader, spreads through malverts and malspam, using a DMG containing a shell script to install a Chrome browser extension capable of stealing information and serving adware. CloudMensis spyware uses public cloud storage services for C2 communication and exploits CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions. CrateDepression, a supply chain attack on the Rust development community, drops Poseidon payloads via a malicious crate named 'rustdecimal'. DazzleSpy, a sophisticated malware, uses advanced techniques for evasion and persistence, masquerading as an Apple launch service. Gimmick, related to macOS.Macma, is a backdoor used by an APT targeting activists in Hong Kong, leveraging cloud hosting services for C2. Lazarus Group's Operation In(ter)ception targets Coinbase and Crypto.com users with lures of job offers and drops multi-stage macOS malware. oRAT, distributed via a Disk Image masquerading as Bitget Apps, delivers a payload with backdoor functionality. Pymafka, a malicious Python package, infects users through typosquatting and downloads a Mach-O binary called 'MacOs'. Lastly, a VPN Trojan drops two malicious binaries, 'softwareupdated' and 'covid', using a script executed from a DMG.",
        "Persistence": "The CTI report identifies several Persistence techniques used by macOS malware in 2022. Alchimist malware attempts to establish a persistent backdoor on the target system. ChromeLoader uses a Bash script to install a persistent Chrome browser extension. CloudMensis spyware employs a downloader and implant for persistent operations. CrateDepression malware checks for the GITLAB_CI environment variable for Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines and retrieves a second-stage payload for persistence. DazzleSpy installs a LaunchAgent for persistence that masquerades as an Apple launch service. Gimmick uses similar persistence agent labels as macOS.Macma. Operation In(ter)ception installs a LaunchAgent for persistence in the user's local folder. oRAT delivers a payload to the /tmp directory for persistence. The VPN Trojan executes a script which drops a persistence agent with the filename com.apple.softwareupdate.plist.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The CTI report from December 7, 2022, by Phil Stokes, details Defense Evasion techniques used by macOS malware in 2022. Alchimist contains a privilege escalation exploit for CVE-2021-4034, although this tool is rarely found on Macs. ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image. CloudMensis exploits CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions. DazzleSpy uses advanced techniques to evade detection and maintain a foothold on infected machines. Gimmick and Macma share indicator overlaps, suggesting evasion tactics. Operation In(ter)ception uses lures and masquerades as legitimate processes for evasion. The VPN Trojan has superficial similarities to DazzleSpy, indicating possible evasion techniques.",
        "Command and Control": "The CTI report from December 7, 2022, by Phil Stokes, mentions Command and Control techniques used by macOS malware in 2022. Alchimist uses a web interface for controlling the implanted malware and generating payloads. ChromeLoader installs a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic and communicate with the attacker's C2. CloudMensis uses public cloud storage services for C2 communication. Gimmick takes advantage of cloud hosting services like Google Drive for its C2 communications. Operation In(ter)ception's malware serves as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2. oRAT includes a custom package with primary backdoor functionality for C2 communication. The VPN Trojan reaches out to a C2 for further tasking.",
        "Others": "The CTI report from December 7, 2022, by Phil Stokes, also mentions other malware discoveries in 2022 that do not fall under the specific tactics categories but are still significant. SysJoker is a backdoor written in Objective-C with variants for Windows, Linux, and macOS, distributed via an executable named types-config.ts. XCSSET malware saw a new variant, and a Mac version of a trojanized Chinese chat application called Mimi, attributed to IronTiger APT group, was reported. Adware infections from Pirrit, Bundlore, and Adload continue to target users with changing techniques. SentinelOne's Singularity platform defends against these threats, and SentinelLabs has published several ebooks to help understand and mitigate risks associated with macOS malware."
