        "Initial Access": "On February 11, 2016, two malicious emails were sent minutes apart to officials at Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan from the same originating IP address (5.189.145[.]248) belonging to Contabo GmbH. Both emails carried the same attachment, a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded, encoded portable executable (PE) named svchost.exe with downloader functionality.",
        "Execution": "After successful exploitation and decoding of the embedded payload, a family of malware referred to as MSIL/Crimson is executed on the victim's machine. The first stage is a downloader whose purpose is to download the more fully featured RAT component. The MSIL/Crimson downloader attempts to download the full RAT from 213.136.87[.]122:10001.",
        "Command and Control": "The MSIL/Crimson malware utilizes a custom TCP protocol for communicating with its command and control (C&C) servers. Some of its modules, which lack C&C capability, rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.",
        "Others": "Proofpoint researchers uncovered an advanced persistent threat (APT) against Indian diplomatic and military resources, which they have dubbed 'Operation Transparent Tribe.' The investigation began with malicious emails and uncovered connections to watering hole sites designed to drop a remote access Trojan (RAT) with data exfiltration functions. The campaigns and attacks appear related by common indicators of compromise (IOCs), vectors, payloads, and language. The exact nature and attribution of this APT remain under investigation. The MSIL/Crimson malware family is modular, with additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module often utilized for functions such as keylogging and browser credential theft. Infections typically occur in stages, with the first stage being a downloader component. Crimson-infected victims may be spied on via invasive methods such as through their webcam, stealing email from Outlook, and recording their screen. Some variants support at least 40 individual commands. The technical analysis section provides a full description and analysis of the MSIL/Crimson malware family."
