        "Initial Access": "In early May, Unit 42 discovered an attack campaign against at least one defense company in Russia and one unidentified organization in South Korea delivering a variant of Bisonal malware. The adversary behind these attacks lured the targets into launching the Microsoft Windows executable malware by masquerading it as a PDF file (using a fake PDF icon) and reusing publicly available data for the decoy PDF file's contents. The spear-phishing email sent to the target organization was spoofed to look like it was sent from Rostec, a Russian state corporation. The email included project details aimed at improving the housing conditions of defense industry workers. The malicious executable attachment, once opened, dropped the main payload on the victim machine and displayed a decoy file to the victim, which matched an article published on Rostec's website on January 30, 2018.",
        "Persistence": "The dropper executable file in the Russian attack hides the encrypted Bisonal DLL file and non-malicious decoy file at the end of its body. Once executed, the dropper decrypts the data blob using the RC4 cipher with the key, \"34123412\", saves them in the path shown below and executes them. The dropper then creates the following registry entry to execute the Bisonal sample when the computer reboots: HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\"vert\" = \"rundll32.exe c:\\windows\\temp\\pvcu.dll , Qszdez\"",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Bisonal malware in the Russian attack used a different cipher for C2 communication than other publicly documented samples. It employs the RC4 cipher with the key \"78563412\" for encrypting C2 address strings. The malware variant communicates with one of the following hard-coded C2 addresses by using the HTTP POST method on TCP port 443: kted56erhg.dynssl[.]com and euiro8966.organiccrap[.]com, both resolving to the same IP address, 116.193.155[.]38. The initial HTTP POST request to the C2 server contains static strings \"ks8d\" and \"akspbu.txt\", and the IP address of the compromised machine. The User Agent request header is incomplete, which can be a good indicator in network logs for a possible Bisonal infection.",
        "Command and Control": "The Bisonal variant used in the latest attack communicates with C2 addresses using the HTTP POST method. When this Bisonal variant communicates with its C2, the malware sends an HTTP POST request with static strings and the IP address of the compromised machine. The malware sends hardcoded DWORD values (0x10000 and 0x3E7) just for the initial connection and receives updated values from the C2 and uses them for further communication. All communications between this Bisonal variant and C2 are encrypted by the RC4 cipher with the static key \"78563412\". The backdoor always sends identical eight bytes of data (81b2a8977ea31b91) to the C2 first. The C2 replies with a session id number and backdoor command, which is consistent throughout the C2 communication. The malware then processes the given command on the compromised system and sends the result back to C2 with the session id number and the backdoor command number. The C2 replies with that same session id number. The backdoor waits five seconds and restarts communication with the C2 with the same session id number."
