        "Initial Access": "Prevailion's Tailored Intelligence Team has detected two new criminal campaigns targeting the global financial industry with the EVILNUM malware, which began with a victim being enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider. The link led to a compressed folder containing trojanized files disguised as typical business interactions, part of 'Know Your Customer' banking procedures. These files used images of credit cards, driver's licenses, passports, and utility bills as decoys while executing a headless Javascript agent.",
        "Execution": "The EVILNUM malware, once executed, downloads a compressed folder with trojanized files that masquerade as PDFs and JPEGs. These files, when opened, display decoy images while running a script in the background. The script, written in Phantom for Windows OS, includes a function named 'DeleteLeftovers' to remove attack artifacts. The agent can upload and download files, run commands, steal cookies, access protected data, and is designed to persist through reboots by adding a registry key.",
        "Persistence": "The EVILNUM agent ensures persistence through reboots by adding a registry key. The registry key location is modified based on the antivirus product detected on the host machine. If BitDefender or Avast is detected, the registry key is created at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\. Otherwise, it is created at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows. The key runs a shortcut file that maps to the core agent script.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The EVILNUM malware uses various techniques to evade detection, including timestomping, modifying registry keys, and using hidden windows. It also includes logic to adapt its actions based on the antivirus products detected on the host machine. The malware removes artifacts of its presence and uses a one-way communication method to obtain the C2 address, making it elusive.",
        "Credential Access": "The EVILNUM agent has the capability to steal web session cookies, allowing it to access other protected data on the infected machine.",
        "Collection": "The agent collects data from the local system and stages it for exfiltration. It is capable of retrieving subsequent payloads, indicating it likely serves as a first stage agent.",
        "Command and Control": "The agent communicates with a C2 server by sending a GET request to check.php and registers with the C2 to obtain a unique identifier. It periodically checks web pages every 50 hours for one-way communications containing the C2 node address. The C2 responds with tasks for the agent to execute.",
        "Exfiltration": "The agent exfiltrates data over the command and control channel, including uploading harvested cookies and downloading files from the C2.",
        "Others": "Prevailion has shared findings with Cyber Threat Alliance members to deploy protections and disrupt malicious cyber actors. Recommendations include disabling Microsoft shortcut files on high-risk machines, segmenting them within the network, and monitoring network logs for abnormal connections to IP addresses associated with virtual private servers."
