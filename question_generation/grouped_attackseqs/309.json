    "rewrite": {
        "Initial Access": "In September 2021, the Trend Micro Managed XDR (MDR) team detected suspicious activity related to a PurpleFox operator. The initial access was achieved through PowerShell commands that downloaded malicious payloads from URLs hosted on compromised servers, which are part of the PurpleFox botnet. The servers, mostly located in China, served as the infrastructure for the initial foothold within the network.",
        "Execution": "The execution phase involved PowerShell commands that initiated the download of a malicious payload, which included a script targeting 64-bit systems. The script checked the Windows version and applied hotfixes for vulnerabilities it targeted, such as CVE-2020-1054, CVE-2019-0808, CVE-2019-1458, and CVE-2021-1732. It then used the PowerSploit module to reflectively load an exploit bundle binary with the target vulnerability and an MSI command as arguments. As a failover, it used the Tater module to launch the MSI command, aiming to install the MSI package as an admin without user interaction.",
        "Persistence": "The MSI package installed by PurpleFox ensured persistence by removing old PurpleFox installations from the registry and installing components of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory. It modified registry values under 'HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager' to allow for file rename operations upon system restart, effectively replacing sens.dll with the malware to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).",
        "Defense Evasion": "PurpleFox's defense evasion tactics included the use of an MSI package that removed registry keys of old PurpleFox installations and installed a rootkit driver to hide its files, registry keys, and processes. The malware copied itself to another file, restored the original sens.dll file, and then loaded the driver to conceal its presence. Additionally, a .vbs script was executed to create a Windows firewall rule to block incoming connections on ports 135, 139, and 445.",
        "Command and Control": "The new .NET backdoor, named FoxSocket, leveraged WebSockets to establish a robust and secure command-and-control (C&C) channel with its servers. The backdoor maintained an open WebSocket connection by sending keepalive messages and exchanged bidirectional messages to negotiate a session encryption key. The C&C infrastructure included several active servers and domains, with the main domain advb9fyxlf2v[.]com used for load balancing across multiple active servers.",
        "Others": "The Trend Micro Vision One platform flagged suspicious PowerShell commands that retrieved the FoxSocket backdoor. The backdoor utilized WebSocket communication for a bidirectional channel between the infected client and the server, providing a covert alternative to HTTP traffic. The backdoor's capabilities included key negotiations, machine fingerprinting, and the ability to execute various commands from the server. The Trend Micro Managed XDR service offers expert threat monitoring and analysis, enhanced by AI and global threat intelligence. All indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to this attack are documented separately."
