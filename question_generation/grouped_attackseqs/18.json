    "tactic_label": true,
    "rewrite": {
        "Initial Access": "The campaign initiated with a deceptive email containing an RTF file attachment. The email subjects were crafted to entice the recipient to open the attachment, with themes such as lawsuits for workplace violence or notifications of bank account blocks. The RTF file included a link to a file-sharing service hosting a document with macros designed to download and execute a RAT.",
        "Execution": "The execution phase involved the use of macros within MHTML format documents to download and execute a RAT. The documents, which appeared between 2017 and 2019, prompted users to enable macros, which would then download and execute a RAT such as Imminent Monitor RAT, LuminosityLink RAT, NetWire RAT, NjRAT, or Warzone RAT.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers used YOPmail, a disposable email service, for command and control (C&C) communications. The malware, identified as a customized version of Proyecto RAT, would connect to a YOPmail mailbox, read an email message, and extract the C&C server URL from the email subject.",
        "Command and Control": "The C&C infrastructure utilized YOPmail for communication. The malware connected to a specific mailbox to receive C&C server URLs. The attackers also used compromised mail servers in South America and dynamic domain names linked to the C&C servers to send emails and control victims.",
        "Others": "The campaign targeted financial institutions and governmental organizations in South America, particularly Colombia. The attackers used open or compromised mail servers in South America and connected to these servers from IP addresses linked to dynamic domain names used by the delivered payloads. The main payload was usually Imminent Monitor RAT, with other RATs observed in different instances. The second stage payload, Proyecto RAT, featured a C&C URL address acquired from YOPmail. The campaign appears to be the work of a group involved in business email compromise (BEC) or cybercrime, rather than an advanced persistent threat (APT). The targeted regions and industries varied, with government entities, healthcare, financial, and agro-industry sectors being prevalent. The campaign's techniques and procedures, as well as indicators of compromise (IoCs), are detailed in an appendix provided by Trend Micro."
