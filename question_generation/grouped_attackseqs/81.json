        "Initial Access": "The adversary obtained SSH access to the target system, a large public research institution in the United States, and used the GNU utility wget to fetch malware samples from the IP address 175.45.250.xxx. The malware binary downloaded had a date string in its naming convention that matched the day it was downloaded, suggesting it was compiled on that day, indicating active developer involvement.",
        "Execution": "Upon execution, the custom loader loads the Derusbi malware into memory. Derusbi then drops the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk, loads it into the kernel, and deletes it from disk to avoid detection. The client uses Turbo to hide relevant user space processes.",
        "Persistence": "The Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) provides persistence by hiding processes, making detection of the attacker's malicious applications more difficult when running on the victim's system.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Derusbi malware and Turbo kernel module employ cloaking and anti-analysis techniques. The Turbo LKM is loaded into kernel space to modify the system's global call table, particularly pertaining to process IDs (PIDs), allowing user space applications to hide and unhide any process. Additionally, the LKM disables the CPU's control register zero's (CR0) write protection to modify the system call table.",
        "Discovery": "The Derusbi malware gathers information about the victim host, including the local host name, GCC version, and system information, which is transferred back to the command and control infrastructure via network beacons.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware binds to a raw socket on a random source port between 31800 and 31900 and beacons to the preconfigured destination port 443. The traffic is not SSL/TLS encrypted. A backup communication method with HTTP beacon is used, with content obfuscated using variable 4-byte XOR keys. The C2 interactions include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp and responses from the server."
