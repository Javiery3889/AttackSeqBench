        "Initial Access": "The Israel-based threat group employs a two-stage attack process, with the first stage involving initial email correspondence. They commonly impersonate the CEO of the targeted organization, setting the stage for the attack by claiming the organization is working through the confidential acquisition of another company and requesting assistance with an initial payment. The group uses various tactics to make the emails appear legitimate, such as spoofing the CEO's email address using the real domain if no effective DMARC policy is in place, or updating the sending display name to include the CEO's email address in the display name. The emails are primarily written in English, but some campaigns have been translated into Spanish, French, Italian, and Japanese to fit in with the usual communications of the targeted employee.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The threat group employs defense evasion tactics by stressing confidentiality in their communications, aiming to prevent the targeted employee from validating the legitimacy of the project with their manager or colleagues. They also use real domains to make emails appear as if they are coming directly from the impersonated CEO, either by spoofing the CEO's email address or using an extended spoofed display name. Additionally, the group has been hesitant to use mule accounts in the United States or the United Kingdom, likely indicating that they don't have a good mule network there.",
        "Others": "The report details the activities of a sophisticated Israel-based threat group responsible for over 350 BEC campaigns since February 2021. The group targets multinational corporations with annual revenues averaging over $10 billion, with employees in at least 61 different countries across six continents. The campaigns follow a cyclical pattern, with 80% of attacks occurring during three periods throughout the year. The group does not target specific industries and prefers larger enterprises. The average amount requested in an attack is $712,000. The group uses real attorneys' identities, often from KPMG, to coordinate payments. The secondary personas referenced are real M&A attorneys based in the UK. The group's unique approach includes requesting large sums of money and transitioning conversations to voice calls via WhatsApp to expedite the process and reduce the paper trail. The report concludes with recommendations for protecting organizations from BEC attacks, emphasizing the need for security solutions that use behavioral AI to understand identity, context, and content."
