        "Initial Access": "The CTI report details the initial access methods used by Russian-speaking cybercriminals, which include spear-phishing and phishing mass-mailing with malicious attachments or web-links. Infection can also occur through compromised websites that redirect users to exploit sites, leading to automatic malware downloads (drive-by downloads).",
        "Execution": "The report describes the execution phase where cybercriminals download programs for remote, hidden administration onto compromised computers to gain system administrators' credentials. They often use legal remote management tools known to many users.",
        "Defense Evasion": "To evade defenses, cybercriminals set up malware within the infrastructure software of the attacked organization, enabling easy access to the internal corporate network from outside. They also ensure that internal sites of compromised organizations have the malware reinstalled when the organization's security software deletes the previous version.",
        "Discovery": "In the discovery phase, cybercriminals use remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore the financial systems of the targeted organization.",
        "Impact": "The impact of Russian-speaking cybercriminals' activities includes multi-million dollar losses for attacked organizations. The final stage of their attacks involves transferring money from the organization's accounts to mule projects or withdrawing money directly at ATMs.",
        "Others": "The CTI report provides an overview of the Russian-speaking cybercriminal market, including the types of crimes committed, the structure of criminal groups, and the roles within these groups. It also discusses the challenges in combating financial cybercrime, such as inadequate legislation and lack of international cooperation. Kaspersky Lab's efforts in investigating and responding to cyber incidents are highlighted, emphasizing the need for global collaboration to address the threat."
