        "Initial Access": "The CTI report from Securelist, authored by AMR and GReAT, details an attack leveraging a zero-day exploit, CVE-2019-13720, in Google Chrome. The exploit was delivered through a waterhole-style injection on a Korean-language news portal, where a malicious JavaScript code was inserted into the main page to redirect victims to the exploit landing page. The attack, named Operation WizardOpium, involved a script that checked the victim's system for compatibility, specifically targeting 64-bit Windows systems and Chrome versions 65 or newer.",
        "Execution": "The exploit, CVE-2019-13720, used in Operation WizardOpium, involved a race condition bug between two threads in Google Chrome, leading to a Use-After-Free (UaF) condition that could result in code execution. The attackers attempted to trigger UaF to perform an information leak and create a deterministic heap layout, utilizing heap spraying techniques to reuse a freed pointer. This allowed the attackers to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive, craft a special object, and execute embedded shellcode payload.",
        "Persistence": "For persistence, the malware installed tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler after the final payload was downloaded as an encrypted binary (worst.jpg), decrypted by the shellcode, and dropped as updata.exe to disk.",
        "Command and Control": "The main module of the malware, msdisp64.exe, was designed to download the next stage from a hardcoded command and control (C2) server set. The next stages were located on the C2 server in folders with the victim computer names, indicating that the threat actors had information about which machines were infected and placed the next stage modules in specific folders on the C2 server.",
        "Others": "The CTI report includes technical details such as the use of AJAX requests to download exploit code chunks, the use of RC4 for decryption, and the obfuscation of the browser exploit script. The report also mentions the use of BigInt for 64-bit arithmetic in JavaScript and the presence of debugging code left in the production code. Additionally, the report provides MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the files involved in the attack, as well as the domain names used by the attackers."
