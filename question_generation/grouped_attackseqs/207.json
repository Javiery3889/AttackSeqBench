        "Reconnaissance": "FireEye has been tracking a group named FIN4, which targets individuals with access to confidential information about merger and acquisition (M&A) deals and major market-moving announcements, especially in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. FIN4 focuses on individuals such as top executives, legal counsel, consultants, and researchers. They use spearphishing emails written by native English speakers familiar with investment terminology and the inner workings of public companies to capture usernames and passwords, allowing them to view private email correspondence.",
        "Resource Development": "FIN4 organizes their targets using over 70 unique 'campaign codes' to label the origin of stolen credentials. These codes are transmitted to FIN4's command and control (C2) servers along with the stolen credentials. Examples of campaign codes include 'CEO_CFO_COO_CORPDEV', 'SCIENTISTS_AND_RESEARCH', and specific company names.",
        "Initial Access": "FIN4 employs spearphishing emails to gain initial access to their targets' information. They embed VBA macros into legitimate documents that prompt users for their Outlook credentials, which are then sent to a server controlled by the group. FIN4 also uses fake Outlook Web App (OWA) login pages to capture credentials.",
        "Defense Evasion": "FIN4 has been observed creating rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts that automatically delete any emails containing words like 'hacked', 'phish', 'malware', etc. This likely prevents compromised victims from receiving replies that their email account may be compromised, buying FIN4 extra time before detection.",
        "Credential Access": "FIN4's primary method of credential access involves spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros in legitimate documents, which prompt users to enter their Outlook credentials. These credentials are then transmitted to FIN4's C2 servers. They also use fake OWA login pages to capture user credentials.",
        "Command and Control": "FIN4 uses C2 servers to collect stolen credentials from their phishing campaigns. They have used domains such as junomaat81[.]us and lifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com for their C2 infrastructure. The group also relies on Tor for anonymous communication and has specific user agents that can be identified in network logs.",
        "Others": "FIN4 has been active since at least mid-2013 and continues to compromise new victims. They have targeted over 100 organizations, with approximately two-thirds being healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. The group uses their access to insider information to potentially benefit from stock price movements. FIN4's activities suggest a sustained effort to gain advance access to market-moving information, setting them apart due to the scale of their operations and their focus on key individuals' emails."
