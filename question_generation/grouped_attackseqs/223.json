        "Initial Access": "On April 14-15, 2021, Kaspersky detected a wave of highly targeted attacks against multiple companies, which were conducted through the Chrome browser. The attackers exploited a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits. Although the exploit used for remote code execution (RCE) in Chrome was not retrieved, an elevation of privilege (EoP) exploit was analyzed, which was used to escape the sandbox and obtain system privileges.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "The attackers utilized an elevation of privilege exploit fine-tuned against the latest builds of Windows 10, exploiting two distinct vulnerabilities in the Windows OS kernel. These vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956, were reported to Microsoft on April 20, 2021, and patched on June 8, 2021. CVE-2021-31955 is an information disclosure vulnerability in ntoskrnl.exe related to the SuperFetch feature, while CVE-2021-31956 is a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs.sys. The exploit used CVE-2021-31955 to obtain kernel addresses and CVE-2021-31956 along with Windows Notification Facility (WNF) to create arbitrary memory read and write primitives. The exploit also used a \"PreviousMode\" technique to inject malware into the system process.",
        "Command and Control": "The attack chain included four additional malware modules: Stager, Dropper, Service, and Remote shell. The Stager module notified of successful exploitation, downloaded, and executed a malware Dropper module from a remote server. The Dropper installed two executables pretending to be legitimate Windows files, with one registered as a service and used as a launcher for the Remote shell, which acted as the main payload. The Remote shell module communicated with a C&C server and could download/upload files, create processes, sleep, and delete itself from the compromised machine.",
        "Others": "Kaspersky products detected the attacks using the Behavioral Detection Engine and the Exploit Prevention component. The threat actor behind these attacks is referred to as PuzzleMaker. Kaspersky thanked Microsoft for their prompt analysis and patches. The malware modules are detected with the verdicts PDM:Exploit.Win32.Generic, PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic, and UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic. The hashes for the executables involved in the attack are provided for %SYSTEM%\\WmiPrvMon.exe and %SYSTEM%\\wmimon.dll."
