        "Persistence": "The report details the discovery of a rootkit named Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a within HP iLO firmware. This rootkit is designed to maintain persistence by manipulating the iLO firmware upgrade routine, simulating version changes while preventing actual updates. The malware achieves persistence by disabling signature validation in both the operating system kernel and bootloader, allowing the infected firmware to load without issues after reboots.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a evades detection by simulating firmware updates and displaying fake version information in the iLO web console. It modifies the firmware update process to maintain the infected firmware and alters admin web interface modules to display invalid software version information. Additionally, it modifies server event logging modules to prevent logging of its operations.",
        "Impact": "The rootkit is capable of wiping server disks completely, with the ability to perform this action repeatedly at intervals. This destructive capability is part of the malware's impact tactics, designed to hide tracks and potentially disrupt operations by destroying data on the server's hard disks.",
        "Others": "The report emphasizes the importance of firmware security and the challenges posed by proprietary technologies like HP iLO, which lacks public tools and information for security analysis. It highlights the need for preventive security measures, such as updating firmware, changing admin passwords, isolating the iLO network, and periodically monitoring firmware status. The report also mentions the development of tools to dump iLO firmware and check for infections, which will be made available to the public."
