        "Reconnaissance": "The cybercrime group TeamTNT has been observed using a new image, pause-amd64:3.4, to conduct reconnaissance and spread malware. This image is deployed on Kubernetes clusters and uses a shell script as its entry point, which downloads a coin miner from a server located in Germany. The script then scans for open Docker API endpoints using the masscan tool and deploys the same image on exposed endpoints. Additionally, the script attempts to kill competitor images using docker rm commands.",
        "Initial Access": "TeamTNT has been known to spread their malware via exposed Docker API servers. The new access vector discovered involves the use of an open Weave Scope service, which is a visualization and monitoring framework for containerized environments. Weave Scope, when exposed to the Internet without authentication, allows attackers to run shell on the pods or nodes in the cluster, leading to compromise.",
        "Execution": "The main payload, a coin miner, is executed after being downloaded and saved on the host as /usr/sbin/docker-update. The attributes of the miner are changed to immutable, and it is executed to perform cryptocurrency mining.",
        "Discovery": "TeamTNT's script performs discovery by scanning IP ranges for open Docker API endpoints and deploys the malware to other machines. The script also uses a service called iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details.",
        "Others": "Azure Security Center (ASC) detects the attack by monitoring the behavior of the AKS management layer and the containers themselves. ASC provides protection at both the management layer, by detecting exposed sensitive services like Weave Scope, and at the node level, by detecting openly accessible Docker API services and malicious behavior such as cryptocurrency mining activity. Recommendations include using Azure Policy for Kubernetes to restrict and audit sensitive actions and deploying images from trusted registries only."
