        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report indicates that adversaries continue to use worms to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts, employing scanning tools such as masscan to increase the frequency of scanning activity and the chances of finding misconfigurations promptly. Some adversaries also use public search engines like Shodan or Censys. An example script was provided, showing how attackers configure the netblock, start IP address, log files, and the container to be executed on detected IPs. The function DOCKERGEDDON, containing masscan and zgrab, is used to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs, collect information about the host, and deploy a malicious container.",
        "Resource Development": "The report details that attackers' infrastructure was analyzed by examining inbound and outbound traffic. IPs used to disseminate and communicate with Kinsing malware were identified, likely part of a botnet linked to the Kinsing malware campaign. TeamTNT used domains like teamtnt[.]red, kaiserfranz[.]cc, and borg[.]wtf for CnC server, DNS, and IRC server, all resolving to the same IP address. Attackers also used compromised websites to store malicious files downloaded during container runtime. Additionally, attackers utilized open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities and exploit them.",
        "Initial Access": "Attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet, allowing all incoming traffic access. They also built files on the host from base64. Adversaries created public registry accounts that mimic popular software or packages to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images, such as Tesnorflow, a typo-squatting of Tensorflow. A massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI was reported, where crypto miners were executed during the auto-build of an image process, targeting supply-chain processes.",
        "Execution": "Attackers abused command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries. They used cmd or entry point to execute commands, scripts, or binaries, including executing shell or Python scripts already on disk, using CURL or WGET UNIX commands to download scripts or binaries from a remote source, and hiding encoded binary in the cmd, decoding it, writing it to file, and executing it. Attackers also scheduled local jobs after mounting the host and using the cron utility.",
        "Persistence": "Adversaries used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow and gain persistency by giving priority to their malicious code, as seen in a rootkit loaded in the container. They also created new user accounts with RSA keys to open backdoors for full control of the host.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "Attackers used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host by creating a writable hostPath volume. They also used chroot to run processes outside the container and save files in different locations on the host. External remote services like IRC channels were used by Tsunami malware to provide full access to an infected machine and become part of a botnet.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Adversaries removed security software to avoid detection, using techniques to detect and remove security software, such as disabling Watchdog and deleting Alibaba Aliyun Aegis cloud security software. They also used obfuscated files or information, like software packing, to avoid detection of malicious binaries. Fileless malware attacks were executed by loading malware into memory and executing it without leaving a trace on the disk.",
        "Credential Access": "Adversaries used open-source tools to collect credentials, such as the Python script punk.py, which collects usernames, SSH keys, and known hosts from a Unix system. They also created and hid users in the victim's environment to mask the presence of user accounts they created.",
        "Command and Control": "Attackers used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration. They also used legitimate external websites as C2 servers, downloading malicious code from sources like GitHub and Bitbucket. Data encoding was used to compile binary files from decoded snippets in the entry point, establishing contact with C2 servers to download shell scripts.",
        "Exfiltration": "Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials over the C2 server was observed, with adversaries looking for AWS keys and trying to exfiltrate them to their C2 servers. Access to the Instance Metadata Services (IMDS) should be limited through IAM roles and network access policies.",
        "Impact": "Cryptocurrency mining was the main objective of most attacks, with over 90% of the images executing resource hijacking. However, new objectives such as backdoors, malware deployments, and credential theft are emerging. Adversaries are also using worms to reach further victims, and over 40% of the attacks involve backdoors, indicating that attackers are looking to maximize their gain from each attack."
