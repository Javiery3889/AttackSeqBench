        "Initial Access": "The Turla APT group used a .NET/MSIL dropper to deliver the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor. The dropper, disguised as an invitation to a G20 task force meeting, was first observed in mid-July. The decoy document, potentially stolen, suggests targeting of G20 participants or those interested in the G20 Digital Economy event.",
        "Execution": "Upon execution, the MSIL dropper deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper. The JavaScript dropper installs a JS decryptor, which then decrypts and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory. The dropper, named Runer.exe, contains no obfuscation and writes the Stage1 JS and decoy PDF to %APPDATA% for execution.",
        "Persistence": "The JavaScript dropper, Scr.js, creates a scheduled task named PolicyConverter for persistence, set to run every 10 minutes. This task executes the JS backdoor decryptor, appidpolicyconverter.js, which contains the KopiLuwak backdoor code.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The KopiLuwak MSIL dropper lacks obfuscation or anti-analysis features. The JavaScript dropper Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and sets up persistence without raising suspicion. The backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites, and the HTTP User-Agent is now hardcoded, differing from previous variants.",
        "Discovery": "Scr.js fingerprints the infected system by executing various commands and saving the output to a temporary file. The commands include checking for Kaspersky Lab directories and performing a traceroute to www.google.com.",
        "Command and Control": "The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests. The backdoor can receive commands from the C&C, including exfiltrating data, downloading files, and executing arbitrary commands.",
        "Exfiltration": "The updated KopiLuwak backdoor can exfiltrate files to the C&C and download files to the infected machine. It supports commands for exfiltrating content and saving provided content to the infected machine.",
        "Others": "Proofpoint researchers have not observed the attack in the wild but note the potential high impact for PCs running the .NET framework. The Turla APT group is believed to be Russian state-sponsored and has been involved in various cyber espionage activities. The researchers will continue to monitor the actor and the new tools."
