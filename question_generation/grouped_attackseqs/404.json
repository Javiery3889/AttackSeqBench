        "Initial Access": "An email with a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment was sent to Susan, a secretary at Black Gold. The PDF, which passed through all security filters, was actually an executable file disguised as a document, initiating the attack when opened.",
        "Execution": "The executable file created a folder and extracted six files, running 'stat.vbs' which in turn executed 'deca.bat'. This batch file opened a blank PDF and ran 'dcp.exe', a file encryption tool, to decrypt two files and extract the contents of 'bare.zip' into a different folder. The 'sai.vbs' script was then executed.",
        "Persistence": "The attack modified the Windows registry to ensure 'aagi.bat' ran at system start, and used legitimate applications to collect credentials, renaming them to indicate the time of collection. It also configured an application to run another batch file every hour to maintain its operations.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attack evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts without any malicious activity, avoiding behavior-based detectors. It remained undetected for almost six months.",
        "Credential Access": "Legitimate applications were used to collect credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers, saving them to text files. These credentials were then uploaded to an external FTP server controlled by the attackers.",
        "Collection": "The attack collected credentials recurrently every hour, resulting in over 80,000 text files with stolen credentials from various firms, all within the oil and gas maritime transportation sector.",
        "Command and Control": "The attack used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials to an external server, and the 'iei.bat' file was run every hour to manage the collection and transmission of the data.",
        "Exfiltration": "Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server, with the oldest files dating back to August 2013, indicating the long-term undetected nature of the attack.",
        "Others": "The attack, dubbed 'Phantom Menace', targeted companies in the oil and gas maritime transportation sector. It was linked to a scam involving fake oil deals, where stolen credentials were likely used to forge documents for fraudulent transactions. The attackers appeared to be based in Nigeria, with connections to Ikeja, known as the 'Computer Village'. Despite the evidence, victims were unwilling to report the crime, hindering police investigations. The case highlights the need for companies to perform regular audits and implement new protection strategies for network security."
