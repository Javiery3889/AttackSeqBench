        "Reconnaissance": "July to August 2011: The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains. February 2015: A second-stage implant delivered by a variant of the S-Type backdoor shortly following its initial reconnaissance compromised the investment arm of a major Japanese Automaker.",
        "Initial Access": "July to August 2011: Attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks. February 2014: A watering hole attack on a popular software reseller delivered an Internet Explorer zero-day to a number of unsuspecting targets.",
        "Persistence": "February 2014: The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.",
        "Credential Access": "July to August 2011: The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.",
        "Command and Control": "May 2015: Attack group adopts and customizes several Android backdoors to suit their purposes and uses a massive infrastructure compared to previous attacks. Initial backdoors are relatively simple, but continually forward all SMS messages and call information back to their C2 servers. All identified victims reside in Japan or South Korea. 2015: A number of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials compromise a number of Japanese companies involved in power generation, oil and natural gas, construction, finance, and transportation.",
        "Others": "March to August 2013: Attack activity greatly subsides, although several new domains that will be used later are registered. Early operations are extremely blunt, relatively unsophisticated, and readily picked up by the security industry. October 2011: Attack group attempts to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan crisis by phishing the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi's death, targeting US defense targets. June 2012: Attack campaign leverages previously used flash exploit and Internet Explorer zero-day. July & October 2015: Two new waves of attacks are launched, targeting multiple Japanese companies including a Japanese subsidiary of a South Korean electric utility and a major Japanese oil and gas company. The most likely goals are reconnaissance and long-term espionage. 2016: SPEAR believes that attacks of this nature into companies involved in Japanese critical infrastructure and resources are ongoing and likely to continue to escalate in the future."
