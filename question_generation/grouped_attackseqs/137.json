        "Initial Access": "The EyePyramid attacks targeted high-profile Italian individuals using spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. The malware was spread using social engineering tactics to trick victims into executing the attachments, which were often ZIP or 7zip archives containing the EyePyramid malware. The attackers also used executable files with extensions hidden by multiple spaces, indicating a low level of sophistication in the attack.",
        "Command and Control": "The EyePyramid malware communicated with command-and-control (C&C) servers to exfiltrate stolen data. The Italian police report identified several C&C servers and email addresses used by the malware, including eyepyramid[.]com, hostpenta[.]com, and various others. Kaspersky Lab's analysis found that the campaign was active since at least March 2014 and lasted until August 2016, with over 100 active victims identified on the server used to host the malware, all located in Italy.",
        "Exfiltration": "The EyePyramid malware exfiltrated stolen data using email addresses such as gpool@hostpenta[.]com, hanger@hostpenta[.]com, and others. The attackers targeted around 16,000 victims, with evidence suggesting that tens of gigabytes of data were stolen from compromised individuals.",
        "Others": "The EyePyramid attacks were a homebrew cyberespionage operation that affected Italy. The malware targeted politicians, bankers, freemasons, law enforcement personalities, and even Vatican Cardinals. The operation compromised a large number of victims, including high-profile individuals, resulting in the theft of significant amounts of data. The suspects, Giulio Occhionero and Francesca Maria Occhionero, were arrested on January 10, 2017. The operation had poor operational security, with the suspects using IP addresses associated with their company and discussing victims over phone calls and WhatsApp. Kaspersky Lab products detect and remove EyePyramid samples with various verdicts. A full report on EyePyramid, including technical details, is available to customers of Kaspersky APT Intelligence Services."
