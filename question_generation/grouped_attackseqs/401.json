        "Initial Access": "The CTI report indicates that attackers used email as the primary method for initial access, delivering malware in 70% of ransomware attacks on organizations. Additionally, a quarter of these attacks exploited vulnerabilities and searched for unprotected resources accessible from the Internet. The RTM APT group employed phishing emails as their main delivery method, while the attack on SolarWinds facilitated access to the networks of its customers.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Malware developers have been seeking new ways to evade security measures. For instance, the BazarBackdoor (RAT) was rewritten in Nim, and the ransomware operators of Vovalex and RobbinHood used uncommon programming languages like D and Golang. Miners such as OSAMiner, Black-T, and Pro-Ocean have features to erase traces of malicious activity. RTM APT group used packers as a service to bypass security tools, complicating the search for known signatures. However, behavioral analysis in sandboxes can detect malicious activity.",
        "Others": "The report highlights a 17% increase in cyberattacks compared to Q1 2020, with ransomware being the most frequently used malware. Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server (ProxyLogon) and Accellion FTA were popular among attackers. The targeting of virtual infrastructure and software developers, as well as cloud services, was notable. Attacks on telecom companies doubled, with a focus on obtaining data, particularly related to 5G technology. Governmental institutions remained the most frequently attacked, with malware and social engineering being the primary methods used. The report emphasizes the importance of installing security updates and protecting virtual infrastructure to mitigate cyber threats."
