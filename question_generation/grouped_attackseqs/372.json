        "Initial Access": "APT35, also known as Charming Kitten, Imperial Kitten, or Tortoiseshell, infiltrated a corporate device likely through a spear phishing email. This initial access was undetected until Darktrace's Cyber AI was deployed, which later identified the compromised device.",
        "Persistence": "The infected device exhibited persistent command and control (C2) beaconing, indicating that APT35 maintained a foothold within the system, lying low and awaiting further instructions.",
        "Defense Evasion": "APT35 managed to evade detection by conducting minimal activity ('lying low') and avoiding triggering security alerts. The group's presence went unnoticed by the organization's existing security measures until Darktrace's Cyber AI identified the unusual C2 traffic.",
        "Discovery": "Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected, automating the investigation process and reducing time to triage by 92%.",
        "Lateral Movement": "The internal security team verified with Darktrace that no lateral movement or data exfiltration had occurred following the C2 beaconing detection.",
        "Command and Control": "Darktrace detected APT35's C2 activity without relying on signatures or threat intelligence. The C2 destinations included known malicious domains such as cortanaservice[.]com.",
        "Others": "Max Heinemeyer, Director of Threat Hunting at Darktrace, authored the blog post detailing the discovery of APT35's activity. The post highlights the value of self-learning AI in detecting pre-existing infections and 'low and slow' attacks. Darktrace's Proactive Threat Notifications and Antigena could have autonomously enforced normal activity for the device, preventing the C2 traffic without interrupting regular business workflows."
