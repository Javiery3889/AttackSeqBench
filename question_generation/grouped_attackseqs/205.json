        "Initial Access": "The CTI report from PwC indicates that the threat actor known as Sofacy has been deploying malware through malicious websites linked in spear phishing emails. These emails also attempt to phish for web-mail credentials. The report also mentions the use of zero-day exploits, specifically CVE-2015-3043 and CVE-2015-1701, for delivering the malware.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The report suggests that despite the use of sophisticated zero-day exploits for delivery, the attackers continue to employ old variants of their malware, indicating a possible defense evasion technique where known malware is used in conjunction with new exploits to avoid detection.",
        "Command and Control": "The report lists a number of domains that are likely related to Sofacy's activities, which are typically used for phishing and/or malware command and control. These domains are suggested for review in network logs to detect potential malicious activity.",
        "Others": "The CTI report from PwC, dated 2015-04-20 and authored by threatintelligence@uk.pwc.com, provides tactical intelligence on the activities of the threat actor Sofacy. The report includes references to recent reports by Trend Micro and FireEye, which relate to similar activities by Sofacy. PwC also offers to provide a TLP-GREEN version of the report with additional indicators for further distribution according to US-CERT's definition for TLP. The report includes an appendix with a redacted list of domains associated with Sofacy, which are used for phishing and malware command and control. The report emphasizes the importance of reviewing network logs for these domains to aid in detecting Sofacy's activities."
