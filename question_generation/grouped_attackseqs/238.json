        "Initial Access": "We have observed multiple malware attacks against Israeli and Palestinian targets, likely performed by the same attacker. The attacks utilized spear phishing emails with malicious attachments, such as the one purporting to come from IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz. The malware files, often digitally signed to appear legitimate, were typically contained in self-extracting RAR files with misleading names that disguised their executable nature.",
        "Execution": "The malware identified in the attacks includes the XtremeRat backdoor trojan, which is commercially available and has been used in various attacks over the years. This malware was found in executable files disguised as documents, such as 'IDF strikes militants in Gaza Strip following rocket barrage.doc.scr', and was signed with a digital certificate that appeared to be from Microsoft, although it was actually untrusted and faked.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers utilized digital signatures to make the malware appear legitimate, even though the certificates were untrusted and faked. This tactic was used to evade defenses and increase the likelihood of the malware being executed by the target.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware communicated with command-and-control (C&C) structures hosted on various DynDNS services, with IP addresses resolving to hosting services in the US. The C&C infrastructure was shared among the malware samples, indicating a coordinated attack. The IP addresses used for C&C servers changed regularly, with some remaining static for longer periods.",
        "Others": "The attacks have been ongoing for at least a year, initially focusing on Palestinian targets before shifting to Israeli targets. The purpose of the attacks is assumed to be espionage/surveillance. The attacker remains unknown, but the use of off-the-shelf malware suggests a lower-cost operation. The attacks likely involved email attachments containing malicious files within archives like RAR or ZIP. Document metadata from bait attachments revealed usernames associated with the creation and modification of the documents, providing clues about the attackers."
