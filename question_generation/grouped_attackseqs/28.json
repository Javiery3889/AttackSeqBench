        "Initial Access": "The CTI report by Unit 42 reveals an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide, utilizing a new malware family named TidePool. The campaign is consistent with the tactics of the threat actor known as Ke3chang, which historically targeted the Ministry of Affairs and conducted several campaigns against India. The initial access is achieved through spear phishing emails that exploit the vulnerability CVE-2015-2545, first made public in September 2015. The emails contain weaponized documents that trigger the vulnerability when opened in Microsoft Word.",
        "Execution": "The CTI report details that the TidePool malware, once executed, allows the attacker to perform various actions such as reading, writing, and deleting files and folders, as well as running commands over named pipes. It gathers information about the victim's computer, encodes it in base64, and sends it to the Command and Control (C2) server via HTTP. This behavior matches the capabilities of the BS2005 malware family used by Ke3chang.",
        "Persistence": "TidePool achieves persistence by utilizing an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry, which ensures that the malware launches on boot with the following parameters: rundll32.exe C:\\DOCUME~1\\ALLUSE~1\\IEHelper\\mshtml.dll,,IEHelper",
        "Defense Evasion": "The report indicates that both TidePool and the BS2005 malware family, used by Ke3chang, focus on modifying the registry setting 'Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ZoneMap\\IEHarden' to 0. This disables the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security configuration, which is designed to prevent the execution of scripts, ActiveX Controls, file downloads, and the Microsoft virtual machine for HTML content. This technique is common to both malware families and is used as a means of defense evasion.",
        "Command and Control": "TidePool communicates with its C2 server using HTTP as the protocol. The C2 domain identified in the report is 'goback.strangled[.]net'. The malware sends victim computer information to the C2 server, which then allows it to receive commands and behave as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).",
        "Others": "The CTI report by Unit 42 uncovers the evolution of the Ke3chang actor's malware arsenal, with TidePool being the latest iteration. The report provides a detailed analysis of the code reuse and behavioral similarities between TidePool and previous malware used by Ke3chang, such as BS2005. The targeting of Indian embassies aligns with Ke3chang's historical focus, and the use of a Chinese language encoding in the binaries suggests the actor's system likely runs an operating system with Chinese as the default display language. The report also includes indicators of compromise (IOCs) with hashes and compile dates of various samples linked to Ke3chang and TidePool."
