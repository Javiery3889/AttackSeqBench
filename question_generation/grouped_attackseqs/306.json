        "Execution": "The CTI report details the execution of malicious software by the Lazarus group during the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB) heist. The attackers deployed a loader/spreader malware, identified as Sample #2, which established persistence via a registry key and attempted to disable specific antivirus processes. Additionally, the report mentions the use of a 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file, which was decrypted and executed as a TMP file. The Lazarus group also utilized backdoor malware, Samples #4 and #6, packed with Themida and designed to communicate with command and control servers. The backdoor executed remote commands, granting attackers full control over compromised systems.",
        "Persistence": "The CTI report indicates that the Lazarus group established persistence on the FEIB network by placing a copy of the loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) in the C:\\Windows\\Temp directory and setting a registry key for automatic execution. The malware also attempted to spread itself to other devices on the network using hardcoded user accounts and passwords related to FEIB.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Lazarus group employed defense evasion tactics by attempting to kill specific antivirus processes using the taskkill command line tool. They also used a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image, which was then decrypted and executed. Additionally, the backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) was packed with Themida to evade analysis and detection.",
        "Lateral Movement": "The Lazarus group attempted lateral movement within the FEIB network by copying the loader/spreader malware to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts. The malware iterated through a list of 5357 hardcoded IP addresses, targeting active and responding devices, and established connections to SMB shares using the provided credentials.",
        "Command and Control": "The Lazarus group's backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) communicated with remote command and control servers. The backdoor expected a command line parameter specifying the C&C address and port number, and it polled the remote C&C for tasks to execute, maintaining a communication session and executing remote commands as directed.",
        "Impact": "The Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware as a potential distraction during the heist. The ransomware deleted Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, and encrypted files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm, leaving ransom notes in each encrypted directory. This action likely aimed to disrupt the bank's operations and delay response to the heist.",
        "Others": "The CTI report provides background on the FEIB heist, including the use of SWIFT network to perform unauthorized transfers. It also mentions the arrest of individuals in Sri Lanka related to cashing out transferred funds. The report concludes with insights into the Lazarus group's activities and recommendations for network hardening and monitoring to prevent similar attacks."
