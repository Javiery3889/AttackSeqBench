        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report by Bryan Lee and Josh Grunzweig from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42, dated November 18, 2015, indicates that the Dark Seoul attackers, also known as Operation Troy, have resurfaced. The attackers conducted reconnaissance by using malware to perform basic reconnaissance on the infected host and return the results to the attacker. The malware executed commands to gather system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths on the host system.",
        "Initial Access": "The report suggests that the initial access vector for the new campaign was likely a spear-phishing email. The attackers used a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable hosted by a company in the industrial control systems sector. The executable, while installing the legitimate video player software, also infected the system with malware.",
        "Execution": "The malware, named TDrop2, executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable from the system32 folder and then used process hollowing to inject malicious code into the process. This technique allowed the malware to evade detection and execute the second-stage payload.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The TDrop2 malware used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file. The C2 server replaced the first two bytes of the payload with 'DW' instead of 'MZ' to evade network security solutions. The dropper would then restore the initial bytes before executing the payload.",
        "Discovery": "The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host. This included system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware communicated with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands. The encryption used an unidentified cryptographic routine, and the data was base64 encoded with a custom alphabet. The C2 servers were compromised websites located in South Korea and Europe.",
        "Others": "The CTI report details the similarities between the new TDrop2 malware variant and the original Dark Seoul/Operation Troy toolset. The malware used a custom base64 alphabet and a distinct string decryption routine observed in previous Operation Troy samples. The report also mentions that the C2 servers used in the recent attacks were compromised websites, which may have been due to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. The report raises the possibility that the same groups responsible for the original attacks are behind this new campaign, although there is no conclusive evidence at this time."
