        "Execution": "The implant, identified as Tildeb, is a 32-bit console Windows executable named clocksvc.exe, which accepts command-line arguments and was compiled on October 3, 2000. It utilizes the MFC library, specifically mfc42.dll, for network communications and is compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ v6.0. Tildeb does not employ obfuscation techniques such as anti-disassembly, anti-debugging features, or encrypted strings. The implant can operate with various command-line arguments to establish communication with its C&C server using a hardcoded IP address and port, or alternative IP/domain and ports provided as arguments. It also has a capability to listen on a TCP socket for incoming connections and can attempt privilege elevation to inject code into a Microsoft Exchange Server process.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Tildeb lacks persistence mechanisms and is designed to clean up after itself if it does not receive data from the C&C server or encounters specific failures. It includes a cleanup thread that triggers a cleanup process under certain conditions, such as a lack of communication from the C&C server or failure to create a process. The cleanup process involves closing handles, deleting temporary files, shutting down sockets, and terminating the process.",
        "Command and Control": "Tildeb establishes network communication with its C&C server over TCP, using either ingress or egress connections. It employs the MFC Classes CAsyncSocket and CSocket for network communications and does not use SMTP despite the default port number assignment. The implant sets up a secure communication channel with the server, where all subsequent traffic is encrypted. It uses a modified SHA-1 hashing algorithm to generate pseudorandom data for establishing session keys, which are then used for XOR-encrypted communication.",
        "Others": "The implant Tildeb is associated with the moniker 'PATROLWAGON,' which is likely a reference to an unknown exploitation framework or tool. Tildeb's delivery method is not specified, but it may be distributed via lateral movement or other exploitation frameworks with RCE modules targeting Windows NT. The implant's hardcoded IP address contains a formatting error that affects its connectivity on different versions of Windows OS. Tildeb supports various control commands for malicious activities, including file deletion, file upload, directory listing, registry value modification, and code injection into Microsoft Exchange Server processes. It uses mailslots for interprocess communication and has specific routines for injecting code into Exchange Server processes. The implant attempts to exploit an unknown privilege escalation vulnerability in the win32k.sys driver on systems with specific locale settings."
