        "Initial Access": "Symantec has identified that the Duke group, using Trojan.Cozer (aka Cozyduke), initiated their campaign as early as March 2014, targeting a private research institute in Washington, D.C. The group employed tactics such as sending 'Office Monkeys'- and 'eFax'-themed emails containing a Cozyduke payload to compromise high-profile government networks. These emails were used as a smokescreen to hide the true intent of the attacks.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Seaduke, a low-profile information-stealing Trojan, is capable of hiding behind multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation. It is designed to quietly steal and exfiltrate sensitive information such as emails from the victim's computer. Seaduke has a highly configurable framework, with hundreds of different configurations found on compromised networks. The malware's communication protocol employs many layers of encryption and obfuscation, using over 200 compromised web servers for command and control.",
        "Credential Access": "The Duke group has developed additional payloads for specific attacks, including impersonation using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks (Mimikatz PowerShell) and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server using compromised credentials.",
        "Collection": "The Duke group's Seaduke payload allows attackers to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update bot configuration, upload files, download files, and securely delete the malware from the system using a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.",
        "Command and Control": "Seaduke operates by securely communicating with the command-and-control (C&C) server over HTTP/HTTPS beneath layers of encoding (Base64) and encryption (RC4, AES). The attackers can control Seaduke in a similar fashion to Cozyduke, with the Seaduke control infrastructure being essentially distinct, allowing for the possibility of sub-teams concurrently exploiting the target network.",
        "Exfiltration": "The Duke group utilizes Seaduke to archive sensitive information and exfiltrate data via legitimate cloud services, as well as to perform secure file deletion.",
        "Others": "The Duke group, responsible for the Seaduke malware, has been compromising governmental and diplomatic organizations since at least 2010. The group has a range of malware tools known as the Dukes, including Cozyduke, Miniduke, and Cosmicduke. They have mounted an extended campaign targeting high-profile networks and have sophisticated operators with fine-tuned computer network exploitation skills. The group's operational capability has reached a new level, and despite drawing significant attention, they continue to operate and are expected to reappear with potentially reworked or new tools."
