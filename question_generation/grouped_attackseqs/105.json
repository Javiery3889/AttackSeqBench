        "Initial Access": "The Emotet trojan, which resurfaced in July, is spread via phishing emails and has downloader functionality, enabling it to deliver other malware. Emotet initially spread Trickbot spyware, which after collecting information opened up access to Ryuk and Conti ransomware. Later, attackers installed the QakBot (QBot) banking trojan on victim computers. Emotet sends more than 500,000 emails daily on weekdays, excluding weekends, and uses message threads on the infected computer for spreading.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Attackers are getting creative about hiding their tracks to maintain stealth, even against sandboxes. One incident involved a special malicious plugin (PhysXPluginMfx) for Autodesk 3ds Max, which remained inactive if Task Manager or Process Monitor was running. Zeppelin ransomware returned with a new downloader that evades dynamic analysis in a sandbox by stopping malicious activity for 26 seconds after the downloader performs its work.",
        "Impact": "Ransomware attacks have increased, with over half of all malware attacks involving ransomware. Notable ransomware families include Netwalker, REvil, Maze, DoppelPaymer, and RansomEXX. Attackers often steal data before encrypting the victim's copy and demand ransoms for decryption and non-disclosure. Manufacturing and industry, as well as healthcare, were particularly targeted. In healthcare, Ryuk ransomware attacked Universal Health Services, disrupting patient care. REvil attacked Valley Health hospitals, stealing and publishing patient medical data. SunCrypt ransomware attacked University Hospital New Jersey, stealing and publishing patient records.",
        "Others": "The number of cyberattacks grew by 2.7% in Q3 2020 compared to Q2, and by 54% compared to Q3 2019. Ransomware is increasingly prevalent, with 51% of malware attacks using ransomware in Q3. Manufacturing and industrial companies, as well as healthcare institutions, are primary targets. The percentage of social engineering attacks using COVID-19 as a lure fell from 16% in Q2 to 4% in Q3. Hacking as an attack method on companies grew by 12 percentage points to 30%, likely due to the pandemic and the transition to working from home. Vulnerabilities in services on the perimeter of corporate systems are being actively exploited. To protect from cyberattacks, it is recommended to follow guidelines for personal and corporate cybersecurity, including a well-organized vulnerability management process, security solutions like WAF, traffic analysis, SIEM systems, and verifying email attachments in a sandbox."
