        "Initial Access": "The Proofpoint researchers observed a China-based attack group targeting military and aerospace interests in Russia and Belarus using a new downloader known as ZeroT to install the PlugX remote access Trojan (RAT). The initial dropper delivered in spear-phishing emails was a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (.chm) file named 20160621.chm, which dropped the first known sample of ZeroT. The CHM file contained an HTM file and an executable file named svchost.exe. Opening the CHM file resulted in running the executable. Attackers also continued to send spear-phishing emails with Microsoft Word attachments utilizing CVE-2012-0158 to exploit the client. These documents were built with MNKit. Additionally, RAR archives and RAR SFX (self-extracting executables) of ZeroT were found, several referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).",
        "Command and Control": "ZeroT communicates with its command and control (C&C) over HTTP using a fake User-Agent. It first beacons to index.php expecting an RC4-encrypted response using a static key. ZeroT expects several URLs including a location to POST system information and a download location for any stage 2 payloads. It uses HTTP POST beacons to transmit information about the infected system to the C&C. The first beacon contains the computer name and local IP address in plaintext, followed by RC4-encrypted POST beacons sending basic fingerprinting data. ZeroT retrieves any stage-2 payloads from the C&C, which initially were plain, non-encoded PE payloads. Later, Bitmap (BMP) URLs were provided as a stage 2 payload instead of EXEs, using steganography to hide the payload."
