        "Initial Access": "In the TopHat campaign, attackers used Arabic language decoy documents related to current events within the Palestine Territories to entice victims. The attacks were deployed via malicious RTF files, self-extracting Windows executables, and RAR archives. The RTF files made HTTP requests to a bit.ly URL, which redirected to a malicious site. The self-extracting executables loaded a decoy document and spawned an instance of Scote malware.",
        "Execution": "The Scote malware family, once executed, provides backdoor access for an attacker. It collects command and control (C2) information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles. The bit.ly links obscured the C2 URLs, preventing victims from evaluating the legitimacy of the final site.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Scote malware employs various techniques to evade detection, including the use of legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information. The malware uses a series of techniques and tricks when loaded onto a victim machine, including layers of obfuscation.",
        "Command and Control": "Scote malware retrieves C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts. It uses this information to communicate with C2 servers and can accept commands to kill the malware, run 'ipconfig', run 'cmd.exe /C systeminfo', and load a DLL from a C2.",
        "Others": "The TopHat campaign overlaps with the previously reported DustySky campaign. The attacker tested their malware against multiple security products and submitted files that appear to be new variants of the DustySky Core malware. The campaign leveraged political events to target individuals or organizations within the Palestine region. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by this threat through tagging in AutoFocus, flagging of malicious domains, marking samples as malicious within WildFire, and blocking exploits used by the RTF files. Google, Pastebin, and bit.ly have been notified of the malicious content hosted on their services."
