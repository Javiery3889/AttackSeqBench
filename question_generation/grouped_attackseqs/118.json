    "file_name": "PowerLess Trojan_ Iranian APT Phosphorus Adds New PowerShell Backdoor for Espionage",
    "tactic_label": true,
    "rewrite": {
        "Initial Access": "The Cybereason Nocturnus Team reported that the Phosphorus group exploited the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities known as ProxyShell to gain initial access to target networks. This enabled the deployment of malware, including the PowerLess Backdoor.",
        "Execution": "The PowerLess Backdoor, developed by the Phosphorus group, executes PowerShell code within a .NET application context, avoiding the launch of 'powershell.exe' and thus evading detection by security products. The backdoor supports downloading additional payloads, such as a keylogger and an info stealer, and can execute arbitrary commands and kill processes.",
        "Persistence": "The PowerLess Backdoor creates persistence through scheduled tasks. The malware loader 'WindowsProcesses.exe' uses the Registry RunKeys or Startup Folder for boot or logon autostart execution. Additionally, the malware uses server software components like web shells for persistence.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Phosphorus group's PowerLess Backdoor evades detection by running PowerShell within a .NET application, not spawning 'powershell.exe'. The group also impairs defenses by disabling or modifying system firewalls and modifies the registry to aid in defense evasion.",
        "Credential Access": "The PowerLess Backdoor includes a keylogger module that captures user input, effectively accessing credentials. Additionally, OS credential dumping is performed using known LOLBIN techniques, such as leveraging 'Comsvcs.dll'.",
        "Discovery": "The Phosphorus group's PowerLess Backdoor has the capability to perform account discovery, specifically targeting local accounts on compromised systems.",
        "Lateral Movement": "After exploiting the Microsoft Exchange Server, the attackers used the PowerLess Backdoor to run reconnaissance commands and create persistence. They then dumped credentials and attempted to move laterally within the network.",
        "Collection": "The PowerLess Backdoor is capable of archiving collected data, including stealing browser data and keylogging information. The data is stored in paths such as 'C:\\Windows\\Temp\\Report.06E17A5A-7325-4325-8E5D-E172EBA7FC5BK' and 'C:\\Windows\\Temp\\cup.tmp'.",
        "Command and Control": "The PowerLess Backdoor communicates with a command and control (C2) server using web protocols and encrypted channels that employ symmetric cryptography. The backdoor also uses proxy techniques for C2 communication.",
        "Others": "The Phosphorus group, also known as APT35 or Charming Kitten, has been active in cyber espionage and offensive cyber attacks, operating in the interest of the Iranian regime. The group has targeted various sectors, including medical research, academia, human rights, and media, and has interfered with the US presidential elections. The Cybereason Nocturnus Team discovered a new set of tools developed by Phosphorus, including the PowerLess Backdoor, malware loaders, a browser info stealer, and a keylogger. The group has also been observed using open-source tools such as DiskCryptor, BitLocker, and Fast Reverse Proxy for RDP proxying. Connections were found between Phosphorus and the Memento Ransomware, suggesting a potential shift towards ransomware operations. The research emphasizes the importance of following the breadcrumbs, such as pivoting on known infrastructure or PDB paths, to uncover additional tools and connections to other operations."
