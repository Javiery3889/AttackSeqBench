        "Initial Access": "Over the last few weeks, a rootkit named CEIDPageLock has been distributed by the RIG Exploit kit. The rootkit, first discovered by 360 Security Center, was detected tampering with the homepage of a victim's browser, redirecting it to a site pretending to be 2345.com, a Chinese web directory.",
        "Persistence": "The dropper's main responsibility is to extract the driver from the file and save it in the \\Windows\\Temp directory as houzi.sys. The dropped driver, previously named CEID.sys, has a revoked certificate signed by \n[+] \n[+] Thawte Code Signing CA \n[+] thawte. After registering and starting the driver, the dropper sends the MAC address and user-id of the poisoned computer to the domain www[.]tj999[.]top.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The driver is a 32-bit kernel-mode driver that is launched among the standard system drivers during startup. It employs tricks to evade and hide from endpoint security products. The driver connects with one of two C&C hard-coded domains to download the homepage configuration to tamper with the browser. The homepage is downloaded encrypted from the C&C server.",
        "Collection": "CEIDPageLock operators gather browsing data on victims, monitoring the sites users visit and the duration of their visits. This information is used to target ad campaigns or sold to other companies for marketing purposes.",
        "Command and Control": "The driver's main functionality is to connect with one of two C&C hard-coded domains to download the desired homepage configuration to tamper with the browser.",
        "Others": "CEIDPageLock targets Chinese victims specifically, with a negligible number of infections outside of China. The malware adds a method of creating a registry key in safemon- 360safe's security product, as part of the rootkit installation routine. The rootkit sets the value \n[+] 0 under the registry key: \n[+] \\Registry\\Machine\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\360Safe\\safemon\\ATHPJUMP"
