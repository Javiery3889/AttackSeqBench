        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report describes two attack campaigns, Moafee and DragonOK, originating from different regions in China, using similar tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to infiltrate targets. Both campaigns employed custom-built backdoors and RATs such as CT/NewCT, Mongall, and Nflog, as well as publicly available RATs like PoisonIvy, to maintain access to victim networks. They also used a proxy tool named HTRAN to disguise their geographical location. The report suggests that these groups may be collaborating, have received the same training, or have a common toolkit supply chain.",
        "Resource Development": "The CTI report indicates that the attack groups Moafee and DragonOK used similar custom-built backdoors and RATs, as well as publicly available RATs like PoisonIvy, to maintain access to victim networks. They also used a proxy tool named HTRAN to disguise their geographical location when interacting with victim networks.",
        "Initial Access": "The primary attack vector used by both Moafee and DragonOK groups is spear-phishing emails. The emails were well-crafted and tailored to the target audience, using appropriate language and themes. Attachments in the emails were typically executable files embedded in ZIP archives or password-protected Microsoft Office documents.",
        "Execution": "The CTI report details the use of evasion techniques by both attack groups, including environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents. The first-stage payload for RATs called 'CT/NewCT' used by both groups employs a 'CPU core check' technique to detect the number of processor cores in the running environment. If only one core is detected, the payload quits, likely to avoid detection in virtualized environments such as sandboxes.",
        "Persistence": "The CTI report describes the use of registry entries by the CT/NewCT implant to ensure startup persistence. The implant creates a registry entry file called 'Windows.reg' and imports its contents into the registry using the command 'regedit.exe /s Windows.reg'. The contents of 'Windows.reg' are populated based on the Operating System (OS), with different entries for persistence depending on the OS version.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Both Moafee and DragonOK groups employed numerous common techniques to evade detection by sandbox environments, antivirus software, and gateway firewalls. These included environment-based evasion, the use of large file sizes, and password-protected documents. The 'CPU core check' technique was used to detect virtualized environments, and large null-padded files were used to evade detection by AV engines.",
        "Command and Control": "The CTI report details the command and control communication methods used by the backdoors and RATs employed by the Moafee and DragonOK groups. The NewCT RAT, for example, emits a 'POST' network beacon with hardcoded header values and encrypted data. The implant also has plugin functionality, allowing additional payloads to be loaded from the server.",
        "Others": "The CTI report provides insights into the geographical locations of the Moafee and DragonOK attack groups by analyzing their 'HTRAN' infrastructure. Moafee appears to operate out of Guangdong province and targets governments and military organizations with interests in the South China Sea, as well as organizations within the US defense industrial base. DragonOK operates out of Jiangsu province and targets high-tech and manufacturing companies in Japan and Taiwan. The report also acknowledges the contributions of various researchers to the analysis."
