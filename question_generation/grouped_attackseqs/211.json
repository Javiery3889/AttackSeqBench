        "Reconnaissance": "ESET research has uncovered GreyEnergy, a successor to the BlackEnergy APT group, which has been targeting energy companies and other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland for espionage and reconnaissance. GreyEnergy's activities include backdoor access, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging, password and credential stealing, and have been strategically targeting ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.",
        "Resource Development": "GreyEnergy's malware framework is modular, with functionality dependent on the combination of modules uploaded to targeted victim systems. The modules observed were used for espionage and reconnaissance purposes. GreyEnergy operators have been using a 'mini' backdoor deployed before admin rights are obtained and the full version is deployed. All remote C&C servers used by GreyEnergy were active Tor relays, an operational security technique to covertly connect to these servers.",
        "Initial Access": "GreyEnergy has used two distinct infection vectors: spearphishing and the compromise of public-facing web servers. When a vulnerable web server was hosted internally and connected to the rest of a targeted organization's network, the attacker would attempt to move laterally to other workstations. This technique is used not only as a primary infection vector but also as a backup reinfection vector.",
        "Persistence": "To cover their tracks, GreyEnergy's operators securely wipe the malware components from the victims' hard drives.",
        "Defense Evasion": "GreyEnergy employs stealth techniques, including pushing only selected modules to selected targets when needed, partial encryption of modules using AES-256, and running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection.",
        "Credential Access": "GreyEnergy operators use common external tools such as Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner for credential access.",
        "Lateral Movement": "GreyEnergy attackers deploy internal C&C proxies within the victims' networks to redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server on the internet. This stealth tactic makes it less suspicious as multiple computers are seen communicating with an internal server rather than a remote one.",
        "Command and Control": "GreyEnergy's internal C&C proxies redirect requests from infected nodes inside the network to an external C&C server on the internet, facilitating stealthy communication.",
        "Others": "GreyEnergy is linked to the BlackEnergy and TeleBots subgroups due to the appearance of GreyEnergy coinciding with the disappearance of BlackEnergy, shared interest in the energy sector and critical infrastructure, victims primarily in Ukraine and Poland, architectural similarities between the malware frameworks, and operational security techniques. GreyEnergy is considered a more modern toolkit with a greater focus on stealth compared to BlackEnergy. Some GreyEnergy samples were signed with a certificate from Advantech, indicating that these were most likely stolen, similar to Stuxnet and a recent Plead malware campaign. GreyEnergy also deployed an early version of the TeleBots' NotPetya worm, showing significant code reuse between this ransomware component and the GreyEnergy core module."
