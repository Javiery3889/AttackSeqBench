        "Execution": "The 'Penquin' Turla APT has been identified as targeting the Linux operating system with a new sample. This sample is a statically linked C/C++ executable that includes hidden network communications, arbitrary remote command execution, and remote management. It is based on public sources and stripped of symbol information, likely to increase analysis effort. The sample uses a stealth backdoor based on the cd00r sources, which does not require elevated privileges and cannot be detected via netstat. It operates by intercepting incoming packets and executing commands without root access.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Turla sample exhibits defense evasion by maintaining stealth without requiring elevated privileges and avoiding detection through common administrative tools like netstat.",
        "Command and Control": "The Turla sample communicates with a hardcoded command and control (C&C) domain, news-bbc.podzone[.]org, which resolves to the IP address 80.248.65.183. This domain is associated with the autonomous system AS30982 and is currently sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab. The sample does not initiate an initial network callback but maintains a hardcoded C&C string, suggesting recent activity in the Turla campaigns.",
        "Others": "The Turla APT, known for its complex operations, has been previously documented to target the Microsoft Windows family. The discovery of a Linux-targeting component suggests broader system support at victim sites and raises questions about the existence of other unknown Turla variants. The Linux Turla module has been active for years, with a file size of 627.2 kb to 637.6 kb and detected as HEUR:Backdoor.Linux.Turla.gen. The module uses PCAP libraries to capture packets and check for specific conditions based on an ID value input at startup by the attacker. Upon receiving a 'magic packet,' it connects to the source address and enters a loop for receiving remote commands, which are executed via '/bin/sh -c'. Further analysis is ongoing, and another Linux Turla module representing a different malware generation has been discovered, with a size of 801,561 bytes and a similar verdict name."
