        "Initial Access": "Cisco Talos has observed an ongoing malicious campaign since August 2021 from the Bitter APT group that appears to target users in Bangladesh. The campaign targets an elite unit of the Bangladesh's government with a themed lure document alleging to relate to the regular operational tasks in the victim's organization. The lure document is a spear-phishing email sent to high-ranking officers of the Rapid Action Battalion Unit of the Bangladesh police (RAB). The emails contain either a malicious RTF document or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet weaponized to exploit known vulnerabilities. Once the victim opens the maldoc, the Equation Editor application is automatically launched to run the embedded objects containing the shellcode to exploit known vulnerabilities described by CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798 and CVE-2018-0802 \n\n",
        "Command and Control": "The actor's infrastructure consists of the C2 server (helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com) and several domains that host the adversary's malware. The C2 domain resolved to 99[.]83[.]154[.]118 during the period of the campaign. This is a legitimate IP address for the AWS Global Accelerator networking service. The actor is using the AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to their actual C2 host, which is parked behind the legitimate AWS service. The actor has employed this technique to conceal their identity. The payload runs as a Windows security update service on the victim's machine and establishes communication with the C2 to remotely download and execute files in the victim's environment.\n\n"
