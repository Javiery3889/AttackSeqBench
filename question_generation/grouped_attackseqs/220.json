        "Reconnaissance": "The typical Volatile Cedar attack begins with a vulnerability scan of the target server. Once an exploitable vulnerability is located, it is used to inject a web shell code into the server.",
        "Initial Access": "The modus operandi for this attacker group initially targets publicly facing web servers, with both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery. Once in control of a server, the attackers further penetrate the targeted internal network via various means, including manual online hacking as well as an automated USB infection mechanism.",
        "Execution": "The Explosive Trojan contains 2 major components: the main executable binary and a DLL file containing backend API calls. The main executable file contains most of the Trojan logic, while the DLL primarily contains exported actionable API functions. The Explosive DLL file is dynamically loaded by the main executable at runtime whenever it is needed, and unloaded when the desired action is complete.",
        "Persistence": "Explosive can be installed with various service names, usually with no description value, and under different paths such as %systemroot%, %systemroot%\\system32, %systemroot%\\SysWOW64, %appdata%, %programfiles%\\VMware\\VMware Tools, and %programfiles%\\Notepad++. During its operation, Explosive uses several other files and directories for tasks such as storing keylog data and other information extracted from the victim's system.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Explosive Trojan goes to great lengths to hide from common detection tools and merge into its surroundings. AV detections are avoided by frequently checking AV results and changing versions and builds on all infected servers when any traces of detection appear. New versions are equipped with a dedicated thread to monitor memory consumption to prevent common server administration utilities from detecting the Explosive processes. API activities which may be considered suspicious are detached from the main logic file and contained in a separate DLL. Custom configurations are set on a per-target basis, including periods of 'radio silence' during which Explosive does not initiate any network communication.",
        "Credential Access": "The Explosive Trojan leverages its keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords entered on the target servers.",
        "Lateral Movement": "Evidence shows that the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network. More recent versions of the Explosive Trojan contain a configurable option for USB infection, which infects any writable mass storage device connected to the server.",
        "Command and Control": "The campaign uses a multi-tiered server backend framework to control the targeted systems, composed of C&C servers, static update servers, and dynamic update servers. The server framework is diverse, with some servers owned or hosted by the attackers, and others using publicly shared hosting frameworks or compromised legitimate servers.",
        "Others": "Malware attribution leads to the suspicion that Volatile Cedar originates from Lebanon. The campaign has been active for almost 3 years, evading detection by the majority of AV products. The attackers select only a handful of targets to avoid unnecessary exposure. New and custom versions are developed, compiled, and deployed specifically for certain targets. The Volatile Cedar target vertical distribution strongly aligns with nation-state/political-group interests, eliminating the possibility of financially motivated attackers."
