        "Credential Access": "Personas are linked through infrastructure to a number of credential collection sites, which we believe are being leveraged to gain access to accounts of targeted personnel. These sites, which at first glance appear to be the banal login pages for Yahoo, Google and Outlook Web Access, are linked to the NewsOnAir.org infrastructure and can be leveraged to gain covert access to sensitive accounts. Furthermore, other connected activity suggests additional, possibly nascent malicious capabilities that are being deployed or have previously been used.",
        "Command and Control": "Several of the sites hosted on com-login.mobi are fictitious login sites used to surreptitiously collect unsuspecting visitors' credentials. The sites, which appear to be Outlook Web Access, Yahoo and Google login pages, have been leveraged in spear-phishing messages containing links that appear to be banal. The following link was used to send users to a credential collection page prior to redirecting them to a YouTube clip posted by the persona Jeann Maclkin: http://youtube.com-login.mobi/watch.aspx?v=uYvYJtzT8js&feature=youtu.be&f=g&h=http://youtu.be/kxXA2_4Yv2A"
