        "Initial Access": "All three versions of the FAKEM RAT were distributed via spear-phishing emails using social engineering to lure targets into executing a malicious attachment. The malicious attachments were often Microsoft Word documents with code that exploits vulnerabilities such as CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2012-0158, and CVE-2009-3129. Some samples were simply executable (.EXE) files.",
        "Persistence": "After exploitation, an .EXE file packed with UPX is dropped. The malware copies itself to the %System% folder and adds a registry entry to enable its automatic execution at every system startup.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The network traffic the malware produces is designed to look like Windows Messenger traffic. The FAKEM RAT disguises its network traffic to look like various protocols, including Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger traffic, as well as HTML. The network communication is encrypted to ensure that the suspicious data passed between the compromised host and the attackers cannot be easily viewed in plain text.",
        "Collection": "The RAT controller issues commands to the compromised computer, which include executing shell commands, browsing directories, accessing running processes, accessing the Windows registry, taking snapshots of the desktop, accessing services, and uploading files from the compromised computer.",
        "Command and Control": "The RAT controller communicates with the compromised computer using encrypted network communication. The encryption is done at the bit level, with each byte XOR-ed by every letter in the string, YHCRA, and rotated 3 bits to the right after every XOR operation.",
        "Others": "The FAKEM RAT infrastructure includes domains such as vcvcvcvc.dyndns.org, zjhao.dtdns.net, avira.suroot.com, *.googmail.com, and freeavg.sytes.net. These domains are used as command-and-control servers for the malware. The research paper by Trend Micro Incorporated highlights the importance of understanding the attack tools, techniques, and infrastructure of adversaries to develop defensive strategies."
