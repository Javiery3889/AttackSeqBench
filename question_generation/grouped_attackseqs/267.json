        "Defense Evasion": "CosmicStrand is a sophisticated UEFI firmware rootkit attributed to an unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor. It is designed to achieve durable persistence and stealth, having been used since at least the end of 2016. The rootkit modifies firmware images of Gigabyte or ASUS motherboards with the H81 chipset, suggesting a common vulnerability. The rootkit is introduced into the CSMCORE DXE driver, redirecting the entry point to attacker-supplied code in the .reloc section, which is executed during system startup. This leads to the download and deployment of a malicious component inside Windows. CosmicStrand also attempts to disable PatchGuard, a Windows kernel security mechanism, to avoid detection.",
        "Command and Control": "CosmicStrand sets up a thread notify routine that gets invoked each time a new thread is created. It waits for a thread in winlogon.exe, then tests internet connectivity and interacts with the Transport Device Interface to generate network traffic. It sends specifically crafted UDP or TCP packets to its C2 server, update.bokts[.]com, to retrieve the final payload.",
        "Others": "CosmicStrand was discovered by GReAT and reported on by Qihoo360 in 2017. The infection process involves setting up hooks in the boot manager and Windows kernel loader to deploy a kernel-level implant into Windows systems at boot. The rootkit has been used to control victim machines using user-mode components or other undiscovered variants and C2 servers. Victims have been identified in China, Vietnam, Iran, and Russia, primarily private individuals. Code similarities suggest a link to the MyKings botnet and other Chinese-speaking threat actors. Two C2 servers have been identified, with activity periods indicating intermittent exploitation of victim machines. The discovery raises concerns about the potential use of UEFI attacks and the need for the cybersecurity industry to address this blind spot."
