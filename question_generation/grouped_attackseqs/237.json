        "Initial Access": "The Winnti malware implant was introduced to various targets by two known activity groups, BARIUM and LEAD. BARIUM initiated attacks by cultivating relationships on social media and then spear-phishing victims with unsophisticated malware installation vectors, such as malicious shortcut (.lnk) files, compiled HTML help (.chm) files, or Microsoft Office documents with macros or exploits. LEAD, known for industrial espionage, often emailed a Winnti installer to potential victims or gained access through brute-forcing remote access login credentials, SQL injection, or exploiting unpatched web servers.",
        "Persistence": "The Winnti malware implant, once installed, registered itself as a service to ensure persistence across reboots. This was detected by Windows Defender ATP, which raised behavioral alerts during the installation process.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Winnti was observed masquerading as a trusted, legitimate file to avoid detection. In two known intrusions in 2015, the implant DLL was named \"ASPNET_FILTER.DLL\" to disguise it as the DLL for the ASP.NET ISAPI Filter. Microsoft researchers used anomaly detection and supervised machine learning to identify the malicious file among benign data.",
        "Command and Control": "The Winnti implant used social network profiles, collaborative document editing sites, and blogs for command and control (C&C) communication. Windows Defender ATP was capable of detecting and stopping C&C communication to prevent further malicious activities.",
        "Others": "Windows Defender ATP provides extensive threat intelligence about activity groups like BARIUM and LEAD, including their tactics, techniques, and procedures. It also offers centralized response options to quickly stop threats, such as isolating compromised computers from the network and blocking the Winnti implant across the enterprise. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will enhance Windows Defender ATP's capabilities for detecting threats and providing response options like machine isolation and file blocking."
