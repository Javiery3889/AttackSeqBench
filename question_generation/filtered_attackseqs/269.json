        "Initial Access": "In September 2019, the Tick group targeted the Chinese offices of Japanese chemical industry organizations using spear phishing emails with an attachment containing the version RAT malware. In December 2019, media companies received spear phishing emails disguised as New Year's greetings, which delivered the LODEINFO malware when the embedded macro was activated. In January 2020, defense-related organizations were targeted with spear phishing emails carrying an Office macro file designed to drop LODEINFO malware.",
        "Execution": "The version RAT malware, developed to run only in a Windows 10 environment, includes remote-controlled functions such as execution of a remote shell, file uploading, and file downloading. LODEINFO malware operates by injecting malicious code into a svchost.exe process and possesses a command set similar to Unix commands.",
        "Persistence": "The version RAT malware uses DLL Search Order Hijacking to ensure it is automatically run and remains on the infected device after reboot. LODEINFO malware adds values to the Run registry to ensure it is automatically executed after the infected device is rebooted.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The version RAT malware uses a unique technique to identify the OS of the infected device, preventing it from running on any OS other than Windows 10. This technique is effective in circumventing dynamic analysis and sandbox-based security. LODEINFO malware is developed based on benign source code to escape analysis.",
        "Lateral Movement": "After confirming communication with the target device via a ping command using the version RAT remote shell, the attacker attempted lateral movement with a net use command.",
        "Command and Control": "The version RAT malware uses compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers, with communication data encrypted by AES and base64. LODEINFO malware regularly carries out HTTP POST communication to the C2 server and processes instructions included in the response.",
        "Others": "In February 2020, BlackTech's 32bit ELF malware running on Linux OS was uploaded to a public malware repository, indicating a possible victim in the IT service industry. The malware is similar to TsCookie, one of BlackTech's tools. Other tools discovered include a WebShell, a port forwarding tool, a GoogleAPI token updater, and a Linux version of Bifrose malware."
