        "Initial Access": "Operation Aurora, disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009. The attackers, identified as the Elderwood Group with ties to the People's Liberation Army, targeted Google and over 34 other organizations worldwide. The attack originated from China and aimed to access and potentially modify source code repositories at high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies.",
        "Execution": "The attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, which were unpatched and previously unknown to the developers. The exploit code used in the attack was later released into the public domain and incorporated into the Metasploit Framework.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The attackers used sophisticated methods to avoid detection and maintain a stealthy presence within the compromised networks. They masqueraded their backdoor connection as an SSL connection to command and control servers located in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts.",
        "Discovery": "The attackers conducted an extensive search within the compromised networks for other vulnerable systems and sources of intellectual property, specifically targeting the contents of source code repositories.",
        "Command and Control": "The attackers established command and control servers to communicate with the compromised systems. These servers were located in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, and some were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts.",
        "Impact": "The attack resulted in the theft of Google's intellectual property and sparked a diplomatic incident between the United States and China. It also led to Google reviewing its business operations in China and considering operating an uncensored search engine within the country or potentially leaving China altogether.",
        "Others": "The attack was named 'Operation Aurora' by Dmitri Alperovitch of McAfee, who discovered that 'Aurora' was part of the file path on the attacker's machine. The Elderwood Group, also known as the 'Beijing Group' by Dell Secureworks, specialized in attacking second-tier defense industry suppliers to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. The attack procedure involved infecting legitimate websites with malware, which then downloaded to computers that accessed the site, allowing the attackers to infiltrate the network connected to the infected computer."
