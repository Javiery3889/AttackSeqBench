        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report details the use of leaked-data search engines for intelligence gathering by cybercriminals. These engines, such as SheYun, provide access to a range of leaked data including bank account credentials and personal information. SheYun also offers a privacy-protection feature to prevent certain data from appearing in search results. Additionally, free search engines and forums like CnSeu are used for trading leaked data, where users can buy and sell using forum coins or credit points.",

These skimmers offer a business model that can impact SMBs. The Chinese underground market has expanded to include offerings like social engineering toolkits, which provide comprehensive tools for carrying out social engineering attacks, such as Social Engineering Master.",
        "Others": "The report discusses the thriving carding enterprise in the Chinese cybercriminal underground, driven by the growth of noncash transactions. Cybercriminals offer carding devices like PoS and ATM skimmers at reasonable prices. The report also mentions the mass production of skimmers and the availability of tutorials and materials for training in carding techniques. Additionally, the market offerings section provides an updated list of products and services available in the Chinese underground, including app-rank boosting, botnet rental, and various types of skimmers."
