        "Reconnaissance": "The Elfin espionage group, also known as APT33, has been actively scanning for vulnerable websites to identify potential targets for attacks or to create command and control (C&C) infrastructure. This activity has been ongoing since the group first became active in late 2015 or early 2016.",
        "Initial Access": "Elfin attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in WinRAR during February 2019 against a target in the chemical sector in Saudi Arabia. The exploit, delivered likely via spear-phishing, could permit code execution on unpatched computers. Symantec's proactive protection (Exp.CVE-2018-20250) prevented the targeted organization from being compromised.",
        "Execution": "Elfin has deployed a wide range of tools in its attacks, including custom malware such as Notestuk (Backdoor.Notestuk), Stonedrill (Trojan.Stonedrill), and an AutoIt backdoor, as well as commodity malware like Remcos (Backdoor.Remvio), DarkComet (Backdoor.Breut), Quasar RAT (Trojan.Quasar), Pupy RAT (Backdoor.Patpoopy), NanoCore (Trojan.Nancrat), and NetWeird (Trojan.Netweird.B).",
        "Persistence": "In a detailed case study of an attack on a U.S. organization, Elfin created a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file multiple times a day, ensuring persistence on the compromised system.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging on the infected machine, as part of their defense evasion tactics. They also deployed various versions of DarkComet, POSHC2 implants, and an AutoIt backdoor, along with further credential dumping activities.",
        "Credential Access": "Elfin deployed DarkComet, which included a credential dumping tool, to extract credentials from the compromised system.",
        "Command and Control": "Elfin used POSHC2, a proxy-aware C&C framework, to communicate with the compromised systems. They also used Quasar RAT and other tools to maintain control over the infected computers.",
        "Exfiltration": "Elfin exfiltrated data using a custom .NET FTP tool and a custom AutoIt FTP exfiltration tool known as FastUploader, designed to exfiltrate data at a faster rate than traditional FTP clients.",
        "Others": "Symantec has provided file-based protection against Elfin's tools and techniques, as well as threat intelligence through the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service. The Attack Investigation Team within Symantec Security Response is dedicated to investigating targeted attacks and enhancing protection in Symantec products."
