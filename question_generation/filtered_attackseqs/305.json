        "Initial Access": "Recent operations attributed to DeathStalker involve spear-phishing emails with attached archives containing a malicious LNK file. These LNK files, disguised as documents, lead to cmd.exe and initiate a sequence resulting in arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
        "Execution": "The execution process involves a multi-stage PowerShell-based implant called Powersing. Stage 0 extracts and executes the next element and a decoy document. Stage 1 is a PowerShell script with a C# assembly designed to connect to a dead drop resolver and obtain cryptographic material for decoding the last stage. Stage 2 is the actual malware implant that connects to the dead drop resolver to get the real C&C server address and enters a loop for orders.",
        "Persistence": "Powersing establishes persistence by creating a shortcut in the Windows startup folder pointing to the VBE startup script, which resembles stage 0 and leads to stage 2 upon system restart.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Powersing employs security software evasion with variation across samples. It may opt for alternative persistence methods or stop running based on the AV detected. It actively looks for traces of virtualization and malware analysis tools, reporting this information to the C&C server.",
        "Collection": "Powersing's tasks include capturing periodic screenshots from the victim's machine and executing arbitrary PowerShell scripts provided by the C&C server.",
        "Command and Control": "Communications with the C&C server involve JSON-encoded objects. Powersing leverages public services as dead drop resolvers to store data at fixed URLs, blending initial backdoor communications into legitimate traffic.",
        "Others": "DeathStalker is a threat group targeting law firms and companies in the financial sector, not motivated by financial gain but rather gathering sensitive business information. They are suspected to be mercenaries offering hacking-for-hire services. DeathStalker has been active since at least 2018, with possible activities dating back to 2012. They have been leveraging COVID-19 for implant deployment since March 2020. The group is still developing its toolset, with Powersing, Janicab, and Evilnum being part of their arsenal, showing similarities in distribution, C&C communication, and capabilities. DeathStalker's primary targets are in the financial sector, with activities identified in multiple countries. Defenders are advised to monitor process creation related to Windows scripting language interpreters and to include LNK-based infection chains in security assessments."
