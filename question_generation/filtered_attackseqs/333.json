        "Initial Access": "Since at least 2016, UNC1151 has registered credential theft domains that spoof legitimate websites to steal victim credentials. The group has targeted a variety of entities, focusing on Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Germany, as well as Belarusian dissidents, media, and journalists. UNC1151 has also conducted malware-based intrusions, with significant activities against Ukrainian government entities and some targeting of Lithuania and Poland. They have not targeted Russian or Belarusian state entities but have spear-phished intergovernmental organizations dealing with former-Soviet states.",
        "Credential Access": "UNC1151 has used credential harvesting domains to spoof legitimate webmail providers, generic login pages, and the legitimate websites of their targets. These domains are sent to victims via phishing emails. The group has improved its technical skills over time, shifting from using Freenom to Cloudflare services, possibly indicating increased resources. UNC1151 has used a proprietary suite of malware, including HIDDENVALUE and HALFSHELL, and has infrequently been observed using open source or publicly available tools. They have yet to be seen conducting post-compromise activity.",
        "Others": "Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that UNC1151 is linked to the Belarusian government and possibly the Belarusian military, based on technical and geopolitical indicators. The group's cyber espionage activities align with Belarusian government interests, focusing on obtaining confidential information without monetization efforts. UNC1151's operations have evolved with contiguous TTPs since 2017, suggesting the maturation of a single organization. Ghostwriter information operations, assessed to be supported by Belarus, have shifted focus since mid-2020 to align more closely with Belarusian interests, particularly following the disputed 2020 Belarusian elections. The operations have targeted narratives critical of NATO and neighboring governments, especially Lithuania and Poland. The sources of written content for Ghostwriter operations and the malware used by UNC1151 remain uncertain, with the possibility of involvement from additional organizations or countries. Mandiant has not found direct evidence of Russian government involvement in UNC1151 or Ghostwriter operations, despite some TTP overlaps and consistency with Russian goals."
