        "Initial Access": "The initial vector was identified as an INP file exploiting CVE-2017-12824. The file uses an ole stream to launch the first binary file, which then extracts a file to the temp folder and creates a thread for the second PE file.",
        "Execution": "The second PE file begins by checking the environment using the CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent function as an anti-forensic technique. It then creates persistence through a RunOnce key in the registry and uses the CreateToolhelp32snapshot function to get a snapshot of all processes, targeting the explorer process.",
        "Persistence": "Persistence is achieved by creating a RunOnce key in the registry (\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce Putty explorer.exe CurrentUserC:\\file.exe).",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware employs defense evasion by checking the environment using the CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent function and by using Process Hollowing to inject into a process for communication with the C2.",
        "Discovery": "The malware performs discovery by obtaining the name of the user and using the CreateToolhelp32snapshot function to identify the explorer process.",
        "Command and Control": "The malware establishes command and control by creating a process through Process Hollowing, which awaits further instructions from the C2. However, the C2 was down at the time of submission to VirusTotal, preventing further analysis.",
        "Others": "The malware sample is associated with APTPatchwork and is consistent with the Indian APT group Patchwork. The payload is linked to the Professional version of Inpage (2.21), commonly used in Pakistan. The C2 is hosted on Amazon CloudFront, and the payload is connected to recent events involving delegations from the Pakistan Naval and Air Force Academies visiting Azerbaijan."
