        "Initial Access": "Check Point Research identified an ongoing spear-phishing campaign targeting the Afghan government, which is part of a long-running activity by the APT group IndigoZebra, targeting Central Asia since at least 2014. The campaign involved sending emails from an employee of the President's Office in Afghanistan to the National Security Council, containing a password-protected RAR archive named 'NSC Press conference.rar'. The archive, when extracted, revealed an executable file 'NSC Press conference.exe', which acted as a dropper.",
        "Execution": "Upon execution, the dropper would open the first document on the victim's desktop to reduce suspicion and then proceed to drop and execute the backdoor 'C:\\users\\public\\spools.exe'.",
        "Persistence": "The backdoor establishes persistence by setting the 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\load' registry key to point to its executable, ensuring it runs when any user logs on.",
        "Defense Evasion": "To evade detection, the backdoor uses 'stackstrings' obfuscation to hide its persistence and C&C communication mechanisms.",
        "Discovery": "Post-infection, the threat actor conducted fingerprinting and reconnaissance, including downloading and executing a NetBIOS scanner tool, using built-in Windows networking utilities, and accessing files on the Desktop.",
        "Command and Control": "The backdoor, named BoxCaon, uses Dropbox as a C&C server, leveraging the Dropbox API with a hardcoded bearer access token to download, upload, and execute files. It creates a unique folder for the victim in the attacker-controlled Dropbox account, named after the victim's MAC address, and communicates using clear text commands.",
        "Others": "IndigoZebra APT has been active since at least 2014, targeting Central Asian countries with tools like the xCaon backdoor and its variants. The latest variant, BoxCaon, uses Dropbox for C&C communication. The operation focuses on political entities in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, with infrastructure hosted on ASN 20473 (CHOOPA) since 2019. The actor's campaigns continue to expand with new targets and toolsets. Check Point products block this attack from the initial step."
