Other methods included archive files containing a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking, and direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.",
        "Execution": "The Aria-body loader, specific to the Naikon APT group, was responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, decrypting configuration data, contacting C&C servers, and loading the Aria-body backdoor. The loader's functionality varied slightly across versions, but its main tasks remained consistent since 2017.",
        "Persistence": "The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key. Some variants also injected themselves into processes such as 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.",
        "Defense Evasion": "To evade detection, the Naikon APT group operated their C&C servers within limited daily windows, going online for only a few hours each day. They also used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.",
        "Discovery": "The Aria-body backdoor gathered information from the victim's machine, including host-name, computer-name, username, domain name, windows version, processor speed, MachineGuid, system architecture, and public IP. It also collected data on installed software, active processes, running windows, TCP and UDP table status, and services data.",
        "Collection": "The Aria-body backdoor had capabilities to create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.",
        "Command and Control": "The Naikon APT group used HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication, sending collected data to the C&C domain along with an XORed password. The backdoor kept listening for additional commands from the server, which were executed upon receipt.",
        "Others": "The Naikon APT group targeted national government entities in the Asia Pacific region, including ministries of foreign affairs, science and technology ministries, and government-owned companies. They expanded their footholds by launching attacks from one compromised government entity to another. The group used servers within infected ministries as C&C servers to collect, relay, and route stolen data. The Aria-body backdoor included modules for USB data gathering, keylogging, reverse socks proxy, and loading extensions. The group's infrastructure primarily used GoDaddy for domain registration and Alibaba for hosting. Attribution to the Naikon APT group was made based on similarities in targeting, strings, hashing functions, code, and infrastructure overlap with previous operations."
