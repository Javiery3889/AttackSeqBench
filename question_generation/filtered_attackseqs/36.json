        "Initial Access": "Whitefly, an espionage group targeting Singapore, initiates its attacks by sending spear-phishing emails containing a dropper disguised as a document or image, often related to job openings or industry-specific information. The dropper, once opened, executes a loader named Trojan.Vcrodat.",
        "Execution": "The loader Trojan.Vcrodat, used by Whitefly, employs search order hijacking to execute malicious DLLs named identically to legitimate security software DLLs, gaining elevated privileges. It then loads an encrypted payload that establishes communication with a command and control (C&C) domain, downloading additional tools for further operations.",
        "Persistence": "Whitefly aims to maintain long-term access within compromised organizations, often for months, to exfiltrate large volumes of information. It deploys tools like a simple remote shell and Termite (Hacktool.Rootkit) to facilitate ongoing communication and control over infected computers.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "Whitefly exploits a known Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) using an open-source tool and leverages Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) to obtain credentials, allowing them to compromise additional machines and escalate privileges within the network.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Whitefly utilizes search order hijacking to ensure execution of its malicious DLLs, targeting security applications to potentially gain higher privileges. The group also uses custom malware and open-source hacking tools to remain undetected while maintaining a presence on networks.",
        "Credential Access": "The group heavily relies on tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials, which are then used to compromise more machines on the network and facilitate lateral movement.",
        "Discovery": "After initial infection, Whitefly maps the network and infects further computers, using publicly available tools and exploiting vulnerabilities to discover and control more systems.",
        "Lateral Movement": "Using stolen credentials, Whitefly compromises additional machines on the network, repeating the process to gain access to desired data and expand their control within the organization.",
        "Collection": "Whitefly's objective is to steal large volumes of sensitive information, which involves remaining in the network for extended periods and using tools to facilitate data theft.",
        "Command and Control": "Whitefly configures multiple C&C domains for each target, using encrypted payloads to communicate with infected computers and download additional tools for command and control.",
        "Exfiltration": "The group's long-term presence within targeted organizations is leveraged to exfiltrate large volumes of information over time.",
        "Others": "Whitefly has been active since at least 2017, targeting various sectors in Singapore. The group is linked to the SingHealth breach and other attacks in the region. Symantec has identified multiple indicators of compromise and has protections in place against Whitefly's tactics. The Attack Investigation Team at Symantec Security Response is dedicated to investigating targeted attacks and enhancing protection in Symantec products."
