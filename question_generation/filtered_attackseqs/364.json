        "Resource Development": "Recorded Future's Insikt Group conducted a study on malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure, identifying servers through proactive scanning and collection methods. The study, current as of December 10, 2021, tracks the creation and modification of new malicious infrastructure for various toolkits, custom malware, and RATs. Since 2017, Insikt Group has created detections for 80 families, including RATs, APT malware, botnet families, and other commodity tools. Over 10,000 unique C2 servers were observed in 2021 across these families. The data was sourced from the Recorded Future Platform.",
        "Initial Access": "Before a server can be used maliciously by a threat actor, it must be acquired through compromise or legitimate purchase. The software is then installed, configurations are tuned, SSL certificates are registered, and files are added to the server. The actors access it via panel login, SSH, or RDP, and expose the malware controller on a port to allow data transfer from the victim and to administer commands to infections.",
        "Command and Control": "Recorded Future observed over 10,000 unique C2 servers in 2021, with Cobalt Strike Team Servers and botnet families applying more resiliency and stealth measures. The most commonly observed C2 families were Cobalt Strike Team Servers, Meterpreter, Metasploit, QakBot, and TrickBot. The study also noted that 25% of detected servers were not referenced in open sources and were only identified on the Recorded Future Command and Control source. An average of a 35-day lead time was observed between when a C2 server is detected by scanning efforts and when it is reported in other sources.",
        "Others": "Recorded Future anticipates further insulation and modification of C2 servers in 2022 to avoid detection. TrickBot operators have hardened their infrastructure, and similar methods are expected to be employed by Cobalt Strike users. The C2 environment is expected to diversify, with new malware families and C2 frameworks likely to be aware of threat intelligence measures. Mitigations include using the Recorded Future Platform to identify actively exploited vulnerabilities, keeping systems and software up to date, implementing multi-factor authentication for remote access services, password-protecting sensitive files, and employing detection-in-depth methodologies."
