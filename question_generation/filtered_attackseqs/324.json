        "Command and Control": "FireEye has identified binaries coded to receive instructions from a set of command and control (C2) servers instructing participating bots to attack Next Media-owned websites and the HKGolden forum. These binaries are W32 Cabinet self-extracting files that drop a variant of an older DDoS tool known as KernelBot. The KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions from C2 servers hard-coded directly into the sample. FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDOS C2 servers in this campaign. The encoded configuration file decodes to a set of instructions for the KernelBot network to attack various domains and IPs, primarily associated with Next Media or Apple daily websites, with the exception of a few IPs hosting the HKGolden forum.",
        "Impact": "Attackers have launched a series of Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong. Websites belonging to Next Media's Apple Daily publication have suffered from an ongoing DDoS attack that brought down its email system for hours. Next Media's network has suffered a 'total failure' as a result of these attacks. Additionally, at least one member of the popular online forum HKGolden was arrested for posting messages encouraging support for the OccupyCentral Pro Democracy movement.",
        "Others": "The DDoS attacks are linked to previously observed APT activity, including Operation Poisoned Hurricane. The overlap in the tools and infrastructure used by China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) actors and the DDoS attack activity suggests potential relationships, symbiosis, and tool sharing between patriotic hacker activities designed to disrupt anti-government activists in China, and the APT activity focused on IP theft and espionage. The use of digital certificates previously used by APT actors to sign binaries in previous intrusion operations, such as the QTI International and CallTogether code signing certificates, further links these DDoS attacks to previous APT activity. The evidence may indicate that a common quartermaster supports both the DDoS attacks and ongoing intrusion activity. The Chinese government is the entity most likely to be interested in achieving both of these objectives."
