        "Resource Development": "The Syrian Malware Team, which is pro-Syrian government and has ties to the Syrian Electronic Army, has been using a .NET based RAT called BlackWorm to infiltrate targets. The original BlackWorm builder was co-authored by Naser AlMutairi, also known as 'njq8', from Kuwait, who has a history of developing RATs such as njw0rm, njRAT/LV, and H-worm/Houdini. Another version, BlackWorm Dark Edition (v2.1), was enhanced by an author known as Black.Hacker. The Syrian Malware Team has been active since at least January 1, 2011, with their Facebook page indicating ongoing activity.",
        "Defense Evasion": "BlackWorm RAT, used by the Syrian Malware Team, includes features for defense evasion such as disabling Task Manager, copying itself to USB drives and P2P share locations, and killing analysis processes like Wireshark and MBAM. The Dark Edition of BlackWorm also has capabilities to bypass UAC, disable host firewalls, and spread over network shares.",
        "Command and Control": "The Syrian Malware Team uses BlackWorm RAT for command and control, with the malware communicating to specific IP addresses and ports. The command structure includes commands like ping, close server, restart server, send file, download, DDoS, and more. The Dark Edition of BlackWorm communicates with a command structure that includes the hostname, username, and active window name, among other details.",
        "Others": "The Syrian Malware Team's use of BlackWorm RAT has been linked to various attacks, with the malware author 'njq8' ceasing development activities following a lawsuit by Microsoft. The team's activities include profiling targets and orchestrating attacks, with some members publicly posting malware-related items on Facebook. Samples of BlackWorm Dark Edition used by the team often include strings like 'Syrian Malware' or 'Syrian Malware Team' in the C2 communications or binary strings. The malware has been seen communicating with domains associated with Syria, and the use of Arabic strings in the malware suggests targeting specific regions or individuals."
