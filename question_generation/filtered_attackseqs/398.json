        "Initial Access": "The cybercriminal network behind the attack recruited individuals, referred to as 'mules', to open new bank accounts using counterfeit documents likely provided by the network. These mules then requested debit/ATM cards for the new accounts, which were later distributed outside the country for subsequent fraudulent use. The attackers gained initial entry into the bank's network through opportunistic phishing emails to employees, which led to the creation of backdoors on compromised systems. Social engineering techniques were also employed to obtain backdoor access.",
        "Execution": "The attackers executed several malicious payloads on the processor's network, including the installation of a legitimate monitoring tool, 'Mipko' (advertised as 'Employee Monitor'), on the processor's Terminal Server. This tool captured full information, including screen captures and keystrokes, for all users who logged into the system and accessed the card management application.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "After gaining initial access to the bank's network, the attackers leveraged control weaknesses in the Windows network to launch lateral movement attacks, obtain 'Keys to the Kingdom', and compromise the bank network. They also compromised the Enterprise Admin account on the processor's network, which gave them full access to the infrastructure.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Attackers adopted the tactic of 'living off the land', using legitimate Windows and PowerShell commands combined with tools such as PSExec for lateral movement, and plink.exe to access RDP over an established SSH tunnel. They also used commercial monitoring applications and 'Cobalt Strike Beacon' to maintain backdoor connections.",
        "Credential Access": "The attackers identified bank employee accounts on the card management application with authorization to request and approve changes to customer debit cards. They used these credentials to manipulate the cards associated with the rogue accounts created earlier.",
        "Lateral Movement": "The attackers compromised the third-party processor's network after numerous attempts, leveraging the bank's established connectivity with the processor. They used captured credentials to connect to the processor's network and executed reconnaissance of the card processing service.",
        "Command and Control": "The attackers coordinated ATM withdrawals across multiple cities and countries, using command and control with physical mules for coordinated cash outs. They carefully planned the choice of ATM locations based on criteria such as location, degree of physical security, and the ability to dispense substantial amounts of cash.",
        "Impact": "The attackers manipulated the bank's internal systems to enable high overdraft levels and removed anti-fraud controls for specific accounts. They then used the manipulated debit cards to perform cash withdrawals from various ATMs, removing up to USD$10 million from each bank. The final stage of the operation took almost five hours to complete, with simultaneous debit card withdrawals across the geographic region."
