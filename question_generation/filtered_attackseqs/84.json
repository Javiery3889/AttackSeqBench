        "Persistence": "In September, Mandiant Consulting discovered a financially motivated threat group, FIN1, using a bootkit named Nemesis to persistently target payment card data. This bootkit infects the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR), allowing it to execute before the Windows operating system boots, making detection and removal challenging. The malware's installation location ensures it remains even after an operating system reinstallation, which is typically considered an effective malware removal method.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Nemesis bootkit, used by the threat group FIN1, evades detection by executing before the Windows operating system fully loads, bypassing typical operating system integrity checks. Anti-virus software does not scan the malicious boot loader components as they are stored in a custom virtual file system (VFS) outside the Windows file system. Additionally, the malware components are either in the VFS or the Windows registry, which is not usually scanned by anti-virus software. The only likely detection point is live memory, but unless the bootkit and VFS components are removed, the malware will execute and load with every system start.",
        "Command and Control": "The Nemesis malware ecosystem includes backdoors with support for various network protocols and communication channels for command and control (CnC). It provides capabilities such as file transfer, screen capture, keystroke logging, process injection, process manipulation, and task scheduling. FIN1 continually updated Nemesis during their access to the victim environment, deploying different variants and adding functionality.",
        "Others": "The threat group FIN1, potentially located in Russia or a Russian-speaking country, has been active for several years, targeting financial services organizations to steal monetizable data. The Nemesis malware ecosystem, developed by FIN1, has been continually updated with new variants and functionalities. The BOOTRASH utility, part of Nemesis, modifies the system's VBR to hijack the boot process and load Nemesis components before the Windows operating system code. This technique is rare and makes the malware difficult to detect and eradicate. Other bootkits, such as TDL4, Necurs, and Rovnix, have been documented in the past. The use of bootkits for persistence suggests that some threat actors have access to more sophisticated toolsets and may deploy them selectively based on the difficulty of penetrating the victim organization or the value of the targeted data. Incident responders and system administrators need tools that can access and search raw disks for evidence of bootkits, as re-installing the operating system is no longer a sufficient response to such compromises."
