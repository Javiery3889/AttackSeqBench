        "Initial Access": "Operation Pawn Storm refers to espionage attacks by a group targeting military, embassy, and defense contractor personnel from the United States and its allies. The threat actors used spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, phishing websites, and exploits injected into legitimate websites. They utilized a nonmalicious JavaScript to target Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) users from selected organizations, making the OWA phishing attacks extremely effective.",
        "Execution": "The Operation Pawn Storm attacks involved multistage downloaders, specifically SEDNIT/Sofacy malware, which provided additional protection against detection. The attacks comprised several stages, with the initial phase involving a decoy document displayed upon opening an email attachment, while the exploit ran in the background, dropping a downloader component. The second phase involved the downloader communicating with a C&C server and downloading a dropper that installed a keylogger, which then sent captured information back to the C&C server.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The use of multistage downloaders in Operation Pawn Storm attacks aimed to confuse targets' IT administrators, making it hard to string attack components together and evade detection. The attackers used consistent filenames for different components from 2010 to the present, with earlier attacks being more elaborate and complex compared to the more streamlined attacks seen in 2014. Both past and current attack chains are still used by threat actors to ensure detection evasion.",
        "Credential Access": "Operation Pawn Storm used next-level spear-phishing tactics to obtain email credentials of primarily military, embassy, and defense contractor personnel. The attackers crafted emails to redirect targets to phishing websites with domain names similar to well-known conferences and media outfits. These websites executed a nonmalicious JavaScript that tricked victims into reentering their credentials on fake OWA log-in pages. The attacks were successful if victims used OWA and clicked the embedded links via the web portal's preview pane.",
        "Command and Control": "The Operation Pawn Storm attacks involved communication with remote command-and-control (C&C) servers. The SEDNIT malware variants used in the attacks logged affected users' keystrokes, stole system information, and sent stolen information to C&C servers. The attackers aimed to steal sensitive information from victims' computers while effectively evading detection."
