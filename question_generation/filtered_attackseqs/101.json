        "Initial Access": "The malware known as \"Machete\" is distributed through social engineering tactics, including spear-phishing emails and a fake blog website. No evidence suggests the use of exploits targeting zero-day vulnerabilities. The attackers and victims are both Spanish-speaking. The malware is embedded in PowerPoint presentations disguised as Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archives with names such as 'Hermosa XXX.pps.rar', 'Suntzu.rar', 'El arte de la guerra.rar', and 'Hot brazilian XXX.rar'. These files, when opened, install the malware on the target system.",
        "Persistence": "On infected machines, \"Machete\" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs the malware in 'appdata/ MicroDes/'. It also creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.",
        "Collection": "\"Machete\" is capable of logging keystrokes, capturing audio from the computer's microphone, taking screenshots, capturing geolocation data, taking photos from the computer's web camera, copying files to a remote server, copying files to a special USB device if inserted, and hijacking the clipboard to capture information from the target machine.",
        "Others": "The campaign, believed to have started in 2010 and renewed in 2012, may still be active. Victims are primarily located in Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Russia, Cuba, and Spain, and include high-profile targets such as intelligence services, military, embassies, and government institutions. The malware uses Python embedded into Windows executables, which is unusual and suggests ease of coding rather than multi-platform support. Infrastructure for Mac OS X and Unix victims, as well as a mobile (Android) component, were also discovered. Indicators of Compromise include suspicious domains like 'java.serveblog.net', 'agaliarept.com', and others, as well as a known infection artifact 'hxxp://name.domain.org/nickname/set/Signed_Update.jar'. Malicious samples related to this attack are detected by Kaspersky Lab products as Trojan-Spy.Python.Ragua."
