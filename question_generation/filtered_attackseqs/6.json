        "Initial Access": "The Machete campaign utilized spearphishing as the primary method for initial access. Victims received emails containing either a link to download a compressed file from an external server or a zipped file with malicious contents. These emails were crafted to appear legitimate, often using real documents previously stolen from other victims as decoys. The documents used as decoys, such as classified military documents and Radiogramas, were sent and received legitimately several times a day by targets, making the phishing attempts highly convincing.",
        "Execution": "Machete's execution process involved the use of a downloader as the first stage, which installed the backdoor components on the compromised system. The downloader was a self-extracting file that opened a PDF or Microsoft Office file as a decoy and then ran the downloader executable. The actual Machete malware was then downloaded, decrypted, and executed.",
        "Persistence": "To maintain persistence, Machete created Windows Task Scheduler tasks to ensure the continued execution of its components. The malware also used hidden files and directories to avoid detection and ensure its components could survive system restarts and user logouts.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Machete employed various defense evasion techniques, including obfuscation of Python scripts, software packing using self-extracting files, and masquerading file and task names to impersonate legitimate applications like Google Chrome, Java, Dropbox, Adobe Reader, and Python executables.",
        "Credential Access": "Machete targeted credentials by scanning the compromised system for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrating files with stored credentials for several browsers.",
        "Discovery": "The Machete malware conducted discovery activities by listing all nearby Wi-Fi networks using the netsh command, detecting newly inserted devices, producing file listings for exfiltration, and enumerating running processes in search of browsers. It also gathered browser data such as bookmarks and reported window names along with keylogger information.",
        "Collection": "Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder where files and logs were encrypted.",
        "Command and Control": "Machete used standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C&C) servers. It also implemented fallback channels, using HTTP to exfiltrate documents if FTP was unavailable. The malware could download additional files for execution on the victim's machine and used FTP and HTTP for C&C communication.",
        "Exfiltration": "Machete automatically exfiltrated all collected files to remote servers. The data was encrypted with AES before transmission, and in some versions, it was also base64 encoded. Browser profile data was compressed as .zip files prior to exfiltration. Data was exfiltrated over the same channel used for C&C, and scheduled transfers were set up to send data to the C&C server every 10 minutes. Additionally, data from all drives in a compromised system could be copied to a removable drive if a special file was present on that drive."
