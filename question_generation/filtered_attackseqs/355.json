        "Reconnaissance": "Iranian threat actors conducted a cyber espionage operation named NEWSCASTER since 2011, using fake personas on social media to connect with US officials and gather information. They created over a dozen fake personas, including falsified identities from news organizations and attractive women profiles, supported by a fictitious news organization called NewsOnAir.org. The attackers connected with over 2,000 individuals to access information on their location, activities, and relationships.",
        "Resource Development": "The NEWSCASTER operation involved creating fake personas and a fictitious news organization to support their espionage activities. They used these personas to establish connections on social media platforms and harvest credentials.",
        "Initial Access": "The Iranian hackers used social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, and Blogger to initiate their attack. They sent spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages to capture credentials, gaining initial access to their targets' networks.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The NEWSCASTER campaign, while not technically sophisticated, was effective and under the radar. The attackers used low-tech approaches to avoid traditional security defenses, exploiting social media and the human element, which is often the weakest link in security.",
        "Credential Access": "The campaign focused on credential harvesting and reconnaissance. The attackers used social media connections to harvest corporate and personal email credentials, which could be used for further lateral movements within the targeted networks.",
        "Lateral Movement": "After establishing connections on social media, the attackers used the harvested credentials to potentially move laterally within the networks of their targets, which included senior U.S. military and diplomatic personnel, congressional personnel, journalists, think tanks, and defense contractors in the U.S. and Israel, among others.",
        "Command and Control": "The campaign leveraged malware with the capability to exfiltrate data, although the malware used was not particularly sophisticated.",
        "Others": "The NEWSCASTER operation targeted victims in the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and vocal supporters of Israel, suggesting an interest in political, military, diplomatic, and technical intelligence. The attackers maintained a regular work schedule consistent with Tehran's timezone, and their targets and technical indicators led iSIGHT Partners to believe the campaign originated from Iran. iSIGHT Partners coordinated with the FBI and notified social networks, leading to the removal of malicious personas from Facebook and LinkedIn. The report comes after FireEye suggested that Iranian attackers' methodologies have become more consistent with other advanced persistent threat actors in Iran following cyber attacks against Iran in the late 2000s."
