        "Initial Access": "Cisco Talos has observed a new campaign targeting Turkish private organizations and governmental institutions. This campaign utilizes malicious PDFs, XLS files, and Windows executables to deploy malicious PowerShell-based downloaders acting as initial footholds into the target's enterprise. The PDF files typically show an error message and ask the user to click on a link to resolve the issue and display the correct format/extension of the document. Once the victim clicks on the download button, the endpoint receives a second stage, which can be either a malicious XLS file or a Windows executable that proceeds with the infection as described earlier.",
        "Persistence": "The infection chain instrumented by the VBA macros consist of creating three key artifacts on the infected endpoint: a Registry key for persistence, a malicious VB script intermediate component that the macro sets up for persistence, and a malicious PowerShell-based downloader script. The VB script's persistence is set up by creating a malicious Registry Run for the infected user: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run | <random>. This campaign relies on the use of a LoLBin to execute the malicious VBScript. In some instances, the attackers make use of a LoLBin DLL called pcwutl.dll, which is part of the operating system, to execute the VBScript on reboot or re-login.",
        "Command and Control": "This group frequently relies on the use of DNS as part of their means to contact the command and control (C2), while the initial contact with hosting servers is done via HTTP. Their initial payloads usually use PowerShell and Visual Basic scripting along with LoLBins to assist in the initial stages of the infection."
