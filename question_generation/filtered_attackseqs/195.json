        "Reconnaissance": "The threat actor Tortoiseshell created a fake veteran hiring website (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com) to conduct reconnaissance. The website prompted users to download an app, which was a malware downloader. The downloaded reconnaissance tool, named 'bird.exe' with the internal name Liderc, collected extensive information from the victim's machine, including date, time, drivers, system patch level, number of processors, network configuration, hardware, firmware versions, domain controller, admin name, account list, and screen size using WMI.",
        "Initial Access": "Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from the fraudulent website hiremilitaryheroes[.]com, which closely resembled the legitimate service hiringourheroes.org. The app served as a malware downloader.",
        "Execution": "The malware downloader executed two binaries retrieved from hxxp://199[.]187[.]208[.]75/MyWS.asmx/GetUpdate?val=UID. These binaries were stored in base64 and included a reconnaissance tool and a Remote Administrative Tool (RAT), which was executed as a service.",
        "Persistence": "The RAT named 'IvizTech' was installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence on the victim's system.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The malware employed defense evasion by checking if Google was reachable before proceeding with the installation. If unreachable, the installation stopped, potentially evading network-based defenses that block known malicious domains. The RAT was designed to be modular, allowing the attacker to update the Command and Control (C2) server without recompiling, and required the installer for access, complicating analysis by researchers.",
        "Discovery": "The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' performed discovery by collecting detailed information about the victim's machine, which could be used for further attacks.",
        "Command and Control": "The RAT communicated with a C2 server, with the IP address provided as an argument to the service. This design was intended to prevent direct access to the C2 server without the installer, making it more difficult for researchers to analyze the malware.",
        "Others": "The CTI report by Cisco Talos, authored by Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres with contributions from Jungsoo An, details the actions of Tortoiseshell, including the creation of a fake veteran hiring website to host malware. The report also mentions the use of hardcoded email credentials within the installer for error reporting, indicating poor operational security (OPSEC). Additionally, the report provides information on the network infrastructure used by Tortoiseshell, including IP addresses and domains, as well as samples of the installers and reconnaissance PE. It also suggests the use of intrusion prevention systems like SNORT, Cisco AMP for Endpoints, Cisco Cloud Web Security, Email Security, Network Security appliances, AMP Threat Grid, and Umbrella to detect and block threats related to Tortoiseshell."
