        "Initial Access": "Buckeye, also known as APT3, Gothic Panda, UPS Team, and TG-0110, has been actively targeting organizations in Hong Kong since June 2015. The group employs spear-phishing emails with malicious .zip attachments containing a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file, which ultimately leads to the download and execution of Backdoor.Pirpi on the victim's computer.",
        "Defense Evasion": "Buckeye modifies open source hacking tools to evade detection. They use Backdoor.Pirpi, a remote access Trojan, to maintain a presence on the network and collect information about the target's local network, including domain controllers and workstations.",
        "Credential Access": "Buckeye employs various tools to gather credentials, including a keylogger that records keystrokes and network information, and tools like ChromePass and Lazagne for recovering passwords stored in browsers and other applications.",
        "Collection": "Buckeye appears to focus on file and print servers, suggesting an interest in stealing documents. The group's use of zero-day exploits, customized tools, and targeting of specific organizations indicate that they are likely a state-sponsored cyberespionage group.",
        "Others": "Symantec has been tracking Buckeye's activities since 2009, with attacks on various organizations. The group has used zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash in the past. Symantec and Blue Coat Systems have enhanced protection capabilities against Buckeye's campaigns. Symantec and Norton products detect Backdoor.Pirpi and its variants, and an intrusion prevention system is in place to identify Backdoor.Pirpi activity. Indicators of compromise have been published, including domain/URLs and host-based IoCs with SHA256 hashes."
