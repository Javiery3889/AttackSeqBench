        "Reconnaissance": "The Carbanak group conducted reconnaissance by collecting data related to banking applications and internal procedures after business hours or on weekends to avoid detection. This information was prepared for exfiltration to be used in the final stage of the attack.",
        "Initial Access": "The initial compromise involved spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents designed to download a Cobalt Strike beacon component. Victims were tricked into opening these attachments, which used exploits for Remote Code Execution in Microsoft Word (CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2017-11882, and CVE-2018-0802).",
        "Execution": "After the initial compromise, the adversary had the ability to download and execute new payloads, run shell commands to move laterally in the infrastructure, and delete files from the system to leave fewer forensic traces.",
        "Persistence": "The attackers established persistence in the infrastructure using a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.",
        "Privilege Escalation": "The attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials to move across the entire infrastructure, compromising a Domain Administrator account and using it throughout the duration of the attack.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Carbanak group minimized detection opportunities by performing operations outside business hours, limiting interaction to a handful of systems, and using single workstations as a hub for centralizing collected information and communication with their C&C server.",
        "Credential Access": "The attackers compromised credentials for a Domain Administrator and used them to compromise at least two more endpoints by the end of the first day.",
        "Discovery": "The attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network, collecting administrative level credentials and compromising additional network endpoints.",
        "Lateral Movement": "The attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations in search of critical information and targeting internal hosts and servers that would be used during the actual heist.",
        "Collection": "The attackers collected and prepared a series of potentially valuable documents pertaining to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.",
        "Command and Control": "The Cobalt Strike beacon was used for command and control, allowing the attackers to communicate with compromised systems and check for new commands to be executed.",
        "Exfiltration": "The attackers prepared documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration, which were relevant to the internal applications.",
        "Others": "The Carbanak group impersonated high-profile organizations in their spear-phishing campaigns, such as IBM, European Central Bank, and cybersecurity companies. The group's leader was apprehended in Spain on March 26th, 2018, but the group remained active with subsequent campaigns reported until May 2018.
