        "Initial Access": "The 'Red October' campaign, identified as 'Rocra', has been active for at least five years, targeting diplomatic and governmental agencies worldwide. The attackers used spear phishing with documents containing exploits for known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2010-3333, and CVE-2012-0158 to gain initial access. The earliest attacks with the MS Excel exploit occurred in 2010 and 2011, while the MS Word exploits were used in the summer of 2012. The spear phishing documents were customized for the victims, with the executable replaced by the attackers' own code.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The Rocra attackers created a multi-functional framework capable of quick feature extension for intelligence gathering. The system is resistant to C&C server takeover and allows recovery access to infected machines using alternative communication channels. The attackers deployed a module during lateral movement to actively scan the local area network, find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067, or accessible with admin credentials from their password database.",
        "Lateral Movement": "During lateral movement in a victim's network, the Rocra attackers deployed a module to actively scan the local area network, find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067, or accessible with admin credentials from their password database. Another module used collected information to infect remote hosts in the same network.",
        "Command and Control": "The Rocra campaign's C&C infrastructure is a chain of servers working as proxies to hide the true command and control server. The attackers created more than 60 domain names and several server hosting locations in different countries, mainly Germany and Russia, to control the network of infected machines. The C&C infrastructure's complexity rivals that of the Flame malware.",
        "Others": "The Rocra campaign has been active for at least five years, infiltrating networks at diplomatic, governmental, and scientific research organizations. The attackers have Russian-speaking origins and have created a sophisticated multi-functional framework for intelligence gathering. The malware targets not only workstations but also mobile devices and network equipment. The attackers have used at least three different exploits for previously known vulnerabilities and have a high degree of interaction with the victims' networks. Kaspersky Lab has identified several hundred infections worldwide, with the majority in Eastern Europe, North America, and Western European countries. The campaign has infected hundreds of victims in eight main categories, including government, diplomatic, research institutions, and military. The attackers' malware modules have been created by Russian-speaking operatives and have not been used in any other operations. Kaspersky Lab, in collaboration with international organizations, is continuing its investigation and providing resources for remediation and mitigation."
