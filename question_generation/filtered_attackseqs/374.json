        "Reconnaissance": "The CTI report by Securelist authors Alexander Liskin, Anton Ivanov, and Andrey Kryukov, dated September 18, 2017, details a reconnaissance technique used in the Freakyshelly targeted attack. The attackers utilized spear phishing emails with OLE2 format attachments that contained no active content but had links to PHP scripts on third-party web resources. When opened in Microsoft Word, the application sent a GET request to one of the links, thereby informing the attackers about the software installed on the victim's computer, including the Microsoft Office version.",
        "Initial Access": "The CTI report indicates that the initial access vector in the Freakyshelly targeted attack was through spear phishing emails. The emails contained OLE2 format documents with embedded links that, when opened in Microsoft Word, would send a GET request to the attacker's server.",
        "Defense Evasion": "The CTI report describes a defense evasion technique where the attackers used an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection. The documents attached to the spear phishing emails contained no macros, exploits, or any other active content, making them appear benign and bypassing security measures.",
        "Others": "The CTI report uncovers an undocumented feature in Microsoft Word that was abused by attackers. The feature involves the INCLUDEPICTURE field, which can contain a link to an image. However, in the attack, the link was in Unicode, causing Word to ignore it but still follow a URL attached to a form within the document. This URL was the actual link that Word followed when the document was opened, leading to the attackers' server. The report also notes that this feature is present in Microsoft Office for iOS and Android but not in LibreOffice or OpenOffice. Kaspersky Lab's security products can detect the use of this technique and find links embedded in documents using the same method."
