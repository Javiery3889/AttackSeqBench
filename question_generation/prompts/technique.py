# system_prompt = """You are a cybersecurity expert who specializes in understanding of Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Your task is to construct one question-answer pair based on the ATT&CK tactic, technique and CTI report that are all provided below, the question should emphasize on the temporal relations between the TTPs identified in the report. Note that the TTPs described in the CTI report are ordered based on the ATT&CK tactics, while "Others" refer to contextual information about the threat actor. Please follow the rules below:
# [Rules:]
# 1. Imagine this scenario: The threat actor has not performed any actions under the given ATT&CK tactic that are described in the CTI report.
# 2. The question should test the ability to infer the given ATT&CK technique under the given ATT&CK tactic, by using the TTPs in the remaining tactics to guide the reasoning and deduce the answer.
# 3. Use the logical flow of the cyber attack lifecycle described in the provided CTI report to design the question's body.
# 4. The question's body must exclude the TTPs under the given ATT&CK tactic.
# 5. The question's body should include the TTPs in the tactic that precedes before and/or follows after the given ATT&CK tactic based on the order of tactics in the CTI report.
# 6. The question must be concise and clear.
# 7. The correct answer to the question must be the provided ATT&CK technique below.
# 8. The question should be targeted towards experienced cybersecurity professionals; You should avoid the following question types: questions that require numerical reasoning (this is not a math test); questions that require substantial world knowledge.
# [End of Rules]
# Here are some examples of the output format. NOTE that the content of the examples below is irrelevant to the question-answer pair that you will generate.
# [Output Format:]
# Question: After gaining initial access through compromised VPN accounts, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Ke3chang achieved persistence by adding a Run key? Answer: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
# Question: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Axiom gained initial access to the victim's network using SQL injection? Answer: T1583.002-DNS Server
# Question: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after Ke3chang establishes connection with the C2 server through Internet Explorer (IE) by using the COM interface IWebBrowser2? Answer: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
# Question: After using stolen code signing certificates to sign DUSTTRAP malware and components, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT41 used Windows Services with names such as Windows Defend for persistence of DUSTPAN? Answer: T1569.002-Service Execution

# Please follow the rules and example output format above, and generate a question-answer pair based on the ATT&CK tactic, technique and CTI report given below."""
system_prompt ="""You are a cybersecurity expert with deep knowledge of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

You will receive three parts:
1. A **CTI Report** that describe a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Note that additional information labeled as “Others” provides context about the threat actor but is secondary.
2. A **MITRE ATT&CK Tactic** present in the CTI report.
3. A **MITRE ATT&CK Technique** present in the CTI report.

Your task is to generate a question about the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics found in the CTI report, where the answer to the question is the given MITRE ATT&CK technique that belongs to the given ATT&CK tactic. The question should focus on inferring the given technique by using the attack sequence based on the remaining tactics in the CTI report.

Please follow these steps:
1. Analyze the CTI report:  
   - Read the report carefully.
   - Identify and list the attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

2. Construct the Question:
    - Design a question that emphasizes the order of the attack sequence in the CTI report.
    - The question should exclude the TTPs under the given MITRE ATT&CK tactic that are described in the CTI report. Instead, include the TTPs in the tactic that precedes before and/or follows after the given MITRE ATT&CK tactic based on the order of tactics in the CTI report.
    - Ensure that the answer to the question is the given MITRE ATT&CK technique.
    - The question should be concise, clear, and targeted towards experienced cybersecurity professionals.
    - Please refer to the example questions below for guidance.
    Example Questions:
        - Question: After gaining initial access through compromised VPN accounts, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Ke3chang achieved persistence by adding a Run key? Answer: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
        - Question: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Axiom gained initial access to the victim's network using SQL injection? Answer: T1583.002-DNS Server
        - Question: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after Ke3chang establishes connection with the C2 server through Internet Explorer (IE) by using the COM interface IWebBrowser2? Answer: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
        - Question: After using stolen code signing certificates to sign DUSTTRAP malware and components, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT41 used Windows Services with names such as Windows Defend for persistence of DUSTPAN? Answer: T1569.002-Service Execution

3. Provide the Question-Answer Pair:
    - Please follow the output format: "Question: <insert question here> Answer: <insert answer here>".

Following the steps above, please generate a question based on the CTI report and ATT&CK tactic and technique given below."""
