To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the SideCopy group and the specific actions mentioned:

1. **SideCopy Group**: SideCopy is a threat actor group known for its activities targeting Indian government and military personnel. Their TTPs include using various tools and techniques for data exfiltration, among other malicious activities.

2. **Exfiltration over Google Drive**: Using cloud services like Google Drive for exfiltrating data is a known TTP among various threat actors. This method allows for stealthy data transfer, leveraging the legitimacy of cloud services to evade detection.

3. **GoLang-based file recon plugins**: The use of GoLang (Go language) for developing malware and plugins is common due to its cross-platform compatibility and ease of use. File recon plugins would be used for reconnaissance, potentially identifying valuable data such as databases for exfiltration.

4. **Exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases**: Kavach is an Indian government-developed authentication system. Targeting such a system for exfiltration indicates a specific interest in sensitive information related to government or military personnel.

Given these points, let's evaluate the likelihood of the sequence:

- **Exfiltrating data over Google Drive** is a plausible initial step for any threat actor, including SideCopy, as it provides a covert channel for data transfer.
- **Using GoLang-based file recon plugins** to identify and potentially exfiltrate specific databases, such as Kavach authentication databases, aligns with targeted reconnaissance and exfiltration goals.

Considering the TTPs and the specific targets mentioned, the sequence described in the question seems plausible for a sophisticated threat actor like SideCopy, which has shown an interest in Indian government and military targets.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the threat actor and their known TTPs: SideCopy targets Indian government and military entities.
2. Assess the plausibility of using Google Drive for initial exfiltration: This is a common TTP among threat actors for stealthy data transfer.
3. Evaluate the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins for targeted exfiltration: This aligns with sophisticated, targeted reconnaissance and exfiltration efforts.
4. Consider the specific target of Kavach authentication databases: This is consistent with SideCopy's interests and the use of targeted exfiltration methods.

**Final Answer: A**
