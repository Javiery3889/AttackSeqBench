To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the group "Charming Kitten," which is known for its sophisticated cyber espionage operations.

1. **Reconnaissance through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages**: This initial step involves gathering sensitive information such as phone numbers that could be used for password recovery and two-factor authentication. This is a common TTP used by various threat actors to gather preliminary information about their targets.

2. **Gathering sensitive information**: The goal here is to collect specific data that can facilitate further attacks, such as credential theft or bypassing security measures like two-factor authentication.

3. **Credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks**: This step involves using the gathered information to launch targeted phishing attacks aimed at stealing credentials. This is a direct method to gain initial access to the target's systems or accounts.

4. **Acquiring infrastructures by developing phishing sites**: After gaining initial access, the development of phishing sites could be a method to expand their reach, either by using the compromised infrastructure to host these sites or by using the gained access to manipulate existing web applications for phishing purposes.

Given this sequence, the question essentially asks if it's plausible that Charming Kitten would first gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks and then use the compromised systems or information to develop or leverage phishing sites as part of their operation to acquire more infrastructure or expand their attack scope.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Initial Access**: The group starts by gathering information and then uses spear-phishing for initial access, which aligns with known TTPs of sophisticated threat actors.
- **Expansion and Persistence**: After gaining access, developing phishing sites could be a logical next step to either expand their control, gather more credentials, or use the compromised infrastructure for further malicious activities.
- **Tactical Consistency**: This sequence is consistent with the tactics of groups like Charming Kitten, who are known for their sophisticated and multi-step attack strategies.

**Final Answer**: A
