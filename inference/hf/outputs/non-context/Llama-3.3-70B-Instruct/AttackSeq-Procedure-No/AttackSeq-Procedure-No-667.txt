To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence.

1. **Defense Evasion**: The actors start by uploading the Dumpert tool to evade antivirus and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. This is a common technique used by attackers to remain undetected within a network.

2. **Lateral Movement**: The question then mentions moving laterally to other systems on the network. Lateral movement is a tactic where attackers move from system to system to gain greater access and control within the network. The tool mentioned for this purpose is Impacket's atexec tool, which can be used to execute commands on remote systems.

3. **Credential Access**: Finally, the question mentions performing OS credential dumping using Mimikatz. Mimikatz is a well-known tool for extracting credentials from operating systems, which aligns with the tactic of gaining credential access.

Given this sequence:
- **Defense Evasion** is a preliminary step to avoid detection.
- **Lateral Movement** using Impacket's atexec tool is plausible as it allows attackers to move through the network without being detected, assuming they have the necessary credentials or exploits.
- **Credential Access** through Mimikatz is a logical next step after lateral movement, as attackers often seek to gain more credentials to further their access and control within the network.

However, the question asks if it is likely that actors will move laterally using atexec **only** before performing OS credential dumping. The use of "only" suggests an exclusivity that might not fully align with typical attack patterns, as attackers often use multiple tools and techniques for lateral movement and may interleave different tactics. Nonetheless, the sequence described (defense evasion, lateral movement, and then credential access) is a common and logical progression in an attack.

Considering the typical flow of an attack and the tools mentioned, the sequence described is plausible. However, the emphasis on "only" using atexec for lateral movement might oversimplify the complexity of real-world attacks, where multiple tools and techniques are often employed.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Identify the sequence: Defense Evasion -> Lateral Movement -> Credential Access.
2. Evaluate the tools: Dumpert for defense evasion, Impacket's atexec for lateral movement, and Mimikatz for credential access. All are plausible choices for their respective tactics.
3. Consider the logical flow: The sequence makes sense in the context of a cyber attack, where evading defenses, moving laterally, and then accessing credentials are common steps.

**Final Answer: A**
