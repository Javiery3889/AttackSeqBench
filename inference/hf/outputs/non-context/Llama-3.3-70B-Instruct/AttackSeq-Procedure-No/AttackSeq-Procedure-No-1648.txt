To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document. This document has an auto-open VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro. The use of VBA macros in Office documents is a common technique for gaining initial access to a system, as it can execute malicious code when the document is opened.

2. **Execution**: The VBA macro is used to execute queries to gather system information. This is a plausible step following initial access, as attackers often seek to understand the environment they have compromised to plan their next steps. Using a COM (Component Object Model) object to execute these queries is technically feasible and aligns with the execution tactic, specifically technique T1204 (User Execution) or potentially T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), depending on how the queries are executed.

3. **Discovery**: Gathering system information is part of the discovery tactic, where attackers seek to learn more about the system and network. This can involve executing system commands or scripts to gather information about running processes, network connections, or system configuration.

4. **Persistence**: The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours. 'mshta.exe' is a legitimate Windows utility that can be used to execute HTML applications. However, it can also be abused by attackers to download and execute malicious scripts from a URL, which aligns with technique T1192 (Spearphishing Link) for initial access in some cases, but here it's used for persistence. Creating a scheduled task is a method of achieving persistence (technique T1053, Scheduled Task/Job), allowing the malware to survive system reboots and maintain access.

Given this breakdown, the sequence described in the question is technically plausible and aligns with known TTPs used by attackers:

- **Initial Access** through phishing and malicious documents.
- **Execution** of malicious code (VBA macro) to gather system information.
- **Persistence** through scheduled tasks.

Therefore, it is likely that the VBA macro would use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information before the malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.
