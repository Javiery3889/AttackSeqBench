To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) typically used by adversaries, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Collection of Information**: The app is collecting sensitive information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data from the iOS device. This action aligns with the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gathering information that can be used for future operations.

2. **Performing Routines on the Device**: This could imply the execution of malicious code or scripts to further compromise the device or prepare it for exfiltration of data. This step could fall under the "Execution" tactic, where an adversary runs malicious code on a compromised system.

3. **Use of Encryption for C2 Channel**: The use of encryption for Command and Control (C2) channels is a common technique (T1043: Commonly Used Port, or more specifically, T1573: Encrypted Channel) used by adversaries to hide their communications with compromised systems. Encryption makes it difficult for defenders to detect and intercept the communication between the compromised device and the command and control server.

4. **Uploading Files via FTP Protocol**: This action involves the "Exfiltration" tactic, where an adversary transfers data from a compromised system to an external system or location under their control. Using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for this purpose is a technique (T1041: Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel, or more specifically, T1567: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol) that, while not the most secure, can be used for data exfiltration.

Given these steps, the question is whether it is likely for the app to use encryption for its C2 channel before uploading files via FTP protocol. 

- **Encryption** is a common method used by adversaries to protect their C2 communications, making it harder for defenders to detect and intercept these communications.
- **FTP**, being a clear-text protocol, does not inherently provide encryption. However, the question is about the encryption of the C2 channel, not the encryption of the FTP protocol itself.

Considering the typical TTPs used by adversaries to maintain stealth and ensure the integrity of their operations, it is plausible that an adversary would use encryption for their C2 channel to avoid detection, even if the subsequent step of uploading files via FTP does not inherently include encryption.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The app collects sensitive information, indicating a collection tactic.
2. It performs routines, suggesting execution tactics.
3. The use of encryption for the C2 channel is a common technique to maintain stealth.
4. Uploading files via FTP is an exfiltration tactic, which might or might not be encrypted at the protocol level but benefits from an encrypted C2 channel for command and control.

**Final Answer: A**
