To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate their plausibility in the context of a cyber attack.

1. **Initial Access via SocGholish**: SocGholish is a type of malware often distributed through phishing campaigns. It can be used to gain initial access to a system. The use of malicious JavaScript frameworks to deliver SocGholish aligns with common tactics used by attackers to compromise systems.

2. **Deployment of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell for Execution**: Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that can be used by attackers as a payload to establish a foothold within a network. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for executing commands and scripts, making it a common choice for deploying tools like Cobalt Strike. This step seems plausible as a method for establishing persistence and furthering the attack.

3. **Using Commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for Discovery**: These commands are typically used for reconnaissance and discovery within a compromised network. "whoami" is used to identify the current user, "net user" can list user accounts, and "net group" can list groups. These commands are basic yet effective for gathering information about the network and potential targets for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

Given the sequence:
- The attackers first gain initial access using SocGholish, which is a plausible entry point.
- Then, they deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell, which is a common method for post-exploitation and further network compromise.
- Finally, they use basic Windows commands for discovery, which aligns with typical reconnaissance activities following initial access.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Initial Access**: SocGholish via malicious JavaScript is a known method for gaining initial access.
2. **Execution**: Deploying Cobalt Strike with PowerShell is a common tactic for post-exploitation.
3. **Discovery**: Using "whoami", "net user", and "net group" commands for network reconnaissance is consistent with attacker behavior post-compromise.

**Conclusion**: The sequence of TTPs described in the question follows a logical and commonly observed pattern in cyber attacks. Therefore, it is plausible that attackers would follow this sequence.
