To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical cyber attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and relate them to the information provided about ProjectM actors.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions taken by ProjectM actors, including the development of a custom toolset, registration of domains (with or without WHOIS protection), and the use of spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks to gain initial access. The question asks whether, before gaining this initial access, it is likely that the actors identified network topologies.

2. **Understanding TTPs Involved**:
   - **Developing custom toolsets** and **registering domains** are preparatory steps that can be associated with the "Resource Development" phase, which precedes actual intrusion attempts.
   - **Spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks** are methods used for gaining "Initial Access" (TA0001 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework), indicating these are tactics used to initially breach a network.
   - **Identifying network topologies** can be related to the "Reconnaissance" phase (TA0043 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework), where attackers gather information about the target's network before attempting to access it.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - Given the context, identifying network topologies would logically precede the use of targeted methods like spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. This is because understanding the target's network layout can help attackers tailor their initial access attempts for higher success rates.
   - The development of custom toolsets and registration of domains are preparatory steps that can occur concurrently with or before reconnaissance activities, as these steps are about preparing the means to attack, not necessarily about gathering information on the target.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: ProjectM actors prepare for their campaign by developing custom tools and registering domains, indicating they are in the planning phase of their operation.
   - **Step 2**: Before launching targeted attacks like spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, it would be beneficial for the attackers to have some level of knowledge about their targets, including network topologies, to increase the effectiveness of their attacks.
   - **Step 3**: Given the targeted nature of spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, it is reasonable to assume that some form of reconnaissance, including identifying network topologies, would occur before these attacks to ensure they are as effective as possible.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical sequence of cyber attack operations and the specific details provided about ProjectM actors' activities, it is logical to conclude that identifying network topologies would indeed be a step that occurs before gaining initial access through targeted attacks.

Final Answer: A
