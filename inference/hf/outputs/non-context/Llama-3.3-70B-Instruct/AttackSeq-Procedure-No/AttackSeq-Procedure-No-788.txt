To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of such a sequence based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups like Higaisa.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs:
   - **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear-phishing, using malicious LNK files disguised as a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results. This is a common initial access vector for many APT groups, as it exploits human psychology to gain initial foothold.
   - **Execution and Persistence**: After the initial access, the question suggests the compromise of legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor. This implies a sophisticated level of access and control, potentially indicating an interest in long-term persistence within the target network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **APT Groups' TTPs**: APT groups, including Higaisa, are known for their sophisticated and evolving TTPs. They often use social engineering tactics (like spear-phishing) for initial access and then employ various techniques for persistence and execution, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in software or compromising updates.
   - **Compromising Legitimate Updates**: The compromise of legitimate software updates is a known TTP used by sophisticated threat actors. This method allows for a high degree of stealth and can provide widespread access, as users are more likely to trust updates from legitimate sources.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial vector of spear-phishing with malicious LNK files is plausible and aligns with known TTPs of APT groups.
   - **Step 2**: The compromise of legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor represents a sophisticated tactic that aligns with the goals of achieving persistence and further access within a target network.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the sophistication and goals of APT groups like Higaisa, and considering the described sequence of TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that such a sequence is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
