To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in evaluating the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) attributed to the MuddyWater APT group.

1. **Initial Access (Spear-phishing)**: The MuddyWater group initiated their campaign with spear-phishing attacks from February to April 2019. This is a common initial access technique used by many threat actors to gain an initial foothold into a target's network.

2. **Employment of server-based script (web.py)**: After gaining initial access, the use of a server-based script like web.py to process client requests and deliver next-stage payloads is a plausible next step. This would facilitate the group's ability to further compromise the network by distributing malware or tools necessary for deeper penetration and persistence.

3. **Utilization of a web control server and the infiltration tool muddyc3**: The subsequent use of a web control server and a specific infiltration tool like muddyc3 for command and control (C2) operations aligns with the tactics of establishing a stable, covert channel for issuing commands and exfiltrating data. This step would logically follow the delivery of next-stage payloads, as it enables the attackers to maintain control over compromised systems and achieve their objectives, such as data theft or disruption.

Given this sequence:
- **Initial Access** through spear-phishing,
- **Delivery** of next-stage payloads using a server-based script (web.py),
- **Command and Control** operations via a web control server and muddyc3,

The described sequence of TTPs forms a coherent and logical progression of an attack. The initial access phase is followed by the deployment of tools necessary for further compromise and persistence, culminating in the establishment of command and control channels for directing the attack and achieving the attackers' goals.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access via spear-phishing is a known and effective method used by APT groups.
2. The use of a server-based script for delivering next-stage payloads is consistent with tactics used to expand access and establish a foothold.
3. The employment of a web control server and a specific tool like muddyc3 for C2 operations is a logical step for maintaining access and controlling compromised systems.

**Final Answer: A**
