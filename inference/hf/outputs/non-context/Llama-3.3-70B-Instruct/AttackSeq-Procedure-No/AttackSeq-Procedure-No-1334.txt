To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question involves the OceanLotus Group, a known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, and their potential use of specific TTPs. The sequence mentioned involves:
   - Using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for command-and-control (C2) communication.
   - Performing lateral movement using stolen credentials.
   - Leveraging Windows built-in tools.

2. **Understanding the TTPs**:
   - **DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for C2**: This technique involves using the HTTPS protocol to encapsulate DNS messages, providing an additional layer of encryption and potentially making it harder for defenders to detect C2 communications.
   - **Lateral Movement using Stolen Credentials**: This involves moving through a network by using credentials that have been compromised, often to reach more sensitive areas or to spread malware.
   - **Leveraging Windows Built-in Tools**: This technique involves using tools that are native to the Windows operating system to carry out malicious activities, which can make detection more challenging since these tools are legitimate.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence**:
   - The use of DoH for C2 communication is a sophisticated method that can help evade detection. It's plausible that an advanced group like OceanLotus would use such a method to maintain stealth.
   - Following the establishment of a stealthy C2 channel, using stolen credentials for lateral movement is a common tactic among APT groups. This allows them to move undetected within a network.
   - Leveraging Windows built-in tools for malicious purposes is also consistent with the tactics of sophisticated threat actors, as it reduces the likelihood of detection by traditional signature-based security tools.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the sophistication of the OceanLotus Group and the tactics described, it is indeed plausible that they would use DNS over HTTPS for command-and-control communication as a precursor to performing lateral movement with stolen credentials and then leveraging Windows built-in tools. This sequence aligns with the advanced and stealthy nature of their operations.
