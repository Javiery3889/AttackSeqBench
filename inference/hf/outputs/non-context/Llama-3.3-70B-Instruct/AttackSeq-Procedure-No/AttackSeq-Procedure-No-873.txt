To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events described and analyze the role of each component mentioned, such as the Dropper module, Stager module, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities.

1. **Dropper Module**: A Dropper is a type of malware designed to install additional malware components on a compromised system. The question mentions that a Dropper module has been downloaded and executed, which implies the initial stage of an attack where more malicious components are being introduced to the system.

2. **Stager Module**: A Stager is a component of malware that is responsible for setting the stage for the main payload. It often handles tasks such as downloading additional components, establishing communication with command and control (C2) servers, and preparing the environment for the final payload. The Stager's role can include notifying the attackers or the C2 server about the successful exploitation and readiness of the system for further malicious activities.

3. **Exploitation of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**: The question mentions the exploitation of a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities. Zero-day vulnerabilities are previously unknown vulnerabilities in software that can be exploited by attackers before a patch or fix is available. Exploiting such vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain initial access to a system without being detected by traditional security measures.

4. **Privilege Escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956**: After gaining initial access, attackers often seek to escalate their privileges to gain more control over the system. The mention of specific CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) indicates the use of known vulnerabilities to achieve this escalation. CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 are related to Windows vulnerabilities that could be used for privilege escalation.

Given this context, the question essentially asks whether the Stager module would notify of successful exploitation after the system has been compromised through zero-day vulnerabilities and privilege escalation has been achieved using the mentioned CVEs.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The Dropper module's execution leads to the introduction of more malware components, which could include the Stager.
- The exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows would allow attackers to gain initial access to the system.
- The use of CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 for privilege escalation indicates an attempt to gain higher privileges within the system.
- The Stager module, being responsible for setting the stage for further malicious activities, would logically notify the attackers or the C2 server after the system is successfully exploited and prepared for the main payload.

**Final Answer**: A
