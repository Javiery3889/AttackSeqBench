To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario.

1. **Initial Access via Phishing**: The initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This is a common TTP used by attackers to gain initial access to a system (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment).

2. **Execution of Encoded PowerShell Script**: The malicious Word document likely contains a macro that, when enabled, executes an encoded PowerShell script. This is a technique (T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter) often used to execute malicious code on a victim's system.

3. **Retrieval via VBS Macro**: The mention of retrieval via a VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) macro suggests another layer of scripting involved, possibly to decode or execute the PowerShell script. This could be part of the execution technique, leveraging scripting interpreters.

4. **Download of Ursnif and GandCrab Malware**: Finally, the scenario mentions the download of payloads associated with Ursnif (a banking Trojan) and GandCrab (a ransomware). This aligns with the technique of executing a malicious payload after gaining access (T1204 - User Execution).

Given this sequence:
- The initial phishing email with a malicious attachment is a plausible initial access vector.
- The execution of an encoded PowerShell script, potentially through a VBS macro, is a common method for executing malicious code.
- The download of additional malware payloads like Ursnif and GandCrab after initial access is consistent with post-compromise TTPs aimed at establishing persistence, escalating privileges, or achieving the attacker's objectives (e.g., financial gain through banking trojans or ransom demands).

Considering these points, the sequence described in the question is technically plausible and aligns with known attack patterns. Therefore, it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script would execute as part of the attack sequence described, leading to the download of additional malware payloads.
