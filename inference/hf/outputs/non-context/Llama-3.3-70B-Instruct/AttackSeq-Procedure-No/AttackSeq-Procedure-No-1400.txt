To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned, relating them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the behavior of FIN13, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.

1. **Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives**: This action aligns with the "Data Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Data from Network Shared Drive" (T1025).

2. **Archiving it locally or remotely using utilities and libraries**: This step can be associated with "Data Staging" (T1074), where an adversary stages data in a location that can be accessed, often for exfiltration.

3. **Using DNS Calculation techniques for command and control (C2)**: This technique falls under "Application Window Discovery" or more specifically, "Domain Name System (DNS) calculation for C2 communication" isn't directly listed but can be related to "Application Layer Protocol" (T1071) for C2 communication, showing creativity in evading detection.

4. **Exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools**: This is clearly "Data Exfiltration" (TA0010), using "Web Service" (T1567) as the exfiltration method, potentially leveraging "Web Shell" (T1100) for establishing a persistent backdoor.

Given these steps, the question essentially asks if FIN13, after collecting and staging data, would use a specific DNS calculation technique for C2 communication before exfiltrating the data via web services.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

- **FIN13's TTPs**: FIN13 is known for sophisticated operations, including data collection, staging, and exfiltration. Their use of custom tools and evasion techniques is well-documented.
  
- **DNS Calculation for C2**: While specific techniques can vary, using DNS for C2 communication is a known method for evading detection. The described calculation method is a form of obfuscation.

- **Exfiltration via Web Services**: FIN13's use of web services for data exfiltration aligns with known TTPs, including leveraging web shells for persistence and data transfer.

- **Plausibility**: Given FIN13's sophistication and the described sequence of actions, it's plausible they would use creative C2 techniques, including DNS calculations, to manage their operations stealthily.

**Final Answer: A**
