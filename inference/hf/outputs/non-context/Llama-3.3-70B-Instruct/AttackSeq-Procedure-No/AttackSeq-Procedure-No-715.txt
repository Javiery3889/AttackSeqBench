To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Employing Living off the Land (LotL) tactics**: This involves using existing tools and software on the compromised system to carry out malicious activities, making it harder to detect the attack since no new, potentially suspicious software is introduced.

2. **Evading detection and removing tools from victim machines**: This step indicates an attempt to cover tracks and avoid being detected by security measures, further aligning with the use of LotL tactics.

3. **Using tools such as WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks**: This involves utilizing built-in Windows functionalities to schedule tasks, which can be used to execute malicious scripts or commands at specific times or intervals, again leveraging existing system tools to blend in.

4. **Initiating their attack by exploiting the Microsoft Office DDE protocol to execute commands in memory**: The Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol in Microsoft Office can be exploited to execute commands directly in memory without writing any files to disk, which is a stealthy approach to initial access.

Given these points, let's evaluate the sequence:

- The initial exploitation via the Microsoft Office DDE protocol allows for in-memory execution, which is a stealthy way to gain initial access.
- Following this, using LotL tactics (including tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling tasks) aligns with attempting to maintain access and execute further commands without introducing new software that might be detected.
- The use of WindowsRoamingToolsTask after initiating the attack makes sense as it would be part of the post-exploitation phase, where the attacker is looking to establish persistence and possibly move laterally within the network, all while trying to remain undetected.

Therefore, the sequence described in the question seems plausible as it outlines a sophisticated attack strategy focusing on stealth and evasion techniques. The attacker first gains access through a relatively stealthy method (DDE protocol exploitation), then uses existing system tools to further their goals without introducing detectable malware.
