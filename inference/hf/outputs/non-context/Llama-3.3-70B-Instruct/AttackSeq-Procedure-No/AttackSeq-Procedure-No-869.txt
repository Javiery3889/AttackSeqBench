To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence of events based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware is used for scanning and staging data during the Collection phase of an attack. This phase is part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the "Collection" tactic, which involves gathering information that can be used for future operations.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned include:
   - Using malware for scanning and staging data.
   - Exfiltrating data to a primary C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - Utilization of a fallback C&C server for communications.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Primary C&C Server**: Adversaries often use C&C servers to communicate with compromised systems, issue commands, and exfiltrate data. Using commonly used ports for this communication could be a tactic to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Fallback C&C Server**: The use of a fallback C&C server is a common resilience tactic. If the primary C&C server is detected and taken down, a fallback server can take over, ensuring continued communication with the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware's initial use for scanning and staging data indicates the adversary is preparing for data exfiltration.
   - **Step 2**: The mention of a primary C&C server for data exfiltration over commonly used ports suggests an attempt to maintain stealth by mimicking legitimate traffic.
   - **Step 3**: The introduction of a fallback C&C server implies a level of sophistication and planning by the adversary to ensure continued control and communication if the primary server is compromised.

Given these considerations, the scenario where data is sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after a fallback C&C server becomes operational seems plausible as a strategy to ensure the continuity of command and control over the compromised system. This approach allows the adversary to maintain options for communication and data exfiltration, adapting to potential disruptions.

**Final Answer: A**
