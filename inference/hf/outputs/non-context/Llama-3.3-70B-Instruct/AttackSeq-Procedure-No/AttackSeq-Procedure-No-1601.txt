To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) attributed to the MuddyWater group, a known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, and evaluate the likelihood of their actions following the initial access.

1. **Initial Access**: MuddyWater is leveraging a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access. This is a known TTP for various threat actors, including MuddyWater, to compromise systems. The use of vulnerabilities in software, especially in widely used applications like Microsoft Office, is a common initial access vector.

2. **Command and Control (C2) Servers**: After gaining initial access, the next logical step for an attacker would be to establish a means of communicating with the compromised system. This is typically done through C2 servers. The location of these servers can vary and is often chosen based on the operational security considerations of the threat actor, including the desire to obscure their origins or to utilize infrastructure in regions with less stringent legal cooperation or cyber security measures.

3. **Geographical Location of C2 Servers**: The question specifies that the C2 servers are in Pakistan and China. While it's possible for threat actors to use infrastructure in these countries, the attribution of MuddyWater's activities and the specific use of C2 servers in these locations would depend on various factors, including the group's operational security practices, their desired level of anonymity, and the availability of suitable infrastructure.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after gaining initial access, MuddyWater would only utilize C2 servers in Pakistan and China. While it's plausible that they might use servers in these locations, stating that they would "only" use servers in these countries might be too restrictive. Threat actors often diversify their infrastructure to avoid detection and maintain operational flexibility.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that MuddyWater's use of C2 servers would not be limited to Pakistan and China after gaining initial access. This is more plausible as it acknowledges the diversity and adaptability of threat actors in using various infrastructures globally to host malicious code and communicate with compromised systems.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. MuddyWater gains initial access via a vulnerability.
2. The use of C2 servers is a logical next step for communication with compromised systems.
3. The geographical location of C2 servers can vary based on operational security considerations.
4. Threat actors often diversify their infrastructure for resilience and anonymity.

**Final Answer**: B
