To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) as described, relating them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by iOS malware during the Command and Control (C2) phase, which includes sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files. It then asks if, after these actions, the app is likely to collect specific types of information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) during the Discovery phase.

2. **Identifying TTPs and Phases**:
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase**: This phase involves establishing a communication channel between the compromised device and the attacker's C2 server. The actions described (sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files) are consistent with C2 activities, where the malware communicates with its C2 server to exfiltrate data or receive commands.
   - **Discovery Phase**: This phase involves the attacker or malware gathering information about the compromised system or network. Collecting information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data falls under the Discovery phase, as it involves gathering specific data about the victim's device and activities.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question essentially asks if, after engaging in C2 activities, the malware would then proceed to collect more specific types of data, which is a discovery activity.
   - In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, after establishing C2, an attacker might indeed use the established channel to issue commands that facilitate further discovery of the victim's device and data. This could include collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data to further understand the victim's environment and potentially identify additional targets or vulnerabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Establishment of C2**: The malware has already established communication with its C2 server, which is a prerequisite for issuing commands or exfiltrating data.
   - **Exfiltration and Command**: The actions of sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files indicate that the malware is capable of both sending and potentially receiving commands or data.
   - **Logical Progression to Discovery**: After establishing a means of communication and potentially exfiltrating initial data, the next logical step for an attacker would be to gather more specific information about the device and its user, which aligns with the Discovery phase activities mentioned.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the established C2 channel and the malware's capability to communicate with its server, it is plausible that the next step would involve collecting more specific data about the victim's device and activities, such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, as part of the Discovery phase.
