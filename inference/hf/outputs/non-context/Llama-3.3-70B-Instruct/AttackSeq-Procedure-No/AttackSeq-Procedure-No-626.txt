To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the CostaRicto Campaign, which establishes communication with Command and Control (C2) servers. This communication is achieved through protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The question then asks about the likelihood of the SombRAT backdoor exfiltrating data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - Establishing C2 communication using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - Potential data exfiltration by the SombRAT backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of protocol tunneling for C2 communication indicates a sophisticated approach to evade detection, utilizing standard protocols (DNS and HTTP) that are less likely to be blocked.
   - The question of whether data exfiltration would occur over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol involves considering the typical behaviors of malware like SombRAT and the tactics used by campaigns like CostaRicto.
   - HTTPS and SMTPS are secure protocols that can be used for data exfiltration, providing encryption that makes detection more challenging. Using these protocols for exfiltration aligns with the evasion techniques often employed by sophisticated threats.
   - The mention of a "non-C2 protocol" for exfiltration suggests a method that doesn’t directly involve the established C2 channels, potentially to avoid detection or to use existing network traffic patterns for cover.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Recognize that sophisticated malware campaigns often use multiple protocols for different stages of their operation to maximize stealth and flexibility.
   - **Step 2**: Understand that the initial use of DNS and HTTP for C2 communication doesn’t preclude the use of other protocols (like HTTPS or SMTPS) for data exfiltration, especially if those protocols offer better cover or are less monitored.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the nature of SombRAT as a backdoor and its likely capabilities, including the potential for flexible communication and data exfiltration methods.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the plausibility of using a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration, considering it as a tactic to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Given the sophistication of the CostaRicto Campaign and the capabilities of the SombRAT backdoor, it is plausible that data exfiltration could occur over HTTPS or SMTPS as part of an effort to use protocols that are both secure and less likely to be scrutinized closely. This approach aligns with the tactics of evading detection and using existing network protocols for malicious purposes.

**Final Answer: A**
