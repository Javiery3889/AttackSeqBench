To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in evaluating the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a specific behavior of the Korplug variant, focusing on its communication method with Command and Control (C&C) servers and its data collection activities. The key points are:
   - The use of a custom TCP-based protocol for communication.
   - An initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
   - The collection of data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The question essentially asks whether the Korplug variant follows a specific sequence of actions: establishing communication with C&C servers using a custom protocol (with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP) before it proceeds to collect data from various sources.
   - Answer choice A (Yes) affirms this sequence, suggesting that the initial communication setup is a precursor to the data collection activities.
   - Answer choice B (No) denies this sequence, implying either that the communication method is different, the initial handshake does not occur as described, or data collection happens without the described communication setup.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Understanding Korplug's Behavior**: Korplug is known for its ability to communicate with C&C servers and collect sensitive data from compromised systems. The use of custom protocols for C&C communication is a common tactic among malware variants to evade detection.
   - **Initial Handshake and Data Collection**: The initial handshake, especially over HTTPS or TCP, could be a method to establish a secure or covert channel for further communication. This step is plausible as a precursor to collecting data, as it would allow the malware to receive instructions or send initial system information back to the C&C servers.
   - **Custom TCP-Based Protocol**: The use of a custom TCP-based protocol for ongoing communication after the initial handshake is consistent with efforts to maintain stealth and ensure continuous command and control over the compromised system.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on common malware behaviors and the specifics of the Korplug variant's known activities, is that it would indeed communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol after an initial handshake, before proceeding to collect data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

**Final Answer: A**
