To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the Konni APT Group based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups and the specifics mentioned:

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the use of 'versioninfo.bat' for collecting information about the user's computer. This suggests an initial reconnaissance phase where the attackers are gathering system information, which is a common TTP (Technique) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under "Discovery" (e.g., T1018 - Remote System Discovery, T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery).

2. **Exfiltration Methods**: The question then asks about the likelihood of exfiltrating the collected data via a POST request before sending it through 'unactivate.vbs'. Data exfiltration is a key objective for many APT groups, including the Konni APT Group, and using HTTP/HTTPS (which could involve POST requests) for exfiltration is a common method due to its ability to blend in with normal network traffic (T1041 - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel).

3. **Role of 'unactivate.vbs'**: The mention of 'unactivate.vbs' suggests a potential script used for further malicious activities. Scripts like these can be used for various purposes, including executing commands, downloading additional payloads, or even exfiltrating data. However, without specific context on 'unactivate.vbs', its primary role in the sequence is speculative.

4. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests a direct exfiltration method using a POST request followed by an action involving 'unactivate.vbs'. Given the context, if 'unactivate.vbs' is part of the exfiltration or command and control (C2) process, this could be plausible. APT groups often use multiple stages and varied protocols for data exfiltration and C2 communication.
   - **Option B (No)**: This option denies the sequence of exfiltrating data via a POST request before involving 'unactivate.vbs'. Without specific details on the group's TTPs regarding 'unactivate.vbs', it's challenging to definitively rule out this sequence.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of 'versioninfo.bat' for reconnaissance aligns with known APT TTPs.
   - Exfiltration via HTTP/HTTPS (which could include POST requests) is a common method.
   - The role of 'unactivate.vbs' is less clear but could plausibly be involved in the exfiltration or C2 process.

6. **Final Evaluation**: Given the information and typical behaviors of APT groups, the most plausible sequence involves using collected data for further malicious activities, which could include exfiltration. The specific method (via a POST request) before involving 'unactivate.vbs' could be part of the group's tactics, especially if 'unactivate.vbs' plays a role in the exfiltration process or as part of the command and control channel.

**Final Answer: A**
