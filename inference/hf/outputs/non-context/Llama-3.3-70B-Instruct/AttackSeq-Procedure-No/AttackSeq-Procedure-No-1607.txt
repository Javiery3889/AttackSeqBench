To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the SideCopy group and the context provided:

1. **Understanding SideCopy's TTPs**: SideCopy is known for its sophisticated phishing campaigns and use of various malware tools to gain access to target systems. Their methods often involve social engineering tactics to trick victims into executing malicious files or clicking on links that lead to malware downloads.

2. **Initial Access (TA0001)**: According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, initial access involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. This can be achieved through various means, including phishing (e.g., spearphishing attachment, spearphishing link), exploiting a public-facing application, or using valid accounts.

3. **Execution of Malicious Files**: The use of malicious LNK files, HTA (HTML Application) files, and loader DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) are all techniques that can be used for execution (TA0002) after initial access has been gained. LNK files can be used to execute malicious commands or launch malware, HTA files can execute JavaScript or other code directly, and loader DLLs can load and execute additional malicious payloads.

4. **Sequence of TTPs**: Typically, an attacker would first need to establish initial access to a victim's system. This could be through phishing, where a victim clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious attachment (like a malicious LNK file). Once initial access is established, the attacker can then proceed to execute their malicious payloads, which could include HTAs and loader DLLs, to further their objectives within the compromised system.

Given this context, the question asks if SideCopy is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems. The logical sequence of events in a cyber attack suggests that initial access must be gained before any further malicious activities, such as the execution of malware or additional payloads, can occur.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Step 1**: Identify the need for initial access before any execution of malicious files.
- **Step 2**: Recognize that the execution of malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs are techniques used after gaining access to a system.
- **Step 3**: Conclude that the logical sequence involves initial access followed by the execution of malicious files.

**Final Answer**: A
