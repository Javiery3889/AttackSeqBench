To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: The initial access vector is a Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organization's website. This means the attackers have compromised the website to deliver malware or exploit vulnerabilities.

2. **Exploit Code for CVE-2014-0322**: The attackers are using exploit code for a known vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) to infect victims. This indicates an exploitation technique where the attackers leverage a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code on the victim's system.

3. **Infection with ZxShell Malware**: The exploit results in the infection of the victim's system with ZxShell malware. ZxShell is a type of remote access trojan (RAT) that allows attackers to control the infected system remotely.

4. **Use of Sakula Malware**: The question asks about the likelihood of using Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure before leveraging the exploit code.

Given this sequence, the question essentially asks if it's plausible that Sakula malware is used for C2 communication before the exploit code (for CVE-2014-0322) is used to infect the system with ZxShell malware.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Initial Compromise**: The attack starts with a strategic web compromise, indicating the attackers have control over the website to some extent.
- **Exploitation**: The use of exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 suggests a method to gain access to the victim's system, leading to the infection with ZxShell malware.
- **C2 Communication**: For Sakula malware to be used for C2 communication before the exploitation, it would imply that the attackers already have a foothold or a way to deliver Sakula before using the exploit code. However, the sequence provided suggests that the exploit code is the initial vector for infection (with ZxShell), not Sakula.

**Conclusion**: Given the provided sequence of events, it seems unlikely that Sakula malware would be used for C2 communication before the exploit code is leveraged to infect the system with ZxShell malware. The exploit code appears to be the initial method of compromise, leading to the infection, which would then enable C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B**
