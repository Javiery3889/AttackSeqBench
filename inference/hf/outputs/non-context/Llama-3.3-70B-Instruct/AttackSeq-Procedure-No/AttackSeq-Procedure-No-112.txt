To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical cyber attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to the discovery phase, lateral movement, and persistence, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Discovery Phase**: During this initial phase, attackers gather information about the target environment, including systems, users, and data. This phase is crucial for planning subsequent steps. Techniques used here might include Network Service Scanning (T1046), System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016), and Account Discovery (T1069), among others.

2. **Lateral Movement**: After gaining an understanding of the environment, attackers often seek to move laterally within the network to reach their objectives, which could be sensitive data, critical systems, or strategic locations for further exploitation. Lateral movement can be achieved through various means, including exploiting vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or leveraging existing trust relationships between systems. Tainting shared content (which could be considered under the technique of Spearphishing Attachment [T1193] or Drive-by Compromise [T1189] if the content is accessed through a compromised website) is a method to achieve lateral movement by compromising additional systems when the content is accessed or executed.

3. **Persistence**: Installing additional persistence points on new systems is a tactic used by attackers to maintain access to the compromised environment even if their initial entry point is discovered and remediated. Techniques for persistence include creating new user accounts (T1136), modifying existing accounts (T1098), or using scheduled tasks (T1053) to ensure continued access.

Given these steps, the question essentially asks if, after the discovery phase, it's plausible for attackers to use tainted shared content as a means of lateral movement before establishing additional persistence mechanisms on newly compromised systems.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Discovery** provides the necessary intelligence for planning.
- **Lateral Movement** through tainted shared content is a viable method to expand the attacker's foothold within the network.
- **Persistence** mechanisms are typically established after an attacker has gained access to a system to ensure continued access.

Considering the logical progression of a cyber attack, it is indeed plausible that after gaining knowledge of the target environment, attackers would attempt to move laterally to compromise more systems before focusing on establishing persistence on those new systems. This approach allows them to expand their access and then ensure they can maintain that access over time.

**Final Answer: A**
