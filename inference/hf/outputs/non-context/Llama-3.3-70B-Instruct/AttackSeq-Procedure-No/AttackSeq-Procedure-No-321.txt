To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence of events based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Analysis**: The question mentions an app uploading files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations. This indicates that the app is communicating with a C2 server, which is a common technique used by attackers to control compromised devices remotely (T1043: Commonly Used Port). FTP is used for file transfer, suggesting the app is exfiltrating data or receiving commands/files from the C2 server.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**: After uploading files via FTP, the question asks if it's likely that the app would send gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device. This implies a sequence where:
   - The app communicates with the C2 server using FTP.
   - It then performs some actions on the iOS device (which could involve data collection, executing commands, etc.).
   - Finally, it sends the gathered information via HTTP.

3. **Evaluation of TTPs**:
   - **FTP for C2 and File Transfer**: Using FTP for initial communication and file transfer is plausible, especially if the attackers are looking for a straightforward method to exfiltrate data or transfer files to/from the compromised device.
   - **Performing Routines on the Device**: After establishing communication, performing routines could involve anything from data collection (T1005: Data from Local System) to preparing the environment for further exploitation.
   - **Sending Information via HTTP**: Finally, sending gathered information via HTTP (T1071: Application Layer Protocol) is a common method for data exfiltration due to its ubiquity and the fact that HTTP traffic is often less scrutinized than other protocols.

4. **Likelihood of the Sequence**:
   - Given the context, the sequence described is plausible. Attackers often use multiple protocols for different stages of their operation to evade detection and ensure reliable communication. Starting with FTP for initial setup or data transfer, followed by performing actions on the device, and then using HTTP for exfiltrating gathered data aligns with known TTPs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the described sequence of events is indeed plausible and aligns with common attacker TTPs. Therefore, it is likely that after uploading files via FTP, the app would send gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device.
