To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Ensuring Persistence**: The malware downloads a second-stage binary to the startup folder. This action is associated with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically technique T1204 (User Execution: Malicious Link) or T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application), depending on the initial infection vector, followed by T1060 (Persistence) for achieving persistence through startup folder placement.

2. **Collecting MAC Address**: Collecting the MAC address of an infected host falls under the "Discovery" tactic, specifically technique T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery), which involves gathering information about the network configuration of the compromised system. The MAC address is a unique identifier for network interfaces and can be used for various purposes, including identifying the system or tracking its movements within a network.

3. **Communicating with Control Servers using HTTP POST Requests**: This action is associated with the "Command and Control" (C2) tactic, specifically technique T1071 (Application Layer Protocol), where HTTP (and potentially HTTPS) is used as a protocol for communication between the malware and its command and control servers. The use of HTTP POST requests is a common method for sending data back to the C2 servers.

Given the sequence of actions:
- The malware has already established persistence, indicating it has a foothold on the system.
- Collecting the MAC address as part of discovery activities makes sense as it would provide valuable information about the infected host to the attackers, aiding in further exploitation or in distinguishing between compromised hosts.
- Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests is a plausible next step after gathering information, as the malware would need to send back the collected data (including the MAC address) to the command and control servers for further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of a malware's lifecycle from establishing persistence, to gathering system information, and then communicating back to its operators, it is reasonable to conclude that the Rising Sun implant would indeed collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers.
