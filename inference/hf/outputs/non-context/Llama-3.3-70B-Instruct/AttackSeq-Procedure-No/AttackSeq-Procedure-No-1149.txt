To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events described and analyze them in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware like Raccoon stealer.

1. **Initial Analysis**: The question describes a scenario involving Raccoon stealer, a type of malware known for stealing sensitive information such as system and account information, as well as crypto wallet data. The scenario mentions communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers via Telegram, which is an unusual but not unheard-of method for C&C communication, offering a degree of stealth and evasion.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Command and Control**: The malware uses Telegram for C&C communication. This is a technique under the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically using application layer protocols for C2 (T1071).
   - **Execution**: The malware collects system, account, and crypto wallet data. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic but more specifically falls under "Collection" (T1005 for Credential Collection, and potentially T1056 for Input Capture for collecting other sensitive data).
   - **Defense Evasion**: The malware makes network requests to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers to bypass blocking. This is a technique under the "Defense Evasion" tactic, specifically using encrypted channel (T1573) or possibly domain generation algorithms if the addresses are dynamically generated.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The question essentially asks if it's plausible that Raccoon stealer collects sensitive data through the Execution phase before ensuring Defense Evasion by obtaining new C&C server addresses via Telegram.
   - Given the nature of Raccoon stealer and similar malware, it's entirely plausible that after establishing C&C communication, the malware would proceed to collect sensitive data (Execution/Collection phase).
   - The act of collecting data would logically precede or occur concurrently with efforts to maintain C&C communication and evade defenses, as the malware needs to ensure it can exfiltrate the collected data and receive further commands.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the described sequence and the typical behavior of malware like Raccoon stealer, it is indeed likely that the malware would collect system, account, and crypto wallet data as part of its execution and collection phases before or while ensuring its ability to communicate with C&C servers and evade defenses.
