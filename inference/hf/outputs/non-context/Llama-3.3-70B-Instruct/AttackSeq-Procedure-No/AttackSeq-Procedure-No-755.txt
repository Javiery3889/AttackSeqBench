To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the Rising Sun implant communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control (C2) purposes. This indicates that the implant has already established a foothold within the target network and is now in the phase of communicating with its command and control servers to receive further instructions or send back stolen data. The question then asks if it is likely that the implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information after this communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - Establishing communication with C2 servers (via HTTP POST requests).
   - The implied action of performing initial reconnaissance, which would involve collecting network and system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests that after establishing C2 communication, the implant would likely perform initial reconnaissance. This is plausible because, in many attack sequences, after an implant establishes communication with its C2 servers, it would indeed collect information about the network and system it has compromised. This information is crucial for the attackers to understand the environment, identify potential targets or valuable data, and plan their next steps, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - **Option B (No)**: This option suggests that performing initial reconnaissance after establishing C2 communication is unlikely. However, given the typical goals of malware and implants (which include gathering intelligence about the compromised system and network), this option seems less likely to be correct in the context of a typical attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Rising Sun implant's communication with control servers indicates an active and established foothold.
   - Typical malware behavior after establishing C2 includes gathering more information about the compromised environment to inform further malicious activities.
   - Collecting network and system information is a common step in the reconnaissance phase, which often follows initial compromise and C2 establishment.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the typical sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks and the behaviors associated with implants and malware, it is reasonable to conclude that after communicating with its C2 servers, the Rising Sun implant would likely engage in activities such as collecting network and system information as part of its reconnaissance efforts.

Final Answer: A
