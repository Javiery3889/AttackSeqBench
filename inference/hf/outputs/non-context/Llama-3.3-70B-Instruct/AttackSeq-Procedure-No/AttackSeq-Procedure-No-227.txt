To address this question, let's break down the sequence of events described and analyze the plausibility of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks.

1. **Initial Infection Vector**: The use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads is a known TTP. This technique is often used in phishing campaigns where a malicious document is sent to victims. Upon opening the document, the macros execute, leading to the download of additional malware components. This aligns with the initial steps of many cyber attacks, where the goal is to establish a foothold on the victim's system.

2. **Dropping a File**: The action of dropping a file named 'nanagrams.exe' into the system's temporary directory suggests the introduction of a malicious executable. This executable could serve various purposes, such as establishing persistence, gathering information, or downloading additional malware. The specific name 'nanagrams.exe' might be an attempt to disguise the malware as a legitimate file or application.

3. **JavaScript Downloader**: The mention of a JavaScript downloader indicates that the attackers are using JavaScript to download files from a specified URL. This is a common technique used in drive-by downloads or in the context of malware that needs to update itself or download additional components.

4. **Revealing Source Code**: The scenario mentions 'surprise.php' revealing its source code, showing visitor tracking through an iframe. This part seems less directly related to the initial malware deployment and more related to web-based tracking or potential information gathering. If 'surprise.php' is part of the attacker's infrastructure, revealing its source code might not be a deliberate action by the attackers but rather a mistake or a result of the system being compromised.

Given these points, the question essentially asks if it's plausible that a JavaScript downloader drops a specific executable before a PHP script (potentially used for tracking) reveals its source code.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The initial use of VBA macros and JavaScript for dropping files is a plausible attack vector.
- The dropping of 'nanagrams.exe' aligns with common malware deployment tactics.
- The involvement of a JavaScript downloader to fetch files from a URL is consistent with how malware often updates or expands its capabilities.
- The revelation of 'surprise.php's source code seems unrelated to the direct actions of the malware but could indicate a broader campaign involving web-based components.

**Conclusion**: Considering the sequence of events, the most critical aspect is whether the actions described (dropping 'nanagrams.exe' and the involvement of 'surprise.php') are likely to occur in the described order as part of a coherent attack sequence. The actions of dropping malware and using JavaScript for downloading files are common. However, the specific timing and relation to 'surprise.php' revealing its source code might not be directly connected to the primary goal of deploying malware.

**Final Answer: B**
