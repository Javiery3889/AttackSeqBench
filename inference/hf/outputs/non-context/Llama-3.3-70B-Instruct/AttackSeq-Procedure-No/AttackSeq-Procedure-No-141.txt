To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical cyber attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to initial access and credential gathering.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability being used for initial access. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Initial Access" tactic, specifically the "Exploit Public-Facing Application" technique. This method involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems to gain access to a network.

2. **Credential Gathering**: After gaining initial access, attackers often seek to gather credentials to move laterally within the network, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence. The use of phishing domains to gather user credentials is a common technique under the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Phishing can be used at various stages of an attack, including before initial access (spear phishing for example) or after, to expand the attacker's foothold.

Given the sequence described:
- The attackers first gain initial access through an exploit.
- Then, the question posits the use of phishing domains to gather user credentials.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Exploit**: The attackers exploit an unpatched vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8 to gain initial access. This is a direct method of gaining access without necessarily needing credentials at this stage.
2. **Post-Exploitation**: After gaining access, the attackers might seek to expand their control, move laterally, or ensure persistence. Gathering credentials can facilitate these actions.
3. **Credential Gathering via Phishing**: Using phishing domains to gather credentials is plausible post-initial access. This could help attackers to obtain credentials for specific accounts that are not accessible or exploitable through the initial vulnerability.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes**, it is plausible that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials after performing the initial access. This aligns with common post-exploitation TTPs aimed at expanding access and control within a compromised network.
- **B: No**, this choice suggests that using phishing domains for credential gathering after initial access is unlikely, which contradicts common practices observed in cyber attacks where attackers often seek to gather more credentials after gaining initial access.

**Final Answer**: A
