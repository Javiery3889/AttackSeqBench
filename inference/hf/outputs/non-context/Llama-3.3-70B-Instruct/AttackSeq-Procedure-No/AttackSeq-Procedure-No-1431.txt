To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware like Smooth Operator.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where data has been collected and exfiltrated using a HTTP GET request as part of a second-stage payload. It then asks if it's likely that the malware will establish communication with its Command and Control (C2) servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned or implied include:
   - Data Exfiltration (TA0010) using HTTP.
   - Potential use of Encrypted Channel (T1573) for C2 communication.
   - Use of Custom Encryption (T1606) or encoding for obfuscation.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Establishing Communication over HTTPS**: Malware often uses HTTPS for C2 communication because it provides an encrypted channel, making it harder for defenders to detect and intercept the communication. Given that the initial exfiltration used HTTP, switching to HTTPS for further communication aligns with common evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - **Use of Custom Data Encoding Algorithm**: Malware authors frequently use custom encoding or encryption algorithms to obfuscate their data. This makes it difficult for security tools to detect the communication as malicious, as the patterns do not match known encryption methods.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware has already demonstrated the capability to exfiltrate data, indicating an established communication channel with the C2 server.
   - **Step 2**: The use of HTTP for initial exfiltration might be a tactical choice for the initial stage, but for ongoing communication, especially if the malware intends to maintain a presence, using an encrypted channel like HTTPS is more secure and common.
   - **Step 3**: Employing a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation is consistent with efforts to evade detection, a primary goal of sophisticated malware.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and common TTPs observed in malware operations, it is plausible that the Smooth Operator malware would establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS to leverage encryption for stealth and use a custom data encoding algorithm to further obfuscate its communications.
