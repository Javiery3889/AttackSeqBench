To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by FamousSparrow, which includes:
   - Dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz. This action is associated with **Credential Access (TA0006)**, specifically the technique "OS Credential Dumping (T1003)".
   - Collecting system information and probing files as part of the **Discovery (TA0007)** phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Credential Access (TA0006)** typically follows initial access and possibly some discovery to identify where credentials can be obtained. Using Mimikatz for credential dumping is a common technique after an attacker has gained access to a system.
   - **Discovery (TA0007)** involves gathering information about the system, network, and applications. This can include collecting system information and probing files, which are essential for understanding the environment, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and planning further actions.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question suggests that FamousSparrow is dumping credentials and then proceeding with discovery activities. However, in a typical attack sequence:
   - **Initial Access** is often followed by some level of **Discovery** to understand the environment.
   - **Credential Access** can be an early or mid-stage action, depending on the attacker's goals and the system's configuration, but it often follows or is concurrent with some discovery to identify where and how credentials can be accessed.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Initial access to a system is gained.
   - **Step 2**: Some level of discovery is typically conducted to understand the system and network layout.
   - **Step 3**: Based on the information gathered, an attacker might attempt to gain more credentials, possibly using tools like Mimikatz.
   - **Step 4**: Further discovery, including collecting system information and probing files, can occur after credential access to leverage the newly obtained credentials for deeper access or lateral movement.

Considering these steps, it seems less likely that an attacker would dump credentials without first conducting some level of discovery to identify potential targets for credential dumping. However, the question asks if it's likely that discovery activities (collecting system information and probing files) would occur **only after** credential dumping, which seems plausible as part of a broader campaign where initial discovery led to the identification of systems from which credentials could be dumped, and then further discovery is needed to exploit those credentials effectively.

**Final Answer: B**
