To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the plausibility of the described actions in relation to common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with victims opening malicious Microsoft Word documents that execute a macro. This is a common initial access technique (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment) where the macro downloads and installs the Pierogi backdoor. This step is plausible as macros in Office documents are a well-documented vector for initial access.

2. **Execution**: The macro executes to download and install the Pierogi backdoor. This aligns with the technique of executing a macro to download additional malicious components (T1204 - User Execution).

3. **Defense Evasion and Persistence**: The question then asks if the backdoor is likely to masquerade files by renaming one of its tools to a benign file name before achieving persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder. 
   - **Masquerading files** (T1036 - Masquerading) is a common defense evasion technique where attackers rename malicious files to appear as legitimate system files or applications, aiming to evade detection.
   - **Achieving persistence** by adding a shortcut to the startup folder (T1060 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) is also a well-documented technique. This ensures the malware (in this case, the Pierogi backdoor) runs every time the system boots up, maintaining access to the compromised system.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question aligns well with known TTPs used by adversaries:
- Initial access through spearphishing with a malicious attachment.
- Execution of the malicious payload through user interaction (opening the document and enabling macros).
- Defense evasion through masquerading to avoid detection.
- Persistence through modification of startup folders to ensure continued access.

Therefore, the described sequence of events is consistent with tactics and techniques commonly observed in cyber attacks, making it plausible that the backdoor would indeed attempt to masquerade its files and achieve persistence as described.
