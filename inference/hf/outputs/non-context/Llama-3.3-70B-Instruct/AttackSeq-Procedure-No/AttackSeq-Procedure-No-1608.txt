To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in determining the most plausible sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that an adversary like SideCopy might use, considering the context provided:

1. **Understanding SideCopy's Goals and TTPs**: SideCopy is known for its sophisticated attacks, often targeting high-value assets. Targeting a multi-factor authentication app like Kavach indicates an interest in gaining access to sensitive government systems or data. To achieve this, gaining initial access to the target network is crucial.

2. **Importance of MFA and Azure AD Services**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) apps like Kavach are designed to add an extra layer of security to the authentication process. Azure AD services, including ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services, play critical roles in managing identities and facilitating single sign-on (SSO) capabilities across different services. Gathering encryption keys from these services could potentially allow an attacker to bypass MFA or move laterally within a network.

3. **Establishing Initial Access**: The MITRE ATT&CK framework outlines various techniques for establishing initial access, including exploiting public-facing applications, spearphishing, or using valid accounts. However, if an attacker aims to bypass security controls like MFA, they might first seek to gather sensitive information such as encryption keys that could facilitate undetected access.

4. **Evaluating the Plausibility**: Given SideCopy's sophistication and the target (a government-used MFA app), it's reasonable to assume they would attempt to gather as much information as possible to ensure a successful breach. This includes potentially targeting Azure AD services to obtain encryption keys, which could be used to establish initial access or to move laterally within the network without being detected.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the typical TTPs of sophisticated threat actors like SideCopy, it is plausible that they would attempt to gather encryption keys from Azure AD services as part of their effort to establish initial access to victim systems before targeting the Kavach MFA app.
