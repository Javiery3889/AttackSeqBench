To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question involves understanding the behavior of malware, specifically PyFlash backdoor, and its communication methods with its Command and Control (C&C) server. It mentions the gathering of OS-related information and the potential use of HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography for communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Gathering OS-related information.
   - Sending the information to the C&C server.
   - Potential use of HTTPS for communication.
   - Involvement of Asymmetric Cryptography.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Use of HTTPS**: Malware often uses HTTPS for communication due to its encrypted nature, which makes it harder to detect. This aligns with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware to evade detection.
   - **Asymmetric Cryptography**: This is a method used for secure communication, where a pair of keys (public and private) is used. It's plausible for malware to use such cryptographic methods to securely communicate with C&C servers without being intercepted.
   - **PyFlash and NetFlash**: While specific details about these are not provided, the question implies they are involved in the communication process with C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Malware often uses encrypted channels for communication to avoid detection.
   - HTTPS is a common protocol used for encrypted communication on the internet.
   - Asymmetric Cryptography provides a secure method for encrypting and decrypting messages, suitable for C&C communication.
   - Given that PyFlash has already demonstrated the capability to gather and send information, using a secure method like HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography for further communication is plausible and aligns with common malware TTPs.

5. **Final Answer**: Considering the above points, it is reasonable to conclude that PyFlash and potentially NetFlash could use HTTPS for communicating with their C&C servers, utilizing Asymmetric Cryptography for security. This method would help in evading detection and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the communication.

Final Answer: A
