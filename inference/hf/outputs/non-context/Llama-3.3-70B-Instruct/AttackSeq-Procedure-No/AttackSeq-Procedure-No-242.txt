To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) typically observed in such scenarios, keeping in mind the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **System Information Discovery**: This is a technique (T1018) where an adversary gathers information about the system they are currently operating on or are targeting. This can include details such as the operating system, hardware, software, and configuration. The goal is often to understand the environment to plan further actions.

2. **Returning Results to C&C Server**: After gathering system information, sending it back to the Command and Control (C&C) server (T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) allows the attackers to analyze the data and decide on the next steps. This could include determining if the compromised system is of interest, deciding which additional tools to deploy, or planning lateral movement within the network.

3. **Using a Network Sniffer Module**: Deploying a network sniffer (T1040 - Network Sniffing) is a technique used to capture and analyze network traffic. This can be done to discover sensitive information such as user credentials being transmitted over the network, especially if they are not encrypted.

4. **Discovering User Credentials**: The primary goal of using a network sniffer in this context would be to intercept and capture user credentials (T1110 - Brute Force, but in this context, more aligned with T1114 - Email Collection or T1204 - User Execution for credential capture, though the direct technique for network sniffing for credentials isn't explicitly listed, it falls under network sniffing for sensitive data).

5. **Attempting Communication with C&C Infrastructure**: After gathering more information, including potentially sensitive credentials, the malware might attempt to communicate with its C&C infrastructure (T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, or more broadly under Command and Control). This could be to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or to use the compromised system as a pivot point for further attacks.

Given this sequence:
- The malware has already established communication with its C&C server to return system information.
- The next logical step, if the attackers are interested in deeper network exploitation or lateral movement, would indeed involve gathering more specific, sensitive information such as user credentials.
- Using a network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network aligns with the goal of gathering more sensitive information that could be used for further exploitation.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of attack techniques and the goals of each step, it is plausible that after executing system information discovery and returning the results, the malware would attempt to gather more sensitive information such as user credentials before or as part of further communication with its C&C infrastructure.
