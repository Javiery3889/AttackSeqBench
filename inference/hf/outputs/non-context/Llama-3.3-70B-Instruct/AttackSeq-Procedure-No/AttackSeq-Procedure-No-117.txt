To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with the exploitation of CVE-2017-9841, a vulnerability in PHPUnit, to gain initial access to the system. This aligns with the "Exploitation of Remote Services" technique under the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Persistence**: The Tuyul malware then downloads a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence. This action can be associated with the "Cron Job" technique under the "Persistence" tactic. Cron jobs are a common method for achieving persistence on Unix-like systems by scheduling tasks to run at regular intervals.

3. **Execution**: Finally, the malware executes Perl scripts and shell commands on the victim systems. This can be linked to the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique under the "Execution" tactic, where an adversary uses a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts.

Given this sequence of TTPs:
- **Exploitation** for initial access,
- **Downloading a script** for persistence, and
- **Executing scripts and commands** for further execution and potentially other tactics like discovery, privilege escalation, or exfiltration,

The sequence described in the question seems plausible and aligns with common attack patterns observed in the wild. The use of a cron job for persistence is a known tactic, and executing scripts and commands is a fundamental aspect of post-exploitation activities.

Therefore, considering the logical flow of an attack from initial access, through maintaining persistence, to executing malicious scripts and commands, the answer to whether it is likely that the Tuyul malware will periodically download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence before executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
