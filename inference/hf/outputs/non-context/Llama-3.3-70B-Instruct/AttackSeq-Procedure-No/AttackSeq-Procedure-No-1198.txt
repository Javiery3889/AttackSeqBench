To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the Lazarus Group, a well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and typical adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

1. **Achieving Persistence**: The initial step involves achieving persistence through dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder. This action is aimed at ensuring that the malicious code (in this case, a DLL) is executed every time the system starts up, maintaining the adversary's access to the compromised system. This technique aligns with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Executing a Malicious DLL via Windows Update Client**: This indicates the use of a legitimate system process (Windows Update Client) to execute malicious code, which is a technique known as "Masquerading" or "Hijacking" of a legitimate process. This falls under the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Enumerating AWS Storage Services**: The question then posits the enumeration of AWS storage services such as S3 buckets and Elastic Block Store volumes. This action would be part of the "Discovery" tactic, where the adversary seeks to gather information about the target environment, which could include cloud services. Enumerating cloud storage could provide valuable information about the target's data storage practices, potential vulnerabilities, or sensitive data that could be exploited.

4. **Communicating with a Command and Control (C2) Server Hosted on GitHub**: Finally, communicating with a C2 server hosted on GitHub suggests the use of a publicly accessible platform as a means to hide in plain sight or evade detection. This is a common tactic under "Command and Control" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where adversaries use various channels to communicate with compromised systems.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- The initial actions (achieving persistence and executing a malicious DLL) are typical of an adversary seeking to establish a foothold within a network.
- The enumeration of AWS storage services would logically follow as the adversary seeks to understand the target's infrastructure and identify potential targets for data exfiltration or further exploitation.
- Communicating with a C2 server is a necessary step for the adversary to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or upload additional tools.

Considering the Lazarus Group's sophistication and history of complex operations, it is plausible that they would engage in thorough reconnaissance, including the enumeration of cloud services, as part of their operational planning and execution. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that after establishing a foothold, they would indeed seek to gather more information about their target's cloud infrastructure before or in parallel with communicating with a C2 server.
