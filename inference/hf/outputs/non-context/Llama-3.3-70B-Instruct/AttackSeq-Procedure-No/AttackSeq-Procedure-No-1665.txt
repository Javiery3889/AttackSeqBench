To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the malware TDrop2 engaging in discovery activities before performing execution using process hollowing.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing**: The attack begins with spear-phishing emails that contain trojanized installation executables. This is a common initial access tactic (TA0001) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers use social engineering to trick users into installing malware.

2. **Discovery Activities**: After gaining initial access, the next logical steps for an attacker would typically involve discovery (TA0007) to understand the environment they have accessed. This includes gathering system information (e.g., T1018 - System Information Discovery) and network views (e.g., T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery) to identify potential targets, vulnerabilities, and paths for lateral movement.

3. **Execution Using Process Hollowing**: Process hollowing (T1496) is a technique used to evade detection by injecting malicious code into a legitimate process. This technique is often used after an attacker has gained a foothold and is looking to execute their payload without being detected by security software.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks:

- **Initial Access** is achieved through spear-phishing.
- **Discovery** activities would logically follow to inform the attacker's next steps.
- **Execution** using process hollowing is a plausible method to evade detection while running the malware.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after conducting initial access, the malware TDrop2 would indeed engage in discovery activities before performing execution using process hollowing to evade detection.
