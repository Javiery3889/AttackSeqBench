To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate their likelihood and logical order based on common adversary behaviors as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     - Creating system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software. This aligns with the "Create or Modify System Process" technique (T1543) and is associated with the "Resource Development" tactic, where adversaries attempt to utilize victim resources for their benefit, such as mining cryptocurrency.
     - Accessing the victim's VPN using credentials obtained through password spraying. This involves "Valid Accounts" (T1078) for the access and "Brute Force" (T1110) or specifically "Password Spraying" for the credential acquisition, both under the "Credential Access" tactic.
     - Installing the Cobalt Strike beacon using a PowerShell one-liner. This involves "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1059) and specifically "PowerShell" (T1086) for execution, under the "Execution" tactic, and the use of a beacon like Cobalt Strike is associated with "Command and Control" (C2) communications.

2. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The sequence provided in the question suggests an adversary who has already gained access to the system (as they are installing a beacon and creating system services) and is looking to expand their control and utilize system resources.
   - The use of password spraying to obtain credentials for VPN access could be an initial step in gaining access to a network, which would precede the installation of a beacon or the creation of system services for cryptocurrency mining.
   - The logical sequence of events in an attack typically involves initial access, followed by establishing a foothold, escalating privileges, and then moving laterally or executing the main objective, such as data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, or in this case, cryptocurrency mining.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary likely gained initial access through password spraying to obtain VPN credentials, allowing them to enter the network.
   - **Execution and Persistence:** Once inside, they could use a PowerShell one-liner to install a Cobalt Strike beacon, which provides a C2 channel and allows for further execution of commands.
   - **Resource Development:** After establishing a foothold, creating system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software would be a way to utilize the compromised system's resources for financial gain.

Given this analysis, the sequence described in the question seems plausible as it outlines a path from initial access (via password spraying and VPN access), to establishing a persistent presence (with the Cobalt Strike beacon), and finally to utilizing system resources (for cryptocurrency mining).

**Final Answer: A**
