To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the ProjectM actors as described.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that ProjectM actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks. This is a common initial access vector where attackers use social engineering tactics to trick victims into divulging sensitive information or gaining access to the victim's system.

2. **Reconnaissance**: After gaining initial access, the next logical step for attackers is to conduct reconnaissance. This involves gathering information about the victim's environment, which can include network and system configurations, user identities, and other sensitive data. Reconnaissance is crucial for planning the next stages of the attack, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, and exfiltration of sensitive data.

3. **Domain Registration**: Registering domains, with or without WHOIS protection services, is a technique that can be used for various purposes, including command and control (C2) communication, phishing, or as part of the attacker's infrastructure setup. This action can occur at different stages of the attack, depending on the attackers' objectives and the specific TTPs they employ.

Given the sequence described:
- **Initial Access** has been achieved.
- The question is whether **Reconnaissance** (gathering victim identity information) would occur **after** registering domains.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Access** is achieved through spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.
2. Typically, **Reconnaissance** would follow initial access to gather more information about the victim's environment, including identities.
3. **Domain Registration** could be part of setting up the attack infrastructure but doesn't necessarily dictate the sequence of reconnaissance activities.

Considering the logical flow of an attack, it's more plausible that reconnaissance efforts, including gathering victim identity information, would occur after initial access and potentially before, during, or after domain registration, depending on the attackers' needs and objectives. However, the question specifically asks if it's likely that gathering victim identity information occurred **only after** registering domains, which seems less likely given the typical sequence of attack operations.

**Final Answer: B**
