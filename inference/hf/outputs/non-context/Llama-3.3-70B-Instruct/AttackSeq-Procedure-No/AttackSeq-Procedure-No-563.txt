To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and analyze their logical order in the context of a cyber attack.

1. **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves manipulating the trust mechanisms of a system to bypass security controls. This could be done early in an attack to gain initial access or to maintain access by evading detection.

2. **T1071 Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with command and control (C2) servers. This is typically done after initial access has been gained to establish a channel for sending commands and receiving data from the compromised system.

3. **T1057 Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the running processes on a system. It's a reconnaissance technique used to understand the environment, identify potential targets, and plan further actions.

Given the sequence described:
- The attackers first subvert trust controls (T1553) to evade defenses.
- Then, they leverage compromised infrastructure for command and control (T1071), which implies they have established a way to communicate with the compromised system.
- After establishing command and control, it would be logical for the attackers to want to understand the system and network environment better, which is where **T1057 Process Discovery** comes into play.

Therefore, it is plausible that after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control (T1071), the threat actors would employ T1057 Process Discovery to gain more knowledge about the systems and internal networks of the compromised organizations. This sequence makes sense because understanding the process landscape of a compromised system is crucial for planning further actions, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration, and this would typically follow the establishment of a reliable command and control channel.
