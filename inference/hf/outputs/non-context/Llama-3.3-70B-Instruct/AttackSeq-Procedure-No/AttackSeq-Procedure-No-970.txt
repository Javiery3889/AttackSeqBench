To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario.

1. **Disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names for execution**: This is a common technique used by attackers to trick users into executing malware. It aligns with the "Masquerading" technique under the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Using verclsid.exe to download and execute a malicious script**: verclsid.exe is a legitimate Windows utility, but it can be abused by attackers to execute arbitrary code, including downloading and executing malicious scripts. This aligns with the "Signed Binary Proxy Execution" technique under the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Utilizing command-and-control (C2) infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services**: This describes a method for maintaining command and control over compromised systems. Using dynamic DNS services can help attackers maintain connectivity to their C2 infrastructure even if the IP address changes. This aligns with the "Dynamic DNS" technique under the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs described in the question represents a plausible attack scenario:
- The initial step of disguising malware as legitimate files is a common social engineering tactic to gain initial access.
- The use of verclsid.exe for executing malicious scripts is a known method for evading defenses once inside a network.
- Finally, utilizing dynamic DNS for C2 infrastructure is a method to maintain persistence and continue communicating with compromised systems.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of these TTPs and their alignment with known attack patterns, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access through disguised malware, an attacker might use verclsid.exe to further their goals, including downloading and executing malicious scripts, and then utilize C2 infrastructure for ongoing control.
