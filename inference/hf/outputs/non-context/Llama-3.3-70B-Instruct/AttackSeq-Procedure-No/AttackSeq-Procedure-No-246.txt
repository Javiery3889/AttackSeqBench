To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where HIDDEN COBRA, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has intercepted customer transaction data. This interception is achieved through malicious scripts injected into store checkout pages, which suggests a method of initial access and data collection. The question then asks if HIDDEN COBRA is likely to use the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) protocol to exfiltrate the collected data from the infected machine to the Command and Control (C2) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied here involves:
   - **Initial Access**: Injecting malicious scripts into store checkout pages to intercept customer transaction data.
   - **Data Collection**: Gathering the intercepted data.
   - **Exfiltration**: The potential use of the MIME protocol to transfer the collected data to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **MIME Protocol**: Typically used for sending binary data in email, but it can also be used for other forms of data transfer over the internet. However, in the context of exfiltrating data from an infected machine to a C2 server, the use of MIME might not be the most common or efficient method. Common exfiltration methods include using HTTP/S, FTP, or custom protocols designed to evade detection.
   - **HIDDEN COBRA TTPs**: Known for sophisticated attacks, HIDDEN COBRA's TTPs often involve complex methods for initial access, data collection, and exfiltration. While they might use various protocols for data exfiltration, the specific use of MIME for this purpose is not commonly highlighted in their known TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access and Data Collection**: The method described (injecting malicious scripts) is plausible for initial access and data collection.
   - **Exfiltration Method**: The question specifically asks about using the MIME protocol for exfiltration. Given that MIME is more commonly associated with email and not typically highlighted as a primary method for data exfiltration in CTI reports, this seems less likely compared to other methods like HTTP/S or custom protocols.
   - **Conclusion**: Based on the typical TTPs associated with HIDDEN COBRA and common data exfiltration methods, using MIME for this purpose seems less likely.

**Final Answer: B**
