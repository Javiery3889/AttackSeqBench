To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a specific sequence of actions related to a malware or threat actor known as WinDealer. The actions include:
   - Communicating with Command and Control (C2) servers.
   - Using an AES key encrypted with RSA for this communication.
   - The potential action of processing and encrypting stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase.

2. **Identifying TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The TTPs mentioned or implied include:
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: Using encrypted communication (AES with RSA) to interact with C2 servers. This is a common technique for malware to receive instructions and send back stolen data.
   - **Data Exfiltration**: The process of stealing and transferring data from a victim's system to the attacker's system. Encrypting stolen data (potentially as ".a" files) in the %TEMP% directory could be part of this tactic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after establishing secure communication with C2 servers, WinDealer would indeed process and encrypt stolen data in the described manner. This aligns with common malware behaviors where data is encrypted before exfiltration to avoid detection and to protect the data during transmission.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that WinDealer would not process and encrypt stolen data as described after communicating with C2 servers. Given the context, this seems less likely as encrypting data before exfiltration is a common practice among malware to maintain stealth and ensure the integrity of stolen data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Malware often uses encrypted communication channels (like AES with RSA) to interact with C2 servers, which is a known TTP.
   - Encrypting stolen data before exfiltration is a common practice to prevent interception and analysis by security systems.
   - The %TEMP% directory is a plausible location for temporary processing of stolen data due to its transient nature and the fact that files here might not be as closely monitored as other directories.
   - Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that after communicating with C2 servers, WinDealer would likely engage in data exfiltration activities, which could include processing and encrypting stolen data.

**Final Answer: A**
