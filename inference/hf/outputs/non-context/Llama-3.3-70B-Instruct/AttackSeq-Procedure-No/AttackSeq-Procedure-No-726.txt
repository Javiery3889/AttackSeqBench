To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the exploitation of specific vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) for lateral movement within a network, followed by a query about the likelihood of using the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication. The context provided points towards the behavior of the Stuxnet malware.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - The initial step involves exploiting vulnerabilities (MS08-067 and MS10-061) for lateral movement, which aligns with the "Lateral Movement" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically using "Exploitation of Remote Services" as a technique.
   - The subsequent step involves using the FTP protocol for C2 communication, which would fall under the "Command and Control" tactic, with "Application Layer Protocol" as a technique.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Stuxnet is known for its sophisticated design and use of multiple zero-day exploits for spreading, including the mentioned MS08-067 and MS10-061 vulnerabilities.
   - For C2 communication, Stuxnet is known to use HTTP, not typically FTP, for communicating with its command and control servers. This is crucial for understanding its behavior post-exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Exploitation**: Stuxnet indeed uses vulnerabilities like MS08-067 for initial infection and potentially others for lateral movement.
   - **C2 Communication**: The critical aspect here is the method of C2 communication. While Stuxnet does communicate with C2 servers, its primary method involves HTTP, not FTP.
   - **Conclusion**: Given Stuxnet's known behavior, using FTP for C2 communication does not align with its typical modus operandi.

**Final Answer: B**
