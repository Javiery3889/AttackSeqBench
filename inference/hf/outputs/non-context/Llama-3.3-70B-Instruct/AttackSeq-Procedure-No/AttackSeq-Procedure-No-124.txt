To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The attack starts with the execution of a malicious macro from MS Office documents. This macro downloads the RMS (Remote Management Software) tool and supporting scripts. This step indicates the initial access and execution phase, where the attackers gain a foothold into the system.

2. **Persistence**: The question mentions achieving persistence using the `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` command in MS-SQL. This command is used to create a linked server login, which can be used to access other servers in the network. This action aligns with the persistence tactic, as it allows the attackers to maintain access to the network.

3. **Defense Evasion**: The attempt to kill the 'rundll32.exe' process can be seen as an attempt at defense evasion. `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, but it can also be used by attackers to execute malicious code. Killing this process might be an attempt to evade detection or to disrupt potential security monitoring that focuses on this process.

Given this sequence of events:

- **Initial Access** is achieved through the malicious macro.
- **Persistence** is attempted through the use of `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` to link the compromised account with other servers.
- **Defense Evasion** is attempted by killing 'rundll32.exe'.

The sequence described in the question seems plausible because after gaining initial access and executing malicious code, achieving persistence is a logical next step for attackers to maintain access. Using a command like `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` for this purpose, especially in an environment with MS-SQL servers, is a viable method. Following this with an attempt to evade defenses by killing a process that could be monitored or used for malicious purposes also aligns with common attacker TTPs.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of attacker actions from initial access, to establishing persistence, and then attempting defense evasion, the sequence described in the question is plausible.
