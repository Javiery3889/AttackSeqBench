To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, particularly those associated with Longhorn, and the characteristics of the Plexor malware.

1. **Initial Infection Vector**: The use of a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware is a common initial access tactic (TA0001) according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This method leverages vulnerabilities in software (T1204) to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Plexor Malware**: Plexor is known for its capabilities in remote access and data exfiltration, often used in espionage campaigns. Its deployment suggests the attackers' interest in maintaining access and gathering sensitive information.

3. **System Fingerprinting and Discovery**: After initial access, attackers typically perform discovery actions (TA0007) to understand the network and system layouts. This includes system fingerprinting (T1217) to identify operating systems, software, and configurations. Given Longhorn's association with espionage-focused malware, it is plausible they would engage in these activities to identify valuable targets within the network and to plan further actions.

4. **Avoiding Detection**: Advanced threat actors, especially those with espionage goals, often follow guidelines or implement tactics (TA0005) to evade detection. This can include techniques like hiding in legitimate processes (T1093), using encryption (T1573), or manipulating system logs (T1562) to cover their tracks.

Considering these points, the sequence described aligns with common TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors:
- The initial infection with Plexor malware via a zero-day exploit is a known method for gaining access.
- System fingerprinting and discovery are typical next steps to understand the environment and identify potential targets or valuable data.
- Following guidelines to avoid detection is consistent with the behavior of espionage-focused groups aiming to maintain long-term access without being discovered.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after infecting a target with Plexor malware, Longhorn's tools would likely perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities as part of their espionage-focused operations, and they would take steps to avoid detection to maintain access and achieve their objectives.
