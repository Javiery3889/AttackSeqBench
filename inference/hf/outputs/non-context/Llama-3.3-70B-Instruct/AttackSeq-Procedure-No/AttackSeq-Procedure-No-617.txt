To answer this question, let's break it down into steps based on the information provided and the context of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) Involved:**
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic involves the development of capabilities and resources that can be used to support operations. The development of Bankshot implants falls under this category, as it involves creating tools that can be used for future attacks.
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. Techniques under this tactic can include spear phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and others.

2. **Analyzing the Attack Sequence:**
   - The question outlines a sequence where after developing specific implants (Bankshot) under the tactic of Resource Development, the attackers (attributed to Hidden Cobra) are considering targeting Turkish financial organizations.
   - The method of initial access mentioned is through spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits a specific vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878).

3. **Evaluating the Plausibility:**
   - **Exploit of CVE-2018-4878:** This vulnerability is related to Adobe Flash Player and allows for arbitrary code execution. It's plausible that attackers would use known vulnerabilities in commonly used software to gain initial access.
   - **Spear Phishing:** This is a common technique used for gaining initial access, especially when combined with exploits for known vulnerabilities. It's targeted and can be highly effective, especially against organizations with less stringent security controls or less aware users.
   - **Targeting Turkish Financial Organizations:** Given the development of specific tools (Bankshot implants) that can provide full control over victim systems and the capability to wipe files, targeting financial organizations makes sense. Financial institutions are high-value targets for cyber attackers due to the potential for financial gain and disruption.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Considering the development of specific malware (Bankshot) and the tactic of using spear phishing with an exploit for initial access, it is plausible that Hidden Cobra would target Turkish financial organizations in such a manner. The use of targeted phishing emails with exploits for known vulnerabilities is a common and effective method for gaining initial access to networks.

**Final Answer: A**
