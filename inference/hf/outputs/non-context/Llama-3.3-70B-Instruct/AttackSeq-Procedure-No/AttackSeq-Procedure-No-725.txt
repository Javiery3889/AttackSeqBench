To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of Stuxnet in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and general cybersecurity principles.

1. **Understanding Stuxnet's Behavior**: Stuxnet is a highly sophisticated computer worm discovered in 2010. It is known for its ability to target industrial control systems, specifically those used in Iran's nuclear program. Stuxnet communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) servers to receive updates and send back information about the infected systems.

2. **Initial Infection and C&C Communication**: The initial step mentioned involves Stuxnet communicating with its C&C servers using encrypted channels. This is plausible as Stuxnet is designed to operate stealthily and communicate with its operators for further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

3. **Exploitation for Lateral Movement**: The question then asks about the likelihood of Stuxnet exploiting specific vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) for lateral movement within the network. 
   - **MS08-067**: This is a vulnerability in the Windows Server Service that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. It was famously used by the Conficker worm but is also relevant in the context of Stuxnet's capabilities.
   - **MS10-061**: This vulnerability affects the Print Spooler service and can be exploited to execute code with system-level privileges.

4. **Evaluating the Sequence**: Given that Stuxnet is designed to spread and infect systems within a network, exploiting vulnerabilities for lateral movement is a common tactic, especially for malware aiming to maximize its impact within a targeted environment. Stuxnet's primary goal was to infect and sabotage specific industrial control systems, and exploiting vulnerabilities like MS08-067 and MS10-061 could facilitate this by allowing it to move laterally within a network, potentially reaching its intended targets more effectively.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering Stuxnet's sophisticated design, its goal of targeting and sabotaging specific systems, and the tactics commonly used by malware for lateral movement, it is plausible that after establishing communication with its C&C servers, Stuxnet would attempt to exploit vulnerabilities such as MS08-067 and MS10-061 to spread within the network.
