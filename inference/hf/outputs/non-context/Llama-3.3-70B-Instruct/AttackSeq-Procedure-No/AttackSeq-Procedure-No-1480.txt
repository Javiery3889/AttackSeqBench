To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the behavior of Seaduke as described:

1. **Understanding Seaduke's Behavior**: Seaduke is a type of malware known for its sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to gather system information and communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers. The "seppuku" function, which allows it to securely delete itself, indicates a level of complexity in its design to evade detection.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The question outlines specific TTPs associated with Seaduke, including:
   - Retrieving detailed bot/system information.
   - Securely deleting itself using a 'seppuku' function.
   - A method for calculating the C2 port.

3. **Evaluating the Calculation of the C2 Port**: The method described for calculating the C2 port involves multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and then adding the third octet. This is a specific and unusual method for determining a port number, suggesting a customized or hardcoded approach to establishing communication with the C2 server.

4. **Comparing with Known Behaviors**: While the exact details of Seaduke's operations can vary, the use of complex methods for C2 communication, including dynamic port calculation, is consistent with advanced malware trying to evade detection. However, without specific details on Seaduke's port calculation methods in publicly available CTI reports or the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we must consider the plausibility based on general malware behaviors.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the sophisticated nature of Seaduke and its capabilities, including the 'seppuku' function and the retrieval of system information, it is plausible that it could use a unique method for calculating its C2 port to maintain stealth and operational security. The method described, while specific, does not contradict known behaviors of advanced malware seeking to evade detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- Seaduke's known capabilities suggest a high degree of sophistication.
- The described method for calculating the C2 port is specific and could be part of its evasion techniques.
- Advanced malware often uses unique methods for C2 communication to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A**
