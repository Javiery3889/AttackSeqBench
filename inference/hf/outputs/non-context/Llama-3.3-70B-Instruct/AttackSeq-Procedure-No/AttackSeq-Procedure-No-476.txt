To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the situation based on the information provided about the Infamous Chisel malware and its behaviors, as well as general knowledge of cyber attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Infamous Chisel malware is used for automatic exfiltration of files at regular intervals. This exfiltration is facilitated through a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. The question then asks if it is likely that, after this exfiltration, the malware would perform a SYN flood attack on a host.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial TTPs mentioned involve data exfiltration (TA0010) using specific communication channels (Tor hidden service and SSH connections), which suggests an attempt to stealthily remove sensitive data from a compromised network. A SYN flood attack, on the other hand, is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack aimed at making a network resource unavailable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Data Exfiltration (TA0010)**: This is a common goal of many malware types, where the attacker seeks to remove sensitive information from a target system.
   - **SYN Flood Attack**: This is a type of network attack aimed at overwhelming a system with connection requests, rendering it unable to respond to legitimate traffic.
   
   Evaluating the likelihood of transitioning from data exfiltration to a SYN flood attack:
   - Data exfiltration is typically a stealthy operation, aiming to go undetected for as long as possible to maximize the amount of data that can be stolen.
   - A SYN flood attack, in contrast, is noisy and immediately detectable, as it involves a large volume of traffic aimed at overwhelming a system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the primary goal of the malware's current action (exfiltration), which is to steal data without detection.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the nature of a SYN flood attack, which is to deny service and is inherently detectable.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the logical progression from stealthy data theft to a loud, detectable attack. Typically, attackers prefer to maintain access and stealth unless their goals have shifted (e.g., from theft to disruption).
   - **Step 4**: Recognize that while anything is possible in cybersecurity, the transition from stealthy exfiltration to a noisy DoS attack might not be the most likely next step without additional context indicating a change in the attacker's objectives.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the information and the typical behaviors associated with malware and cyber attacks, the most plausible answer is that it is less likely for the malware to immediately proceed with a SYN flood attack after exfiltrating files, as this would significantly increase the likelihood of detection and potentially cut off access to the compromised system.

**Final Answer: B**
