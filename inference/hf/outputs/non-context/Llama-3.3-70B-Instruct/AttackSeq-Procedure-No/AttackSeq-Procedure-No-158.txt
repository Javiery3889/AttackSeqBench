To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate them in the context of known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) associated with APT10, a well-documented Advanced Persistent Threat group.

1. **Initial Access via Spear Phishing**: APT10 is known for using spear phishing as an initial access vector. This involves sending targeted emails with malicious attachments or links to gain access to a victim's system. This step aligns with the initial phase of many APT10 attacks.

2. **Extracting Names of Locally Reachable Wi-Fi Networks**: After gaining initial access, extracting information about the local network environment, including Wi-Fi networks, could be a plausible step for reconnaissance. This could help in planning further attacks or lateral movement. However, specific details about APT10's interest in Wi-Fi network names for brute-force attacks are less commonly highlighted in public reports.

3. **Brute-Force Attack to Spread to New Networks**: While brute-force attacks are a known TTP used by various threat actors to gain unauthorized access, the specific use of this technique by APT10 to spread to new networks by targeting Wi-Fi networks is not as prominently documented as other TTPs like exploiting vulnerabilities or using stolen credentials.

4. **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure for Lateral Movement**: APT10 is known for targeting Managed Service Providers (MSPs) as a way to gain access to multiple victims through a single entry point. This aligns with reported TTPs, where APT10 has been observed using compromised MSP infrastructure for lateral movement and further attacks.

Given these points, the sequence described involves a mix of well-documented and less commonly associated TTPs with APT10. However, the overall strategy of initial access through spear phishing, followed by lateral movement and exploitation of MSP infrastructure, is consistent with APT10's known operations.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- APT10 is known for spear phishing as an initial access vector.
- The extraction of Wi-Fi network names could be part of reconnaissance but is less specifically highlighted in APT10's TTPs.
- Brute-force attacks are used by various threat actors but are not the most prominently documented method for APT10 in this context.
- Leveraging MSP infrastructure for lateral movement is a known and significant aspect of APT10's TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
