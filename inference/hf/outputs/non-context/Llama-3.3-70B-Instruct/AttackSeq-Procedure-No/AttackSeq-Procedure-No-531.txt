To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Iterating through password stores and stealing user's Google Chrome credentials**: This action suggests the adversary is using techniques related to Credential Access (such as Credential Dumping, T1003) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The goal here is to obtain sensitive information that can be used for further malicious activities.

2. **Dropping Elephant backdoor**: The introduction of a backdoor (such as T1090, T1219) indicates the adversary is establishing persistence and possibly a command and control (C2) channel. Backdoors allow attackers to access the system at a later time, bypassing normal authentication mechanisms.

3. **Evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts**: This step involves Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027) and possibly Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) techniques. The adversary is using encoding to hide their scripts, which, once decoded, are executed via PowerShell. This is a common method to evade detection by traditional signature-based security controls, as the encoded content does not match known malicious patterns until it's decoded and executed.

4. **Downloading additional malware**: This action aligns with the technique of Initial Access (T1190) or Execution (T1204), where the adversary is using the established access to introduce more malicious software into the environment.

Given these steps, the sequence described involves:
- Initial access and credential theft
- Establishment of a backdoor for persistence
- Use of encoded scripts to evade detection and execute further malicious actions
- Downloading additional malware for potential lateral movement, further exploitation, or other malicious objectives

Considering the Dropping Elephant backdoor's capabilities and the described sequence of actions, it is reasonable to conclude that the backdoor could indeed be used to evade defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware. This aligns with common tactics used by sophisticated threats to maintain stealth and achieve their objectives within a compromised environment.
