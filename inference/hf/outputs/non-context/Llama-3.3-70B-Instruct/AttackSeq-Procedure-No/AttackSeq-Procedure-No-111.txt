To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical cyber attack sequence, especially focusing on the aspects of persistence, lateral movement, and the discovery phase, in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by attackers:
   - Installing additional persistence points on new systems: This refers to the tactic of Persistence (TA0003) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers try to maintain their foothold in a network.
   - Exploiting remote services to achieve lateral movement: This is related to the tactic of Lateral Movement (TA0008), where attackers move from system to system within a network to gain access to more sensitive data or systems.
   - Gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase: This aligns with the Discovery (TA0007) tactic, where attackers gather information about the network, systems, and users to plan their next steps.

2. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question essentially asks if gaining knowledge (discovery phase) is a prerequisite for exploiting remote services (lateral movement) after establishing persistence.
   - In a typical attack sequence, after establishing an initial foothold and ensuring persistence, attackers often seek to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and gather information that can aid in further exploitation. This discovery phase is crucial for planning effective lateral movement, as it helps attackers identify vulnerable services, accounts with necessary permissions, and valuable data locations.
   - Lateral movement via exploiting remote services is more likely to be successful if the attackers have a good understanding of the network, including which systems are connected, what services are exposed, and how data flows within the network.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Attackers establish an initial foothold and ensure persistence, which allows them to maintain access to the network.
   - **Step 2**: To effectively move laterally and achieve their objectives, attackers need to understand the network, its systems, and its data. This is where the discovery phase comes into play.
   - **Step 3**: With the knowledge gained from the discovery phase, attackers can then exploit remote services to move laterally, targeting specific systems or data that align with their mission objectives.

Given this sequence, it is logical that attackers would exploit remote services for lateral movement after gaining knowledge of the systems, users, and data through the discovery phase. This approach maximizes the chances of successful lateral movement and minimizes the risk of detection.

**Final Answer: A**
