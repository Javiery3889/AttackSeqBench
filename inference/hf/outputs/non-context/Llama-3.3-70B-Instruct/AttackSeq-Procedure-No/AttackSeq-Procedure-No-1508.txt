To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question involves RIG Exploit Kit (EK) and its potential actions. RIG EK is known for exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to systems. The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
   - Creating system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software.
   - Running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

2. **Understanding RIG EK's Typical Behavior**: RIG EK is primarily used for delivering malware, including ransomware, trojans, and other types of malicious software. It exploits vulnerabilities in web browsers and plugins to infect systems. While it's known for delivering a variety of payloads, the specific sequence of creating system services for cryptocurrency mining before running a PowerShell script to fetch additional malware is not its most commonly documented behavior.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Creating system services for cryptocurrency mining**: This action suggests an initial payload or stage of an attack focused on monetization through cryptocurrency mining. It implies that the attacker has already gained sufficient access to the system to create and manage services.
   - **Running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware**: This is a common technique used in many attacks to download additional malware or tools, leveraging the Command and Scripting Interpreter (in this case, PowerShell) for its versatility and ability to execute scripts without leaving much trace.

4. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The sequence described involves an initial step of setting up cryptocurrency mining, which is a payload that can be delivered by RIG EK, but it's less common as an immediate first step compared to other payloads like ransomware or trojans.
   - The use of PowerShell to fetch additional malware is a very common technique in the cyber threat landscape, often used in conjunction with various initial access vectors, including exploit kits like RIG.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - RIG EK is capable of delivering a wide range of malware.
   - The creation of system services for cryptocurrency mining could be a payload delivered by RIG EK, but it's not the most typical first step.
   - The use of an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware is a plausible and common next step in many attack sequences, as it allows for dynamic adjustment of the attack based on the compromised system's environment.

6. **Conclusion**: Given the capabilities of RIG EK and the common use of PowerShell in fetching additional malware, it's plausible that RIG EK could create system services for cryptocurrency mining before running an obfuscated PowerShell script. However, the specific sequence might not be the most common or documented behavior for RIG EK. Considering the question asks for likelihood rather than commonality, and given the versatility of RIG EK and the attackers' continuous evolution of TTPs, the answer leans towards acknowledging the possibility.
