To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied and evaluate the plausibility of the scenario described.

1. **Initial Access and Exploration**: The question starts with cybercriminals using remote administration tools to explore financial systems. This implies an initial access tactic, possibly through exploiting a vulnerability or using valid accounts (T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application), followed by the use of remote administration tools for exploration, which aligns with the technique of using valid accounts (T1078 - Valid Accounts) or possibly remote services (T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services).

2. **Discovery Phase**: The next step mentioned is gaining system administrators' credentials during the discovery phase. This is a common technique used by attackers to escalate privileges (T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) and move laterally within a network (T1021 - Remote Services). Gaining admin credentials would provide attackers with elevated access to systems and data.

3. **Defense Evasion and Persistence**: The question then mentions evading defenses by reinstalling malware on internal sites of compromised organizations using infrastructure software. This action aligns with defense evasion techniques, specifically T1112 - Modify Registry, T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information, or T1211 - Exploitation of Remote Services, where attackers modify system settings or use obfuscation to avoid detection. Reinstalling malware for persistence is a common tactic (T1055 - Scheduled Task/Job) to maintain access to the compromised network.

4. **Use of Infrastructure Software**: The use of infrastructure software for reinstalling malware suggests that attackers are leveraging existing software within the organization for their malicious purposes, which could be related to T1046 - Network Service Scanning, T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services, or T1204 - User Execution, depending on how the software is used.

Given this analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known TTPs used by cybercriminals:

- **Initial Access** and exploration
- **Credential Access** for privilege escalation
- **Defense Evasion** and **Persistence** through reinstalling malware

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining access and exploring a financial system, and after obtaining system administrators' credentials, cybercriminals could indeed use infrastructure software to reinstall malware as a method to evade defenses and maintain persistence within the compromised organization.
