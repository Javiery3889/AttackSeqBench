To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has performed initial reconnaissance. This implies that the implant has already gained access to the target system and is now gathering information. The TTPs mentioned include decrypting and collecting network and system information. The question then asks if it is likely that the implant communicated with its Command and Control (C2) server using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication after this initial reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The use of implants like Rising Sun for reconnaissance suggests a sophisticated attack, likely aimed at gathering sensitive information or establishing a persistent presence within the target network.
   - Communication with a C2 server is a common next step after initial reconnaissance, as it allows the attackers to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or upload additional malware.
   - The use of blogs and WordPress for C2 communication is a technique known as "dead drop resolver" or using legitimate services for covert communication. This method can help attackers blend in with normal network traffic, making their communications harder to detect.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Access and Reconnaissance**: The Rising Sun implant has already gained access and performed initial reconnaissance, indicating the attackers have a foothold in the system.
   - **Need for C2 Communication**: After reconnaissance, the next logical step would be to communicate with the C2 server to either receive further instructions or to exfiltrate the collected data.
   - **Plausibility of Using Blogs and WordPress for C2**: Using legitimate web services like blogs and WordPress for C2 communication is a known TTP that allows attackers to hide their malicious communications within regular web traffic, making it a plausible method for bidirectional communication.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of the attack and the TTPs involved, it is indeed plausible that the Rising Sun implant would use blogs and WordPress for communicating with its C2 server after initial reconnaissance. This method aligns with known tactics used by sophisticated attackers to maintain stealth and achieve their objectives.
