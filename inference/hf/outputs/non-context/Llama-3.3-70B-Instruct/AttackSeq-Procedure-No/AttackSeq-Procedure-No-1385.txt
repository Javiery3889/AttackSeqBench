To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned, in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Backdoor Establishment**: The question starts with FIN13 employing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE. This backdoor establishes a local HTTP server for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution. This action aligns with the "Initial Access" and "Execution" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Server Software Component: Web Shell" (T1505.003) for the backdoor aspect.

2. **Establishing Persistence**: The use of tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for establishing persistence indicates that the attackers are focusing on maintaining access to the compromised system. This aligns with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where techniques like "Application Access Token" (T1546.004) could be relevant for the use of trojanized applications.

3. **Exploiting External Servers for Web Shells and Malware Deployment**: The question then asks about the likelihood of exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access after establishing persistence. This action would typically be an initial access tactic, using techniques such as "Exploitation of Remote Services" (T1210) or "Server Software Component: Web Shell" (T1505.003) for the deployment of web shells.

Given the sequence of events:
- **Initial Access** is achieved through the backdoor (BLUEAGAVE).
- **Persistence** is established using tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.
- The question then inquires about using **Initial Access** tactics again, but this time for exploiting external servers.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access has already been achieved through the backdoor.
2. Persistence mechanisms are put in place, indicating the attackers have already gained a foothold and are looking to maintain access.
3. The deployment of web shells and custom malware on external servers for "initial access" seems out of sequence since initial access has been established. However, it's plausible if considered as an action to expand access or create additional entry points, which could be part of the "Lateral Movement" or "Command and Control" tactics rather than solely for initial access.

**Conclusion**: Considering the context provided, it seems less likely that the primary goal of exploiting external servers at this stage is for "initial access" since that has already been achieved. However, it's entirely plausible that attackers would seek to expand their foothold or create redundant access methods, which could involve similar techniques. The question's phrasing suggests a specific sequence that might not perfectly align with typical attack patterns, where initial access is a precursor to persistence, not the other way around.

**Final Answer: B**
