To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the Dropping Elephant threat actor using steganography as part of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the threat actor gains initial access through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. These are both valid initial access techniques as defined by the MITRE ATT&CK framework (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment and T1189 - Drive-by Compromise for watering hole attacks, respectively). This step is about establishing a foothold in the target network.

2. **Steganography for Hiding Malicious Executables**: The question then asks about the use of steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files. Steganography is a technique used to hide secret information (in this case, malicious executables) within non-secret messages, images, or other media. This technique aligns with the "Hide Artifacts" tactic in the ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Hidden Window" (T1143) and "Hidden File" (T1158) techniques, though steganography itself is more closely related to "Steganography" (T1027) under "Defense Evasion".

3. **Evading Detection by Decoding Encoded Blobs**: Finally, the question mentions evading detection by decoding encoded blobs. This action suggests the threat actor is taking steps to avoid being detected by security software or system administrators, which fits within the "Defense Evasion" tactic of the ATT&CK framework. Techniques like "Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information" (T1140) could be relevant here, as the actor would need to decode or deobfuscate the hidden executables to execute them.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that after gaining initial access, the Dropping Elephant threat actor would indeed use steganography to hide malicious executables and then evade detection by decoding these hidden files. This sequence aligns with known TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors to maintain stealth and achieve their objectives.

- **B: No** - This choice implies that the threat actor would not use steganography and decoding as part of their attack sequence. While it's possible, given the variety of TTPs threat actors can employ, this choice does not align as closely with the described sequence of actions that are known to be used for stealthy operations.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access methods (spear-phishing and watering hole attacks) are plausible and align with known TTPs.
2. The use of steganography to hide malicious files is a known technique used for evasion and stealth.
3. Decoding or deobfuscating files to evade detection is also a recognized technique.

**Final Answer**: A
