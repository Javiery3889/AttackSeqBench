To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving "Infamous Chisel," which is leveraging Command and Control (C2) capabilities. These capabilities include Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) functionality, a local Socks connection, and an SSH server and client. The question then asks if, after leveraging these C2 capabilities, Infamous Chisel is likely to perform discovery activities. These activities include enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network using the "netd" component.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied here starts with establishing C2 communications (using SCP, Socks, SSH server, and client) and then potentially moving on to discovery activities (enumerating data directories and IP scanning).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - **Establishing C2**: The initial step of leveraging C2 capabilities suggests that the attacker has gained access to the network and is setting up a means to control and communicate with compromised systems. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle, often following initial access and preceding further exploitation and discovery.
   - **Discovery Activities**: After establishing a foothold and C2, a typical next step for an attacker would be to perform discovery activities to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and gather information that could be used for further exploitation. Enumerating data directories and performing IP scanning are examples of discovery techniques that align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Discovery" tactic. This tactic involves techniques used to gather information about the target system or network that can be used to plan and execute subsequent attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Infamous Chisel establishes C2 capabilities, indicating it has gained access and is preparing for further actions.
   - **Step 2**: Given the context of C2 establishment, the next logical steps would involve gathering more information about the compromised system and network.
   - **Step 3**: Enumerating data directories and performing IP scanning are typical discovery activities that would follow C2 establishment, as they help in identifying valuable data, potential vulnerabilities, and network topology.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the typical sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack and the specific capabilities and actions described, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing C2, Infamous Chisel would indeed likely perform discovery activities such as enumerating data directories and IP scanning.

Final Answer: A
