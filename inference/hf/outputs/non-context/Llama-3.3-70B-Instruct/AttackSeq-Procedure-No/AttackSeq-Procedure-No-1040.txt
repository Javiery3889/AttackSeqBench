To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, particularly those associated with the Inception group, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Exploitation of Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882):** The question starts with the exploitation of a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-11882) to gain initial access. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, which is a common initial access vector. This step aligns with the "Exploitation of Remote Services" technique under the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Establishing Persistence:** After gaining initial access, establishing persistence is a crucial step for attackers to maintain access to the compromised system. Creating a scheduled task, such as `\Microsoft\Windows\PLA\Server Manager Performance Monitor`, is a technique used by attackers to achieve persistence. This aligns with the "Scheduled Task/Job" technique under the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Scheduled tasks can be used to execute malicious programs at specific times or intervals, making it a plausible step for maintaining access.

3. **Deploying a PowerShell Backdoor (POWERSHOWER):** Deploying a backdoor, such as POWERSHOWER, is a common technique used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system. PowerShell backdoors can provide attackers with a powerful tool for executing commands, exfiltrating data, and moving laterally within a network. This action aligns with the "Backdoor" technique under the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given these considerations, the sequence of actions described in the question—exploiting a vulnerability for initial access, establishing persistence through a scheduled task, and then deploying a backdoor—follows a logical and common pattern of attack behavior. Establishing persistence before deploying additional tools like a backdoor is a strategic move to ensure that the attackers can maintain access to the system even if the initial exploit is patched or otherwise mitigated.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- The initial exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 for gaining access is a known and effective method.
- Creating a scheduled task for persistence is a common technique that aligns with attacker TTPs.
- Deploying a PowerShell backdoor like POWERSHOWER after establishing persistence is consistent with maintaining access and control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A**
