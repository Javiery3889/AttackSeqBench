To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with Tropic Trooper and similar threat actors.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions the exploitation of either CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802. Both are vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain initial access to a system. CVE-2017-11882 is related to Microsoft Office, and CVE-2018-0802 is related to Microsoft Windows. Exploiting such vulnerabilities is a common initial access technique (TA0001) used by various threat actors, including Tropic Trooper.

2. **Spearphishing via Social Media**: The question then suggests that various social media channels were used to spearphish victims. Spearphishing (T1566) is a technique where attackers send targeted emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source, aiming to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. Using social media for spearphishing is a variation of this technique (T1566.003 - Spearphishing via Service), which is plausible given the increasing use of social media platforms by threat actors for initial contact with potential victims.

3. **Dropping a Backdoor Installer (UserInstall.exe)**: After initial access, the dropping of a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) suggests the use of a technique to establish persistence (TA0003) and possibly command and control (TA0011). Backdoors (T1219) allow attackers to access a system at a later time, bypassing normal authentication mechanisms.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that it is likely social media channels were used for spearphishing before the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer. This sequence aligns with a plausible attack scenario where initial contact is made through social media (spearphishing), leading to the exploitation of a vulnerability, and then the installation of a backdoor for persistence and further malicious activities.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the described sequence is unlikely. However, given the TTPs described, there's no inherent inconsistency in the sequence of events that would make it implausible without additional context suggesting otherwise.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial exploitation of vulnerabilities for access is consistent with known TTPs.
2. The use of social media for spearphishing is a modern and effective technique for initial contact.
3. The installation of a backdoor after initial access is a common method for establishing persistence.

**Final Answer**: A
