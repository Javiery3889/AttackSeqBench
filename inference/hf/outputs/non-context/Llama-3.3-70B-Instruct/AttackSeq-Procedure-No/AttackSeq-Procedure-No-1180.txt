To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate them in the context of known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) associated with the GADOLINIUM group, as well as general cyber attack patterns.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing**: The question starts with the delivery of malicious Access database files via spear-phishing emails. This is a common initial access technique (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment) used by various threat actors to gain initial access to a target's system.

2. **Infecting the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) DLL for Privilege Escalation**: The next step mentioned involves infecting the SAM DLL to load a malicious DLL for privilege escalation. This action aligns with techniques used for privilege escalation (T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation), where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities or uses other means to gain higher privileges on a system.

3. **Obfuscating Activities using Cloud Services and Open-Source Tools for Defense Evasion**: Finally, the question mentions the use of cloud services and open-source tools for defense evasion (T1562 - Impair Defenses, T1005 - Data from Local System, and potentially others related to cloud service abuse). This is a common practice among sophisticated threat actors to evade detection and make attribution more difficult.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the likelihood of GADOLINIUM engaging in such activities:

- **GADOLINIUM's Known TTPs**: While specific details about GADOLINIUM's TTPs are not provided in the question, the described sequence aligns with sophisticated threat actor behaviors. GADOLINIUM, like other advanced threat groups, would likely use a combination of social engineering, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and evasion techniques to achieve their objectives.

- **Plausibility of the Sequence**: The sequence described is plausible for a sophisticated threat actor. Initial access via spear-phishing, followed by privilege escalation, and then defense evasion using cloud services and open-source tools represents a coherent and effective strategy for achieving malicious goals within a target network while minimizing detection.

Based on the analysis, the described sequence of TTPs aligns with what could be expected from a sophisticated threat actor like GADOLINIUM, given the general patterns of cyber attacks and the use of such techniques for initial access, privilege escalation, and defense evasion.
