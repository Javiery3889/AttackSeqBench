To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions being part of a coherent attack strategy, particularly in the context of Iranian hackers and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with them.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions that includes sending "consent phishing" emails with malicious links aimed at stealing users' access tokens, followed by an attempt to gain initial access using social media platforms and spear-phishing messages. The TTPs mentioned here involve phishing techniques, specifically consent phishing and spear-phishing, which are both tactics used to deceive users into divulging sensitive information or gaining unauthorized access.

2. **Understanding Consent Phishing and Spear-Phishing**:
   - **Consent Phishing**: This is a type of phishing attack where the attacker tricks the user into granting access to sensitive information or permissions, often by exploiting the user's trust in a legitimate service or application. This can involve malicious links that, when clicked, redirect the user to a legitimate consent screen where they unknowingly grant permissions to the attacker.
   - **Spear-Phishing**: A targeted form of phishing where attackers send highly customized and personalized messages to specific individuals or groups to increase the likelihood of a successful attack. These messages often appear to come from a trusted source and are designed to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information or performing a certain action.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The use of consent phishing to steal access tokens aligns with the initial phase of an attack where attackers seek to gain a foothold or gather intelligence on potential targets.
   - Following up with spear-phishing messages via social media platforms is a plausible next step, as attackers may use the information gathered from the initial phishing campaign to craft more targeted and convincing messages.

4. **Likelihood and Plausibility**:
   - Given the context of Iranian hackers, who have been known to employ sophisticated social engineering tactics, including phishing, the described sequence of TTPs is plausible. Iranian threat actors have historically used phishing as a primary method for initial access, often tailoring their attacks to specific targets and using social engineering to bypass security controls.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the sequence of sending "consent phishing" emails followed by attempts to gain initial access via social media platforms and spear-phishing messages could be a part of a coherent attack strategy, especially considering the TTPs commonly associated with Iranian hackers.
