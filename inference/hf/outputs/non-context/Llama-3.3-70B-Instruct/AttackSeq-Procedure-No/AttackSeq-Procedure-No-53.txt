To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with the Lazarus group, as well as the general tactics used by threat actors in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Credential Access**: The question starts with the Lazarus group achieving credential access. This is a critical step for any threat actor, as it allows them to move beyond initial access and start interacting with the network and systems in a more privileged manner. The use of the Responder tool to acquire login credentials fits into the "Credential Access" tactic (TA0006) of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Lateral Movement**: After gaining credentials, the next logical step for an adversary like the Lazarus group would be to use those credentials for lateral movement. Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the network to expand access and control. The use of Windows commands and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) for lateral movement is common, as these tools are native to Windows environments and can be used to execute commands on remote systems, copy files (including malware), and establish network connections. This aligns with the "Lateral Movement" tactic (TA0008) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Discovery Activities**: Once an adversary has moved laterally within a network, conducting discovery activities is a typical next step. This involves gathering information about the network, systems, and applications to identify potential targets, vulnerabilities, and ways to maintain access or escalate privileges. System service discovery, which involves identifying services running on remote systems, is part of the "Discovery" tactic (TA0007) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given these steps, the question essentially asks if the Lazarus group would conduct discovery activities like system service discovery only after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement. 

- **Analysis**: The sequence described (credential access -> lateral movement -> discovery) is a logical and common sequence of actions for a threat actor aiming to expand their foothold within a network. Discovery activities, including system service discovery, are often performed after lateral movement to understand the newly accessible parts of the network and to plan further actions, such as privilege escalation, persistence, or exfiltration.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the typical TTPs of threat actors like the Lazarus group and the logical progression of tactics within the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is plausible that discovery activities such as system service discovery would occur after achieving lateral movement. Therefore, the answer to whether the Lazarus group is likely to conduct these activities in the described sequence is affirmative.
