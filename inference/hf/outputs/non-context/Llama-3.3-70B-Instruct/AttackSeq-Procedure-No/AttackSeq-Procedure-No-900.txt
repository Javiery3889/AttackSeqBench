To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the attacker's next steps based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The use of CARBANAK RAT (Remote Access Trojan) indicates the attacker has already gained initial access to the network and is executing their malware to establish a connection with their Command and Control (C2) server. This aligns with the "Initial Access" and "Execution" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Persistence and Defense Evasion**: Deploying secondary malware through obfuscated scripts suggests the attacker is attempting to evade detection and possibly maintain persistence. The use of obfuscated scripts aligns with "Defense Evasion" tactics. 

3. **Configuring a systemd Service for Persistence**: Configuring a systemd service is a method to achieve persistence, ensuring the malware remains on the system even after a reboot. This action directly aligns with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Given that the attacker has already shown an interest in maintaining access (through the use of a RAT and obfuscated scripts), configuring a systemd service for persistence is a plausible next step to ensure continued access.

4. **Reconnaissance**: Deploying reconnaissance tools like Cobalt Strike for network discovery is a common step after establishing a foothold and ensuring persistence. This aligns with the "Discovery" tactic, where attackers seek to gather information about the network and its components to plan further actions.

Given the sequence of events:
- The attacker has established access and is executing malware.
- They are taking steps to evade detection and possibly maintain persistence.
- The next logical steps would include ensuring persistence to maintain access and then conducting reconnaissance to understand the network layout and identify potential targets.

Therefore, configuring a systemd service to maintain persistence before deploying reconnaissance tools like Cobalt Strike for network discovery is a logical sequence of TTPs for an attacker aiming to establish a strong foothold in the network and gather intelligence for further exploitation.
