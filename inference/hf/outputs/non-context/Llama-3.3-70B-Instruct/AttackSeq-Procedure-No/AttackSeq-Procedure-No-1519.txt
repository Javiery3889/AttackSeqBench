To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence.

1. **Initial Access through Spear-Phishing Emails with Malicious DOCX Documents**: This is a common initial access vector where attackers send targeted emails with malicious attachments (in this case, DOCX documents) to gain access to a system. The use of the remote template technique within these documents can lead to the execution of malicious code.

2. **Exploiting Equation Editor Vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad Tool**: This step involves exploiting specific vulnerabilities (e.g., in Equation Editor) to execute malicious code. RoyalRoad is a tool known for its use in exploiting such vulnerabilities to deliver malware. This action could be part of the initial infection chain, leveraging vulnerabilities to gain code execution.

3. **Creating a Scheduled Task for Persistence**: After gaining access and possibly executing initial malware, creating a scheduled task (named 'Windows Update' in this case) is a technique used for persistence. This allows the attackers to maintain access to the system even after the initial infection vector has been mitigated.

Given the sequence:
- **Initial Access** is typically followed by actions to establish a foothold and then **Persistence** mechanisms to maintain that access.
- **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities** like those in Equation Editor can be an initial step to execute code, which might happen after the initial access vector (like opening a malicious document) has been successful.

However, the question suggests that the exploitation of Equation Editor vulnerabilities and the use of RoyalRoad occur **after** gaining initial access through spear-phishing and **after** creating a scheduled task for persistence. This ordering seems less likely because typically, exploiting vulnerabilities (like those in Equation Editor) would be an earlier step in the attack chain, used to gain initial code execution or escalate privileges, rather than a step that occurs after persistence mechanisms have been established.

Therefore, considering the typical sequence of TTPs in an attack, the described sequence seems unusual because exploiting vulnerabilities usually precedes or is part of the initial access and execution phases, not a step that occurs after establishing persistence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Identify the sequence of TTPs: Initial Access via spear-phishing, followed by exploitation of vulnerabilities, and then persistence.
2. Evaluate the likelihood of this sequence: The exploitation of vulnerabilities typically occurs early in the attack chain.
3. Conclusion: The sequence provided in the question does not align well with typical attack patterns.

**Final Answer: B**
