To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events described and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved, considering the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Vector**: The attack starts with recipients being presented with a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report. This could be considered a form of social engineering, aiming to establish trust or curiosity in the recipient.

2. **Exploitation**: The next step involves the exploitation of CVE-2017-8759 (though the question mentions CVE-2017-8750, it seems to be a typo, as CVE-2017-8759 is a known vulnerability related to the delivery of QuasarRAT via RTF documents). This exploitation leads to the delivery of QuasarRAT, a remote access trojan (RAT) that allows attackers to control infected systems remotely.

3. **Spear Phishing with RTF Documents**: The question then mentions the receipt of spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents that exploit the mentioned CVE for QuasarRAT delivery. This step seems to be a continuation or a part of the attack sequence aimed at spreading the malware.

Given this sequence, the question asks if it's likely that recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting the CVE for QuasarRAT delivery **only after** getting infected with QuasarRAT.

**Analysis**:
- The exploitation of CVE-2017-8759 (or the intended CVE) to deliver QuasarRAT typically occurs before the attacker has control over the system. Once a system is infected with QuasarRAT, the attacker can perform various malicious activities, including but not limited to, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and further exploitation.
- The receipt of spear phishing emails with malicious RTF documents is a method used to infect systems with malware like QuasarRAT, not typically something that happens as a result of already being infected.

**Conclusion**:
Given the typical attack sequence, it is unlikely that recipients would receive spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents for QuasarRAT delivery **only after** they have already been infected with QuasarRAT. The spear phishing with RTF documents is more likely a vector for initial infection rather than a post-infection activity.

**Final Answer: B**
