To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the malware enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting before establishing a connection to a command and control (C2) server.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with phishing emails containing weaponized MS Office attachments. This is a common initial access technique (TTP) used by adversaries to gain entry into a network. The use of phishing emails with malicious attachments, especially those that require macros to be enabled (such as in the case of MS Office documents), is a well-documented tactic.

2. **Execution**: Once the attachment is opened and macros are enabled, the BlackEnergy 3 malware is installed. BlackEnergy is known for its capabilities in conducting reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities, and facilitating further malicious activities within a compromised network.

3. **Internal Network Reconnaissance and Credential Harvesting**: After gaining initial access and executing the malware, it is plausible that the next steps would involve internal network reconnaissance to understand the network layout, identify potential targets (such as sensitive data stores or critical infrastructure), and harvest credentials. This would typically involve techniques like network service scanning, system network configuration discovery, and credential dumping, all of which are common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Establishing C2 Communication**: Establishing a connection from the malicious implant to an attacker-controlled C2 server is a critical step for exfiltrating stolen data, receiving further commands, and potentially deploying additional malware. This step is often preceded by reconnaissance and credential harvesting to ensure that the C2 channel can be maintained without detection and to maximize the adversary's ability to move laterally within the network.

Given the sequence of events described:
- The initial access via phishing emails with malicious attachments is a common entry point.
- The installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware provides the capability for further exploitation and reconnaissance.
- The logical next steps after initial compromise would indeed include internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting to facilitate deeper access and persistence.
- Establishing a C2 connection would follow these steps as a means to leverage the compromised network for the adversary's objectives.

Therefore, it is logical and consistent with known adversary TTPs that after initial access and malware installation, the malware would enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting before establishing a connection to a C2 server.
