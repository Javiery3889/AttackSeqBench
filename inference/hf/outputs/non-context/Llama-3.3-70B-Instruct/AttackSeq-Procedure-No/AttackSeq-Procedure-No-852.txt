To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question mentions "Dexphot," which refers to a type of malware. It's known for its sophisticated evasion techniques and ability to persist on compromised systems.

2. **Techniques Mentioned**: The question talks about ensuring persistence through "dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks" and using techniques like "Scheduled Task" and "Signed Binary Proxy Execution." These are methods used by malware to maintain access to a system and execute malicious actions without being detected.

3. **CVE-2015-4902**: This is a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited by malware to bypass security features. The question is asking whether Dexphot, after establishing persistence, would likely use this vulnerability as part of its defense evasion tactics.

4. **Defense Evasion Tactics**: Malware often employs various tactics to evade detection by security software. Using vulnerabilities like CVE-2015-4902 could be one such tactic, allowing the malware to operate undetected.

5. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Yes**: This option suggests that Dexphot would likely use CVE-2015-4902 as part of its defense evasion tactics after ensuring persistence. Given that Dexphot is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, it's plausible that it would exploit known vulnerabilities to further evade detection.
   - **B: No**: This option implies that Dexphot would not use CVE-2015-4902 for defense evasion. However, without specific information on why Dexphot would avoid this vulnerability, it's less likely to be the correct answer given the context of the question.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the nature of Dexphot's known behaviors, it's reasonable to conclude that Dexphot would indeed attempt to exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2015-4902 as part of its defense evasion tactics, especially after establishing persistence on a system.

Final Answer: A
