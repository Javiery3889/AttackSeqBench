To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of FIN4's actions based on typical adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as understood through the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence where FIN4, presumably a threat actor group, is involved in the credential access phase, transmitting stolen credentials to their Command and Control (C2) servers. It mentions the use of Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The key TTPs here involve:
   - **Credential Access**: FIN4 is collecting credentials.
   - **Command and Control**: They are using C2 servers to receive stolen credentials and possibly for further command and control activities.
   - **Use of Tor for Anonymous Communication**: This implies an attempt to hide their tracks and maintain anonymity during the command and control phase.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Credential Transmission and C2 Servers**: It's common for threat actors to use C2 servers for collecting stolen data, including credentials. This aligns with the **Exfiltration** and **Command and Control** tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Use of Tor**: Utilizing Tor for anonymous communication is a technique (**T1053: Command and Control Channel Encryption** and **T1064: Scripting** for setting up such channels) that adversaries use to hide their C2 communications, making it harder for defenders to detect and track their activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - FIN4's use of C2 servers for collecting credentials is a standard practice for exfiltrating stolen data.
   - The use of Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase is a technique to maintain stealth.
   - Given that the question asks if it's likely that FIN4 uses C2 servers for collecting credentials only after relying on Tor for anonymous communication, we must consider if this sequence makes tactical sense. Typically, a threat actor would establish a secure (and anonymous, if possible) C2 channel before or concurrently with exfiltrating sensitive data like credentials. The use of Tor would facilitate this anonymity.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that FIN4 would use C2 servers for collecting credentials after establishing a secure and anonymous communication channel using Tor. This approach aligns with common practices among threat actors aiming to minimize detection.

**Final Answer: A**
