To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Enumerating browser data and reporting window names**: This action suggests the adversary is in the "Discovery" phase, where they are gathering information about the system and the user. This could involve techniques like `T1057 - Application Window Discovery` and `T1217 - Browser Bookmark Discovery` from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Hooking several Windows API functions to steal credentials**: After discovery, if the adversary aims to steal credentials, they might use techniques like `T1056 - Input Capture` or `T1185 - Man-in-the-Browser` to intercept user input or manipulate browser sessions. Hooking Windows API functions is a common method to achieve this, aligning with techniques under `T1056`.

3. **Using Command and Control (C2) channels like FTP and HTTP for communication**: Establishing C2 channels is a crucial step for exfiltrating stolen data and receiving further commands. Techniques like `T1041 - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel` and specifically using protocols like FTP (`T1041.003`) and HTTP (`T1041.001`) for C2 communication are well-documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given this sequence:
- The initial step of enumerating browser data and reporting window names sets the stage for targeted credential theft.
- Hooking Windows API functions is a plausible next step to achieve credential theft, fitting the adversary's goal of stealing sensitive information.
- Finally, using established C2 channels like FTP and HTTP for communication with command and control servers is a logical conclusion to exfiltrate stolen credentials and potentially receive further instructions.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of these TTPs and their alignment with known adversary behaviors as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the sequence described in the question forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence.
