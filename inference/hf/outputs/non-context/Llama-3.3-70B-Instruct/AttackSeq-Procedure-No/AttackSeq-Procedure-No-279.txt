To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in determining the likelihood of the OceanLotus backdoor executing in the manner described:

1. **Understanding OceanLotus**: OceanLotus, also known as APT32 or APT-C-00, is a sophisticated threat actor group known for targeting Southeast Asian governments, businesses, and other organizations. They are known for using custom malware, including backdoors, in their operations.

2. **Backdoor Functionality**: A backdoor is a type of malware that allows an attacker to access a network or system remotely, bypassing normal security mechanisms. The functionality of a backdoor can include executing files, stealing data, and installing additional malware.

3. **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The described sequence involves several TTPs:
   - **Execution of a hidden file (.CFUserEncoding)**: This could be a technique used to maintain persistence or execute malicious code without being detected.
   - **Displaying a decoy document**: This is a common technique used by attackers to deceive victims into believing that the attachment or downloaded file is legitimate, while the actual malicious activity happens in the background.
   - **Delivery via an email attachment as part of a phishing campaign**: Phishing is a tactic used to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions that compromise security. Email attachments are a common vector for delivering malware.

4. **Analysis of the Sequence**:
   - The sequence described (executing a hidden file, displaying a decoy document, and being delivered via email) aligns with known tactics used by sophisticated threat actors like OceanLotus to infect systems without immediate detection.
   - The use of decoy documents is a well-documented technique to distract from the actual malicious activity, making it plausible that OceanLotus could employ such a tactic.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the sophistication of OceanLotus and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by advanced threat actors, it is plausible that the OceanLotus backdoor could execute a hidden file named .CFUserEncoding, display a decoy document, and be delivered via an email attachment as part of a phishing campaign.
