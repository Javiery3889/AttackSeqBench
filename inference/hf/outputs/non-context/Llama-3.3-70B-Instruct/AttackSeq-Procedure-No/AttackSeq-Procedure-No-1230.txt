To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the given information in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like the Lazarus group.

1. **Establishing Command and Control (C2) Communication**: The Lazarus group used backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to communicate with remote C&C servers. This is a common technique (T1043: Commonly Used Port) where attackers establish a channel to issue commands to compromised systems. This step aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Double-Extortion Ransomware**: This involves exfiltrating sensitive data and then encrypting it. The attackers threaten to release the exfiltrated data unless a ransom is paid. This tactic combines data theft (exfiltration) with ransomware (encryption). In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this could be related to "Data Encrypted for Impact" (T1486) and "Data Staged (T1074)" for exfiltration preparation.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: It is plausible that after establishing C2 communication, the Lazarus group could engage in double-extortion ransomware tactics. Establishing a reliable C2 channel is a precursor to many types of malicious activities, including data exfiltration and ransomware deployment. The ability to execute commands remotely allows attackers to upload and execute ransomware, as well as manage the exfiltration of sensitive data. This aligns with known TTPs of sophisticated threat actors who often combine multiple tactics for maximum impact.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the establishment of C2 communication and the engagement in double-extortion ransomware are unrelated or that one does not typically follow the other. However, given the context of the Lazarus group's capabilities and the common TTPs observed in the wild, this seems less likely.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The Lazarus group has established a means of command and control.
2. This capability allows for the execution of various malicious tasks, including the deployment of ransomware and exfiltration tools.
3. Double-extortion ransomware is a tactic that has been increasingly used by sophisticated threat actors, combining the immediate financial gain of ransomware with the long-term leverage of exfiltrated data.
4. The Lazarus group's known sophistication and history of complex operations make it plausible they would engage in such tactics.

**Final Answer: A**
