To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by a threat actor, specifically mentioning the compression and encryption of stolen data for exfiltration over a command and control (C2) channel. This action is typically associated with the exfiltration phase of an attack, where the attacker is trying to remove stolen data from the compromised system.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned include data compression, encryption, and exfiltration over a C2 channel. These are techniques often used to hide and protect stolen data during its transmission out of the target network.

3. **Understanding the Context of T9000**: Without specific details on what "T9000" refers to, we can infer from the context that it might be a piece of malware, a threat actor, or a specific TTP set. The question implies that T9000 is capable of various malicious activities, including data exfiltration and potentially collecting sensitive data from specific sources like Skype communications and removable drives.

4. **Evaluating the Sequence**: The question asks if, after exfiltrating data, T9000 would then steal sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives during the collection phase. The collection phase typically occurs before exfiltration, as it involves gathering data of interest from the compromised system or network.

5. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after exfiltrating data, T9000 would then engage in a collection activity. This seems out of sequence because collection typically precedes exfiltration.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that the sequence described (exfiltration followed by collection from specific sources like Skype and removable drives) is unlikely or out of order. Given the typical flow of an attack (collection followed by exfiltration), this seems more plausible.

6. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack sequence typically involves reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control, and finally, exfiltration.
   - Collection of sensitive data (like from Skype communications and removable drives) would logically occur before the exfiltration of that data.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that after exfiltrating data, the next step would be to collect more data, as this reverses the expected order of operations in a cyber attack.

**Final Answer: B**
