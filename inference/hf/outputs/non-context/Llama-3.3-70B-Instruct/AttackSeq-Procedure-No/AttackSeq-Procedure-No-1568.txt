To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Abusing elevation control mechanisms and employing obfuscation techniques during privilege escalation**: This indicates an attacker is attempting to gain higher privileges within a system, possibly using techniques that hide their actions (obfuscation) to avoid detection. This aligns with the "Privilege Escalation" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves techniques used to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network.

2. **Exploit services file permissions weakness as a defense evasion technique**: This involves taking advantage of poorly configured file permissions for services to execute malicious code or hide malicious files, which is a method of defense evasion. This technique would help an attacker maintain access or avoid detection by exploiting vulnerabilities in how services are configured, fitting into the "Defense Evasion" tactic of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Targeting user credentials using tools like procdump to dump the memory of the lsass process**: This step involves using a tool (procdump) to extract credentials from the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process, which is a common technique for obtaining user credentials. This action aligns with the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, aimed at obtaining credentials to further access systems or data.

Given these steps, the sequence described is plausible for several reasons:
- **Privilege escalation** is often a precursor to other malicious activities because higher privileges provide more capabilities to the attacker.
- **Defense evasion** techniques, such as exploiting services file permissions weaknesses, can be used at various stages of an attack to maintain access or avoid detection, including after privilege escalation and before attempting to access sensitive data like credentials.
- **Credential access**, such as dumping LSASS, is a common goal for attackers to gain further access to systems, data, or to move laterally within a network.

Therefore, it is logical that after escalating privileges and employing evasion techniques, an attacker like Earth Lusca would attempt to exploit weaknesses in services file permissions as part of defense evasion before targeting user credentials, as this sequence facilitates further malicious activity while attempting to remain undetected.
