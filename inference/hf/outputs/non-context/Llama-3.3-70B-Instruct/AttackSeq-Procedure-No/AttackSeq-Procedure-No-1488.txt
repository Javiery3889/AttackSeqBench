To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware like BlackEnergy.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where BlackEnergy 3 malware communicates with its Command and Control (C2) server using the HTTP protocol. It sends localization data and keyboard layout information, which could be used for profiling the victim's system or for future targeted attacks. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox as part of its exfiltration process.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs here involves:
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied through the presence of malware.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The malware communicates with its C2 server using HTTP.
   - **Collection**: It collects localization data and keyboard layout information.
   - The question implies a potential **Exfiltration** step, specifically asking about exfiltrating stolen files to Dropbox.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: Malware often uses existing protocols (like HTTP, FTP, or even cloud services) for exfiltration to blend in with normal network traffic. Using Dropbox, a cloud storage service, for exfiltration is a known TTP, as it can provide a covert channel for data exfiltration.
   - **Automated Exfiltration**: Many modern malware strains are designed to automate as much of the attack process as possible, including exfiltration, to minimize the need for manual intervention by the attackers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - BlackEnergy malware is known for its sophistication and ability to adapt, including using various C2 channels and potentially exfiltrating data.
   - The use of HTTP for C2 communication indicates the malware's ability to blend in with normal traffic, a common tactic to avoid detection.
   - Exfiltrating data to cloud services like Dropbox is a tactic used by various malware families to evade traditional network defenses.
   - Given the automation of many malware functions and the goal of minimizing detection, it's plausible that BlackEnergy 3 could be designed to automatically exfiltrate stolen files.

5. **Final Answer**: Considering the capabilities of BlackEnergy malware, the use of cloud services for exfiltration is a known tactic, and the automation of such processes is common, the most plausible answer is:
**Final Answer: A**
