To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied and evaluate the plausibility of the scenario described:

1. **Initial Access through Malicious LNK Files**: The use of malicious LNK (shortcut) files is a known technique for gaining initial access to a system. This method involves tricking a user into opening a malicious LNK file, which then executes malicious code. This technique aligns with the "Phishing" or "Spearphishing Attachment" techniques under the Initial Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Delivery of Payloads via a Convoluting Infection Chain**: This suggests a complex or multi-stage infection process where the initial payload leads to the delivery of additional payloads, potentially including the njRAT malware. This is consistent with the "Delivery" tactic, where an attacker delivers a malicious payload to a target system.

3. **Deployment of njRAT Malware for Credential Harvesting**: njRAT is a remote access trojan known for its capabilities in credential harvesting among other malicious activities. Its deployment after initial access and delivery aligns with the "Credential Access" tactic, where an attacker attempts to obtain credentials.

4. **Exfiltration of Kavach Authentication Databases**: Kavach is an Indian government-backed COVID-19 contact tracing app, and exfiltrating its authentication databases would involve accessing and transferring sensitive data from infected devices. This action aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic, where an attacker transfers data from a compromised system.

Given the sequence of TTPs:
- The initial access is gained through malicious means (malicious LNK files).
- A complex delivery mechanism is used to deploy the njRAT malware.
- The malware is used for credential harvesting, which could include targeting specific databases like those used by Kavach for authentication.

**SideCopy**, known for its involvement in various cyber attacks, could plausibly engage in such a sequence of activities, especially considering the modular nature of modern cyber attacks where different tools and techniques are combined to achieve specific goals.

**Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs described, it is plausible that SideCopy could exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases after gaining initial access and deploying njRAT for credential harvesting. This sequence of actions aligns with known cyber attack patterns and the capabilities of the tools and techniques mentioned.
