To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the situation based on the information provided and the general understanding of cyber attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions APT-TOCS, which refers to a specific Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group.
   - It mentions the use of PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control (C2) operations. This indicates an initial stage of compromise where the attacker is setting up a means to issue commands to the compromised system.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of lateral movement through network projection within the internal network after this initial step.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Lateral Movement (TTP)**: This is a technique used by attackers to move through a network, often in search of sensitive data or to expand their control. It involves moving from one system to another, often using credentials obtained during the initial compromise or exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Network Projection**: This could be interpreted as the ability of the attacker to project their influence or control across the network, which aligns with the concept of lateral movement.
   - Given that APT-TOCS has already established a C2 channel using PowerShell, the next logical step in their operation could indeed involve expanding their foothold within the network. This would typically involve lateral movement to identify valuable targets, such as sensitive data stores, or to compromise additional systems to increase their control and persistence within the network.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Initial Compromise**: APT-TOCS uses PowerShell for C2, indicating they have gained initial access and are setting up for further operations.
   - **Establishing Persistence**: The use of encrypted data scripts suggests an attempt to maintain stealth and persistence, which is a common goal after initial compromise.
   - **Lateral Movement**: To achieve their objectives (e.g., data exfiltration, disruption), moving laterally within the network is a logical next step. This allows them to discover and access more valuable assets.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the typical behavior of APT groups, it is reasonable to expect that after establishing a C2 channel, APT-TOCS would attempt to move laterally within the network to expand their control and achieve their objectives.

**Final Answer: A**
