To address this question, let's break down the key components and analyze the sequence of events described:

1. **CCleaner Binary Execution and Malicious Code**: The question mentions the CCleaner binary executing malicious code by calling a specific function, `CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)`, and then initiating decryption of a malicious payload. This implies a sequence of events where the CCleaner binary is compromised and contains malicious code that is executed upon certain conditions being met.

2. **Compromised CCleaner 5.33 Installation Package**: The question specifies that this malicious activity is part of a compromised CCleaner 5.33 installation package. This indicates a supply chain attack where the CCleaner software, a legitimate tool for cleaning temporary files and other items from computers, has been tampered with to include malicious code.

3. **Signed with a Valid Digital Certificate**: The compromised package is signed with a valid digital certificate, which suggests that the attackers managed to obtain a legitimate certificate, possibly by compromising the developer's system or through other means, to make the malicious package appear as a genuine and trustworthy download.

Given these points, let's evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence:

- **Plausibility of Malicious Code Execution**: It is plausible that a compromised binary could execute malicious code, especially if the binary itself has been tampered with, as suggested by the mention of a specific function call (`CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)`) that initiates malicious activity.

- **Decryption of Malicious Payload**: The decryption of a malicious payload after the execution of the compromised binary is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection, as the malicious code is only decrypted and executed in memory, making it harder for security software to detect.

- **Compromised Software Distribution**: The distribution of compromised software through a legitimate channel (in this case, a signed installation package) is a known attack vector. The fact that the package is signed with a valid digital certificate increases the likelihood that users and security software would trust the package, allowing the malicious code to be installed without raising alarms.

Considering these points, the sequence of events described in the question aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, particularly in supply chain attacks. Therefore, it is indeed likely that a compromised CCleaner binary could execute malicious code and initiate the decryption of a malicious payload, especially when distributed as part of a compromised installation package signed with a valid digital certificate.
