To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate its plausibility based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with an email attachment and social engineering to trick the target into executing a .src file. This aligns with the "Phishing" technique (T1566) under the "Initial Access" tactic, where attackers use social engineering to deceive victims into performing certain actions.

2. **Execution**: The use of a .src file for initial access is less common but could be associated with "User Execution" (T1204), where the attacker relies on the user to execute the file. However, the mention of a PowerShell script like TANKTRAP for spreading and launching a wiper indicates a move towards "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1059), specifically using PowerShell for execution.

3. **Lateral Movement and Impact**: The utilization of a PowerShell script to spread and launch a wiper suggests an attempt to move laterally within the network and cause significant disruption. This aligns with "Inhibit System Recovery" (T1490) and possibly "Data Destruction" (T1485) under the "Impact" tactic, where attackers aim to make systems unrecoverable or destroy data.

4. **Persistence**: Achieving persistence by creating a Windows shortcut in the startup folder is a technique known as "Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" (T1547), specifically "Startup Folder" (T1547.001), which allows the attacker's tool to be executed automatically after a system reboot or user logon.

Given this sequence:
- The initial access via social engineering and execution of a malicious file is plausible.
- The use of a PowerShell script for lateral movement and to launch a wiper is consistent with known attack patterns that aim to spread quickly and cause significant damage.
- Achieving persistence through creating a startup shortcut is a common method to ensure continued access.

Therefore, the sequence described in the question follows a logical and plausible attack pattern based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and observed real-world attacks.
