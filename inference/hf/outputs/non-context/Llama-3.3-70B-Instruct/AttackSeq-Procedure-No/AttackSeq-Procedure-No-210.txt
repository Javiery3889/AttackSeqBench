To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **System Information Discovery**: This is a technique used by attackers to gather information about the target system, which can include details such as the operating system, hardware, and software configurations. This step is typically part of the reconnaissance phase and is used to plan further actions.

2. **Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing images of what is currently displayed on the user's screen. It can be used for various purposes, including gathering sensitive information that might be visible on the screen, such as login credentials, emails, or other confidential data.

3. **Communication with a C2 Server over a Non-Standard Port**: Command and Control (C2) servers are used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems. Using a non-standard port for this communication is a common tactic to evade detection by traditional security measures that monitor standard ports for known services.

4. **Exfiltrating Data through the Same C2 Channel**: Data exfiltration involves transferring sensitive data from the compromised system to the attacker's server. Using the same C2 channel for exfiltration as for command and control communication is efficient and reduces the complexity of managing multiple communication channels.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after employing system information discovery and screen capture, the Milestone backdoor would indeed communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port and then use the same channel for data exfiltration. This sequence aligns with common attack patterns where initial reconnaissance (system information discovery and screen capture) is followed by establishing a covert communication channel (C2 server communication over a non-standard port) for further malicious activities, including data exfiltration.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the described sequence of events is unlikely, which contradicts the typical behavior of backdoors and the purpose of using C2 servers in cyber attacks.

Considering the typical behavior of backdoors like Milestone and the common TTPs used in cyber attacks, the sequence described in the question aligns well with known attack patterns. Therefore, it is plausible that after initial reconnaissance activities, a backdoor would establish communication with a C2 server over a non-standard port for stealth and then use this channel for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
