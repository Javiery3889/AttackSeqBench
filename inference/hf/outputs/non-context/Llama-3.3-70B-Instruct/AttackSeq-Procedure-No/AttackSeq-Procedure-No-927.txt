To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate its plausibility based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Communication with C2 Server**: The use of the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server over HTTPS indicates that the attackers have already gained initial access to the network. This aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic (TA0011) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers establish a means to communicate with compromised systems.

2. **Lateral Movement using Stolen Credentials and EternalBlue Exploit**: Lateral movement (TA0008) involves moving from one system to another within a network. Using stolen credentials (T1003) is a common technique for lateral movement, as it allows attackers to access systems without being detected as easily. The EternalBlue exploit (SMB exploit, related to vulnerability MS17-010) is often used for lateral movement as well, especially in networks where this vulnerability has not been patched. This combination is plausible as it leverages both credential-based access and exploitation of vulnerabilities for movement.

3. **Exploiting a Vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to Install Webshells for Persistence**: Installing webshells (T1505.003) for persistence (TA0003) is a tactic used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system. Exploiting vulnerabilities in applications like Microsoft SharePoint to achieve this is well-documented. SharePoint vulnerabilities can be exploited to upload webshells, providing a persistent access point to the network.

Given this sequence:
- The attackers have already established communication with a C2 server, indicating initial access.
- They then perform lateral movement, which is a logical next step after gaining initial access, to expand their foothold within the network.
- Finally, exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells provides a means for persistence, ensuring they can maintain access to the network even if other entry points are discovered and closed.

This sequence of TTPs aligns well with common attack patterns observed in the wild, where attackers seek to gain access, move laterally to achieve their objectives, and establish persistence to maintain access over time.
