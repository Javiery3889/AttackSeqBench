To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the typical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), specifically the Darkhotel APT.

1. **Initial Access**: The Darkhotel APT gains initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates. This is a common TTP for many APT groups, including Darkhotel, which has been known to use spear-phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities in software to gain initial access.

2. **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources**: After gaining initial access, the question suggests that the next step would be to compromise trusted commercial network resources to support their operations. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in hotel networks or other public Wi-Fi spots that the targets frequent, which aligns with Darkhotel's known modus operandi. They have been observed targeting business travelers by compromising hotel networks.

3. **Reconnaissance**: The final step mentioned is performing reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans. Reconnaissance is a critical phase in the attack lifecycle, where attackers gather information about the target environment, network, and potential vulnerabilities. For APTs like Darkhotel, which have been known to target high-value individuals such as business executives and government officials, gathering detailed information about their targets' travel plans and whereabouts would be a logical step to tailor their attacks effectively.

Given these steps, the question essentially asks if compromising network resources to support operations would occur before performing reconnaissance. In the context of the Darkhotel APT's known TTPs, it is plausible that they would first compromise network resources to establish a foothold and then use this access to perform reconnaissance. This sequence makes sense because having control over network resources would provide them with the necessary access and vantage point to gather detailed information about their targets.

However, the question's phrasing suggests a linear progression that might oversimplify the actual complexity of APT operations. In reality, these activities can occur concurrently or in a non-linear fashion, with reconnaissance potentially starting even before the initial compromise to identify vulnerabilities and tailor the attack vector.

Considering the provided answer choices and the context of the question:

- **A: Yes** suggests that compromising network resources to support operations would indeed occur before performing reconnaissance, which aligns with a possible interpretation of how an APT might sequence its activities after initial access.
- **B: No** implies that reconnaissance would occur before or concurrently with compromising network resources, which could also be a valid approach depending on the specific goals and tactics of the APT at that moment.

Given the information provided and the known TTPs of the Darkhotel APT, the most straightforward interpretation based on the question's sequence would lean towards the APT using compromised network resources as part of their operations, which could include gathering intelligence on their targets. However, the question's framing around the sequence of events (compromising resources before reconnaissance) might not fully capture the complexity and flexibility of real-world APT operations.

Final Answer: B
