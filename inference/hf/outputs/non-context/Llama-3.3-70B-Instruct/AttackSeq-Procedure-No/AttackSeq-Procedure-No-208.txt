To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Persistence**: The question starts with Deep Panda gaining persistence through the Milestone backdoor. This backdoor is copied to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`, and a service named `msupdate2` is created directly in the registry. This action suggests that the attacker has already gained some level of access to the system and is establishing a method for maintaining that access.

2. **Technique Mentioned - UAC Bypass**: The question then mentions the potential use of a variation of the `ucmDccwCOMMethod` technique to abuse the Windows AutoElevate backdoor for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) and elevating privileges. UAC is a Windows security feature designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the system. Bypassing UAC would allow an attacker to execute actions that normally require administrator privileges without prompting the user for approval.

3. **Analysis of TTPs**:
   - **Persistence (TA0003)**: The initial action of copying the backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service in the registry falls under persistence techniques, where an attacker maintains their access to the system.
   - **Privilege Escalation (TA0004)**: The attempt to bypass UAC to elevate privileges is a form of privilege escalation, where an attacker seeks to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network.

4. **Evaluating the Plausibility**:
   - Given that Deep Panda has already demonstrated the capability to gain initial access and establish persistence, it is plausible that they would attempt to escalate their privileges to achieve their objectives more effectively.
   - Bypassing UAC is a common technique used by attackers to elevate privileges without alerting the user, which aligns with the goals of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group like Deep Panda.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the context provided and the typical behaviors of APT groups, it is reasonable to conclude that Deep Panda would indeed attempt to implement a variation of the `ucmDccwCOMMethod` technique or similar UAC bypass methods to elevate privileges after gaining persistence.
