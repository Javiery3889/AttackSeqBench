To answer this question, let's break it down step by step, analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluating the likelihood of the described sequence of actions.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gained access to a network and are using various tools and techniques for lateral movement. Specifically, they are using direct shell commands or features from frameworks like Cobalt Strike (such as psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh) to spread beacons (likely referring to beaconing back to a command and control server) across other systems within the network. This action is part of the "Lateral Movement" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned involve:
   - **Lateral Movement**: Using tools and techniques to move from one system to another within the network.
   - The question then asks about the likelihood of using tools like **ADFind** (for gathering Active Directory information) and **port scanning** (to discover open ports and services on the network) as part of the **Discovery** process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery** is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework that involves gathering information about the network, systems, and applications. This can include network service scanning (like port scanning) and gathering information about the Active Directory (using tools like ADFind).
   - After achieving lateral movement, attackers typically seek to understand the network layout, identify potential targets (such as domain controllers, sensitive data stores, etc.), and plan their next steps, which could include escalation of privileges, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement.
   - Using ADFind for Active Directory information and port scanning for network discovery aligns with the goals of the Discovery tactic. It helps attackers to map the network, identify potential vulnerabilities, and plan their next moves.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Attackers have already demonstrated the ability to move laterally within the network.
   - The next logical step for attackers, after establishing a foothold and moving laterally, is to gather more information about the network and its components.
   - Tools like ADFind and port scanning are directly relevant to this goal, as they provide valuable information about the network's structure and potential vulnerabilities.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the logical progression of attacker TTPs, it is indeed likely that after achieving lateral movement, attackers would use tools like ADFind and port scanning as part of their discovery process to gather more information about the Active Directory and the network.

Final Answer: A
