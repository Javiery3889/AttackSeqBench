To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Step - Evasion**: The question starts with the attackers attempting to evade defenses using scripts like AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat. This indicates an initial phase where attackers are trying to bypass security controls to gain access or maintain access within a network.

2. **Reconnaissance**: The next phase involves using tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, and Fast SYN Scanner for reconnaissance. This phase is about gathering information on the target network, including services running and potential vulnerabilities. Medusa is a brute-force login attack tool, which aligns with attempting to authenticate to services. Simple SMTP Scanner and Fast SYN Scanner are used for network scanning to identify open ports and services.

3. **Follow-up Actions - Internal Reconnaissance and Remote Control**: After the initial reconnaissance and potential authentication, the attackers then use Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package. Advanced IP Scanner is used for network scanning to identify internal hosts, which fits as a follow-up to the initial reconnaissance to map out the internal network. Radmin and PushVNC package are tools for remotely controlling computers, which would be useful after identifying targets within the network and potentially gaining access through brute force or other means.

Given this sequence:
- The initial evasion attempts are aimed at bypassing security to gain access.
- The reconnaissance phase involves identifying services, scanning the network, and attempting to authenticate via brute force.
- The subsequent actions involve detailed internal network scanning and setting up remote control mechanisms.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Evasion**: Attempting to evade defenses is a precursor to other actions, aiming to bypass security controls.
2. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information and attempting to authenticate to services is a logical next step after evasion, as it helps in understanding the target environment.
3. **Internal Reconnaissance and Remote Control**: After identifying potential targets and services, using tools for internal network scanning and remote control makes sense as it allows for further exploitation and control of the network.

**Conclusion**: The sequence described in the question outlines a plausible attack sequence where after attempting to evade defenses and conducting reconnaissance (including brute force attempts), attackers would indeed use tools for internal host identification and remote control to further their objectives within the network.

**Final Answer: A**
