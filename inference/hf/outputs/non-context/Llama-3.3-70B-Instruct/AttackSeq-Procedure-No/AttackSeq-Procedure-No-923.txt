To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on the information provided.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions the exploitation of a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access. This is a plausible initial access vector, as exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications is a common method used by attackers to gain a foothold in a network.

2. **Execution and Persistence**: After gaining initial access, the attackers installed webshells on SharePoint servers. Webshells are a common tool used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised web application and can be used to execute commands on the server. This step aligns with the tactics of maintaining persistence and preparing for further execution of malicious commands or tools.

3. **Scanning and Exploitation**: The attackers then scanned the network for vulnerable systems, targeting CVE-2017-0144 (likely referring to the EternalBlue vulnerability). This vulnerability is known for its use in lateral movement and exploitation within a network. Scanning for and exploiting this vulnerability would allow the attackers to move laterally within the network, compromising additional systems.

4. **Tool Upload and Execution**: Finally, the question mentions the upload of various tools and custom backdoors, such as HyperBro, for execution. This step would follow the initial access, persistence, and lateral movement phases, as the attackers would seek to establish a more robust presence within the network, potentially for espionage, data exfiltration, or further malicious activities.

Given this sequence of events:
- The initial exploitation of a SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) for gaining access is plausible.
- The installation of webshells for persistence and command execution is a common tactic.
- Scanning for and exploiting CVE-2017-0144 for lateral movement is consistent with known attack patterns.
- Uploading custom tools and backdoors after establishing a foothold is a logical step for further exploitation and persistence.

Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with known attack patterns and the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly in the areas of Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Lateral Movement.
