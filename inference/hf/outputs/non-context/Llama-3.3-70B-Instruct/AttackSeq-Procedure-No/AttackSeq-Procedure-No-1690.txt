To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned, in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with sending a PDF attachment that evades security filters, suggesting a social engineering tactic (e.g., Spearphishing Attachment - T1193) aimed at gaining initial access to the system. This is a common and effective method used by attackers to bypass security controls and gain a foothold in a network.

2. **Execution**: The fact that the PDF appeared benign but was used to initiate an attack implies it might have contained malicious code or was designed to exploit a vulnerability in the PDF reader (e.g., Exploitation for Client Execution - T1203), allowing the attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's system.

3. **Privilege Escalation**: The mention of abusing the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass User Account Control (UAC) while elevating privileges refers to a technique used for privilege escalation (e.g., Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism - T1548, specifically exploiting UAC bypass techniques). This step is crucial for attackers to gain higher privileges, enabling them to perform more significant malicious activities on the compromised system.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- **Social engineering or exploitation** to gain initial access is a common first step in many attacks.
- **Executing malicious code** through exploited vulnerabilities or embedded code in files like PDFs is a well-documented TTP.
- **Abusing system features** like AutoElevate for privilege escalation is also a recognized technique, especially in the context of Windows environments where UAC is a common security control.

Considering these points, the sequence described aligns well with known attack patterns and TTPs as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Therefore, it is plausible that an attack could initiate with a benign-appearing PDF attachment and proceed to abuse Windows features for privilege escalation.
