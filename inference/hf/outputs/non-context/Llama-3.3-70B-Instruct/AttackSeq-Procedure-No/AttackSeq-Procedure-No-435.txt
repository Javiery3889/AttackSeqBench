To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and analyze the logical flow of the attack sequence:

1. **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882**: The attack starts with the exploitation of a known vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) via an RTF (Rich Text Format) document. This is a common initial access technique used by attackers to gain a foothold into a system.

2. **Dropping an HTA File and Executing the FinalBot Backdoor with DLL Sideloadng**: After the initial exploitation, an HTA (HTML Application) file is dropped, which then executes the FinalBot backdoor. The use of DLL sideloading for defense evasion indicates an attempt to avoid detection by traditional security software. This step involves the execution of malicious code and evasion techniques.

3. **Communication with the C2 Server via webserv-redir.net**: The HTA file communicates with a Command and Control (C2) server using webserv-redir.net. This step is about establishing communication for further instructions or exfiltrating data.

4. **WMI Checking for Installed Antivirus Software**: The question asks whether the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) would check for installed antivirus software only after the communication with the C2 server has been established.

Given the sequence of events:
- The exploitation and initial infection are focused on gaining access and establishing a foothold.
- The execution of the backdoor and communication with the C2 server are about maintaining access and potentially preparing for further malicious activities.
- Checking for installed antivirus software is a reconnaissance step that could be performed at various stages of the attack to understand the security posture of the compromised system.

However, the specific timing of when WMI checks for installed antivirus software in relation to the communication with the C2 server isn't strictly sequential in a way that one must happen immediately after the other in all scenarios. Attackers might perform reconnaissance (like checking for antivirus software) at different points in their operation, depending on their goals and the specific tools they are using.

But considering the logical flow of establishing a foothold, executing malicious code, communicating with a C2 server, and then potentially using WMI for reconnaissance (which could include checking for antivirus software as part of understanding the system's security configuration), it's plausible that such a check could occur after initial communication with the C2 server as part of further system compromise or preparation for additional malicious activities.

Therefore, considering the attack sequence and the logical progression of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the answer to whether WMI would check for installed antivirus software only after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server and leverages webserv-redir.net for Command and Control could be seen as affirmative in the context of this specific attack sequence.
