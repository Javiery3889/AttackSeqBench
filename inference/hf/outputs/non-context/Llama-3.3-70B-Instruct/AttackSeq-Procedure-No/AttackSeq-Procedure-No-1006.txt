To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence.

1. **Initial Step - Vulnerability Scanning**: The group starts by conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses. This action is typically associated with the "Reconnaissance" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Active Scanning" technique (T1595). The goal here is to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain access to the target systems.

2. **Using Known Credentials**: After identifying vulnerabilities, the group plans to use known credentials to run commands and spawn processes as a local user account. This aligns with the "Credential Access" tactic and specifically the "Use Alternate Authentication Material" technique (T1550), where attackers use acquired credentials to access systems. Running commands and spawning processes as a local user could be part of the "Execution" tactic, particularly the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique (T1059), where attackers use command and scripting interpreters to execute commands.

3. **Maintaining Persistence**: Finally, the group intends to use stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems. This is directly related to the "Persistence" tactic, where attackers try to maintain their access to the system. Using stolen credentials for persistence can be seen as part of the "Valid Accounts" technique (T1078), where attackers use valid accounts to maintain access, or the "Credential Dumping" technique (T1003) followed by using those credentials for persistence.

Given this sequence:
- The initial reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning provide a means to identify entry points.
- Using known credentials to execute commands and spawn processes as a local user account is a plausible next step after gaining initial access, as it allows the attackers to establish a foothold within the system.
- Finally, using stolen credentials for maintaining persistence is a logical step to ensure continued access without relying on the initial entry method, which might be patched or otherwise mitigated.

**Conclusion**: The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of attack tactics and techniques that are commonly observed in real-world attacks. Therefore, it is indeed likely that the group would use known credentials to run commands and spawn processes as a local user account before using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.
