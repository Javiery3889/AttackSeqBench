To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described events unfolding as suggested.

1. **Initial Access through Phishing Emails**: The campaign starts with phishing emails containing a malicious file named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. This is a common tactic used by attackers to gain initial access to a network. The document likely contains macros or exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to execute malicious code on the victim's system.

2. **Exploitation of CVE-2018-13379**: After gaining initial access, the question posits that the attackers might exploit CVE-2018-13379, a vulnerability in FortiOS devices. This vulnerability allows for path traversal and arbitrary file reading, which could potentially be used to obtain sensitive information such as VPN passwords, allowing further unauthorized access.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the likelihood of this sequence:

- **Initial Access**: Phishing emails are a common and effective method for gaining initial access to a network. The use of a malicious document attachment is a well-documented tactic, often leading to the execution of malware or the installation of a backdoor on the victim's system.

- **Post-Exploitation and Lateral Movement**: After initial access, attackers often seek to escalate privileges, move laterally within the network, and exploit vulnerabilities in other systems or devices to achieve their objectives. The exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 could be part of this process, especially if the attackers identify FortiOS devices within the network that have not been patched against this vulnerability.

- **Likelihood of Exploiting CVE-2018-13379**: Given that the vulnerability provides a means to obtain sensitive information and potentially gain further access, it is plausible that attackers, having gained initial access, would seek to exploit known vulnerabilities in network devices like those running FortiOS. The fact that this vulnerability has been widely known and exploited in the past increases its attractiveness as a target.

Considering these points, the sequence of events described in the question aligns with common attack patterns observed in the wild. Attackers often use initial access gained through phishing or other means as a foothold to exploit additional vulnerabilities within a network, including those in network devices.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Phishing emails are used for initial access, which is a common and effective tactic.
2. The exploitation of a known vulnerability like CVE-2018-13379 post-initial access is consistent with tactics used for lateral movement and privilege escalation.
3. The goal of exploiting such a vulnerability aligns with common objectives of attackers, such as gaining further access or sensitive information.

**Final Answer: A**
