To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.

1. **Initial Access through OLE2 Format Documents**: The question mentions the use of OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails as a method for gaining initial access. OLE2 (Object Linking and Embedding) is an older format that can be used to embed various types of data, including links, within documents. Spear phishing emails are a common initial access vector where attackers send targeted emails to specific individuals, often with malicious attachments or links designed to trick the recipient into opening or clicking on them, thereby initiating the attack.

2. **Use of Microsoft Word to Send a GET Request**: The next step mentioned involves using Microsoft Word to send a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance. This technique leverages the functionality of Microsoft Word to make HTTP requests, potentially as part of a larger reconnaissance effort to gather information about the target environment, such as software versions or configurations.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- **Initial Access (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment)**: The use of spear phishing emails with malicious attachments (such as OLE2 documents with embedded links) is a well-documented TTP for gaining initial access to a network. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's technique for spearphishing attachment (T1193), where attackers send emails with attachments that, when opened, lead to the execution of malicious code.

- **Reconnaissance (T1614 - System Location Discovery, etc.)**: After gaining access, the use of Microsoft Word to send a GET request could be part of system reconnaissance. Techniques like system location discovery (T1614) involve gathering information about the system's location, which might include understanding the software environment. While the specific method of using Microsoft Word for this purpose is less common, the concept of using existing software to gather reconnaissance is well within the realm of known attacker TTPs.

Considering these points, the sequence described in the question aligns with plausible attacker behavior:

- **Initial access** is achieved through a common vector (spear phishing with malicious attachments/documents).
- **Reconnaissance** efforts to understand the target environment (in this case, using an unconventional method involving Microsoft Word) are consistent with post-compromise activities aimed at informing further malicious actions.

Therefore, based on the steps outlined and the alignment with known TTPs, the sequence described is plausible.
