To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the proposed sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with spear phishing activities targeting the ASEAN region. This is a common initial access technique (T1193) where attackers send targeted emails to specific individuals, often with the goal of tricking them into revealing sensitive information or gaining access to their systems.

2. **Reconnaissance**: The use of a decoy document suspected to be stolen for reconnaissance suggests that the attackers are gathering information about their target. This could involve collecting information about the target's environment, such as software versions, network topology, or specific details about the employees (e.g., names, roles).

3. **Exploitation**: The mention of exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components like wab.exe and wab32res.dll is a method of achieving initial access (T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application) by exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. This specific vulnerability is related to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Address Book, which could allow remote code execution.

Given these steps, the question essentially asks whether it's likely that instead of exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to gain initial access, the attackers would focus on collecting victim employee name information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Spear Phishing for Reconnaissance**: The initial step involves spear phishing, which can be used for both reconnaissance (collecting information) and initial access (gaining access to a system). The fact that a decoy document is used suggests the attackers are interested in gathering specific information.
- **Collecting Employee Information**: Collecting victim employee name information could be a part of the reconnaissance phase, helping attackers to better tailor their phishing attempts or to use in further social engineering attacks.
- **Exploiting CVE-2012-0158**: This is a specific method of achieving initial access by exploiting a known vulnerability. It's a direct approach to gaining access to a system by executing malicious code.

**Evaluation**:
- The question posits two different approaches after the initial spear phishing attempt: either continuing with reconnaissance by collecting employee information or exploiting a known vulnerability for initial access.
- Collecting employee information (such as names) could be seen as a less direct approach, focusing on gathering intelligence that might be used in future attacks, including more targeted phishing attempts.
- Exploiting CVE-2012-0158 is a direct method of gaining initial access, which aligns with the goal of many cyber attacks: to establish a foothold within the target's network.

**Conclusion**:
Given the context, it seems plausible that after initial spear phishing activities, attackers might prioritize collecting information (such as employee names) for further reconnaissance over immediately exploiting a vulnerability like CVE-2012-0158. This approach allows them to gather more targeted information that could be used in subsequent, more focused attacks. Therefore, the answer to whether it's likely that victim employee name information will be collected instead of exploiting the mentioned CVE for initial access is affirmative.
