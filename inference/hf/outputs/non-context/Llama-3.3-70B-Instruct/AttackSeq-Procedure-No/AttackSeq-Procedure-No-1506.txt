To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the exploit server using domain fronting for command and control (C2) operations.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an exploit kit, specifically RIG EK, uses proxy servers to obscure the detection of infections. It then inquires about the likelihood of this exploit kit utilizing domain fronting to further disguise its C2 operations by making them appear as if they originate from a different server within the same Content Delivery Network (CDN).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - **Proxy Servers**: Using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's technique of "Proxy" (T1090.001), which involves using a proxy to hide the source of the traffic.
   - **Domain Fronting**: The potential use of domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic. Domain fronting is a technique where an attacker uses different domain names in the SNI (Server Name Indication) field of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake and the HTTP Host header to disguise the true destination of the traffic. This can be related to the "Application Window Discovery" and "Proxy" techniques but is more specifically about evading detection by making traffic appear as if it's destined for a different, often legitimate, domain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: Given that RIG EK is already using proxy servers to evade detection, it's plausible that it would also use domain fronting as an additional layer of obfuscation for its C2 operations. Domain fronting can make it particularly challenging for defenders to detect and block malicious traffic, as the traffic appears to be communicating with a legitimate server.
   - **Option B (No)**: This option suggests that RIG EK would not use domain fronting for its C2 operations. However, considering the kit's use of proxy servers for evasion, it seems less likely that it would not leverage another available evasion technique, especially one as effective as domain fronting, for its C2 communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of proxy servers indicates an intent to evade detection.
   - Domain fronting is a technique that can further enhance evasion capabilities, especially for C2 communications.
   - The combination of these techniques aligns with sophisticated evasion strategies often employed by advanced threats.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that RIG EK's exploit server would likely use domain fronting to further disguise its C2 operations.

**Final Answer: A**
