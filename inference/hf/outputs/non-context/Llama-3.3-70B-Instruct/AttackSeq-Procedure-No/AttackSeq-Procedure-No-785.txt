To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, particularly those associated with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) like the Higaisa group.

1. **Initiation via LNK File**: The use of an LNK (shortcut) file to initiate multi-stage commands is a known TTP. LNK files can be used to execute malicious commands or scripts when opened, making them a viable vector for initial access (TA0001) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Execution Phase - JavaScript File Execution**: The execution of a JavaScript file as part of the attack's execution phase (TA0002) is also a plausible step. JavaScript files can be used to execute system commands, download additional payloads, or interact with the operating system in various ways, facilitating further stages of the attack.

3. **Maintaining Persistence**: The question then asks about the likelihood of the JavaScript file copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence but only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks. Maintaining persistence (TA0003) is a critical aspect of APT operations, allowing the attackers to retain access to the compromised system.

   - **Adding 'officeupdate.exe' to Scheduled Tasks**: This action would fall under the "Scheduled Task/Job" technique (T1053) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary may use scheduled tasks to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.
   
   - **Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the Startup Directory**: This action would be an example of the "Startup Folder" technique (T1060) for maintaining persistence, where an adversary places a malicious executable in a startup folder so that it is executed when the system boots up.

Given these considerations, the sequence described involves plausible steps for an APT group like Higaisa to establish and maintain persistence on a compromised system. The specific order of operations (adding to scheduled tasks before copying to the startup directory) could be part of a strategy to ensure that the system is properly configured for persistence before attempting to modify startup items, which might be more noticeable or require additional privileges.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial vector (LNK file) and the use of a JavaScript file for execution are common TTPs.
2. Maintaining persistence through scheduled tasks and startup folder modifications are also well-documented techniques.
3. The sequence described, while specific, does not contradict known behaviors of APT groups aiming to establish durable access to compromised systems.

**Final Answer: A**
