To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions.

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers gain initial access by exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet. This is a common vulnerability that can be exploited to gain access to a system or network.

2. **Deploying Malicious Containers**: After gaining access, the attackers deploy malicious containers. This action suggests that the attackers are using the exploited Docker API to run their own containers, which could be for various purposes such as establishing a foothold, escalating privileges, or moving laterally within the network.

3. **Reconnaissance and Detection of Compromised Docker APIs**: The question mentions the use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance to detect compromised Docker APIs. DOCKERGEDDON is a tool that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in Docker APIs, but in this context, it's mentioned as a tool for detection during reconnaissance.

Given this sequence, the question essentially asks if it's likely that attackers would use tools like DOCKERGEDDON for detecting compromised Docker APIs only after they have already deployed malicious containers.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Initial Exploitation**: Attackers exploit exposed Docker API ports for initial access, which is a plausible first step.
- **Deploying Malicious Containers**: After gaining access, deploying malicious containers is a logical next step to establish a presence or move further into the network.
- **Reconnaissance**: The use of tools for reconnaissance, including detecting compromised Docker APIs, could be part of the attackers' efforts to understand the environment and identify potential vulnerabilities or entry points. However, the specific timing (only after deploying malicious containers) and purpose (detecting compromised Docker APIs using a tool that's more known for exploitation) seems less likely as the primary motivation for using such a tool at this stage.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that detecting compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON after deploying malicious containers is a likely step. However, this seems counterintuitive because the primary goal of exploiting Docker APIs would typically be to gain access or deploy malicious containers, not to detect compromised APIs after the fact.
- **B: No**: This choice implies that it's unlikely adversaries would use tools like DOCKERGEDDON for detecting compromised Docker APIs only after deploying malicious containers. Given the context, this seems more plausible because the initial exploitation and deployment of malicious containers are more direct actions related to the attack's objectives. Using a tool for detection at this stage, especially one associated with exploitation, doesn't align well with the typical sequence of attack actions.

**Final Answer**: B
