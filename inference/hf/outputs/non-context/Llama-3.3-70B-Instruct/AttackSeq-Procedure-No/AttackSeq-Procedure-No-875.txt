To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the Naikon APT group executing additional commands before using HTTP and TCP protocols for Command and Control (C&C) communication.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the Aria-body backdoor collecting detailed information from the victim's machine. This action suggests an initial stage of reconnaissance or data gathering, which is a common tactic used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups like Naikon to understand the victim's environment better.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied here starts with data collection (likely as part of the "Discovery" or "Collection" phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework). The question then hints at potential further actions (executing additional commands) before establishing C&C communication using HTTP and TCP protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Executing Additional Commands**: After the initial data collection, it's plausible that the attackers would want to execute additional commands to further compromise the system, escalate privileges, or prepare for the exfiltration of sensitive data. This action aligns with tactics like "Execution" and "Privilege Escalation" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **C&C Communication**: Establishing a reliable C&C channel is crucial for any APT group to maintain control over the compromised system, receive updates, and issue new commands. Using HTTP and TCP protocols for this purpose is common due to their ubiquity and the ease with which such traffic can blend in with normal network activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Aria-body backdoor's initial data collection suggests the attackers are in the early stages of compromise.
   - Executing additional commands would logically follow to deepen the compromise or prepare for further malicious activities.
   - Establishing a C&C channel using HTTP and TCP protocols would be a subsequent step to maintain control and issue further commands.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the typical progression of APT attacks and the specific actions described, it is reasonable to assume that after collecting initial information, the Naikon APT group would indeed execute additional commands to further their objectives before or as part of establishing a C&C channel for ongoing communication.
