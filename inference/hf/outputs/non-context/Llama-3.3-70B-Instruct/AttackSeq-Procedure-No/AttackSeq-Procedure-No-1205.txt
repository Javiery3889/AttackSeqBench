To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the Sunburst backdoor and its communication with its Command and Control (C2) server.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with a supply-chain attack targeting SolarWinds, leading to the delivery of the Sunburst backdoor. This backdoor is designed to establish a foothold within the target network, allowing for further malicious activities.

2. **Communication with C2 Server**: After the initial access is achieved, the Sunburst backdoor is expected to communicate with its C2 server. This communication is crucial for the attackers to issue commands, exfiltrate data, and potentially deploy additional malware.

Given these steps, the question asks whether it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol **before** the initial access is achieved.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Initial Access Achievement**: The initial access is achieved when the Sunburst backdoor is successfully delivered and executed within the target environment. At this point, the backdoor has not yet communicated with the C2 server as part of its post-exploitation activities.
- **C2 Communication**: The communication with the C2 server is a post-exploitation activity. It occurs after the initial access has been established, as the backdoor needs to be present and running within the target environment to initiate this communication.
- **Protocol Usage**: The use of a specific protocol for C2 communication is a detail that pertains to the implementation of the backdoor and the design of the C2 infrastructure. However, the critical aspect is that such communication is expected to occur after the backdoor has been deployed and is operational within the target network.

**Conclusion**: Given the sequence of events, it is not likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol **before** the initial access is achieved. The initial access must be established first, allowing the backdoor to be deployed and become operational. Only then can it initiate communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B**
