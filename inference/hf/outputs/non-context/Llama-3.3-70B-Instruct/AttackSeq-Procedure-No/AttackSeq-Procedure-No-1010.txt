To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described Defense Evasion tactic.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with the delivery of payloads through malicious documents. This is a common initial access vector where attackers use social engineering tactics to trick users into opening malicious documents, which then execute malicious code.

2. **Execution**: The malicious code execution is facilitated by enabling macros within these documents. Once macros are enabled, the malicious code can execute, leading to the execution of files in randomly named directories. This step indicates that the attacker has gained the ability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.

3. **Defense Evasion**: The question then asks about the likelihood of the attackers disabling driver signing verification by tampering with several Registry keys before loading a rootkit driver component. Disabling driver signing verification would allow the attackers to load unsigned drivers, which could be malicious. This is a common Defense Evasion tactic because it enables attackers to introduce malicious kernel-mode code (like a rootkit) without being detected by operating system protections that normally require drivers to be signed.

Given the context:
- The attackers have already demonstrated the ability to execute malicious code on the system.
- They are attempting to load a rootkit driver component, which is typically used for persistence and evasion.
- Disabling driver signing verification is a known tactic used by attackers to load malicious drivers without detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The attackers have successfully executed malicious code, indicating they have control over the system to some extent.
2. **Need for Defense Evasion**: To maintain access and avoid detection, especially when introducing a rootkit, attackers would need to employ Defense Evasion tactics.
3. **Plausibility of Disabling Driver Signing**: Given the goal of loading a rootkit, which often requires kernel-level access, disabling driver signing verification is a plausible step. It aligns with known tactics used by attackers to evade detection.

**Conclusion**: Considering the steps outlined and the tactics commonly used by attackers, it is likely that campaigns would disable driver signing verification as part of their Defense Evasion tactics to load a rootkit driver component without being detected.
