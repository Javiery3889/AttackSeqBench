To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the behavior of SideCopy and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence involving initial access through malicious LNK files, followed by a complex delivery mechanism, and ultimately leading to the deployment of njRAT malware for credential harvesting. It asks whether SideCopy, in this context, is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying the njRAT malware.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned or implied include:
   - Initial Access: Malicious LNK files are used to gain initial access, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Phishing" or "Spearphishing Attachment" techniques.
   - Execution: The delivery of payloads via a convoluted infection chain suggests techniques like "Command and Scripting Interpreter" or "Obfuscated Files or Information."
   - Credential Harvesting: The deployment of njRAT malware for credential harvesting aligns with techniques like "Credential Dumping" or "Input Capture."

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Mouse Movement Capture and API Hooking**: These activities are more aligned with techniques aimed at gathering more detailed information about the victim's interactions or monitoring and controlling the system. Mouse movement capture could be related to "Input Capture," and API hooking could be related to "Hooking" or "API Hooking" for intercepting and manipulating system calls.
   - **SideCopy and njRAT**: SideCopy is known for its use in delivering various payloads, including remote access trojans (RATs) like njRAT. njRAT is capable of a wide range of malicious activities, including credential harvesting, which is the stated goal in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand that the primary goal mentioned is credential harvesting using njRAT.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that while mouse movement capture and API hooking could be useful for an attacker, they are not directly necessary for the stated goal of credential harvesting.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the nature of SideCopy and njRAT. SideCopy is a loader that can deliver various payloads, and njRAT is a RAT capable of multiple functions, including those that might involve capturing input or hooking APIs for broader system control and information gathering.
   - **Step 4**: Determine the likelihood of these actions based on the goal. While possible, the question focuses on the deployment of njRAT for credential harvesting, suggesting that the primary actions would be those directly supporting this goal.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Given the focus on credential harvesting and the capabilities of njRAT, it's plausible that SideCopy could facilitate the deployment of njRAT, which might then perform actions like capturing mouse movements or API hooking as part of its broader capabilities. However, the question's context suggests these actions are not the primary focus before deploying njRAT.

**Final Answer: A**
