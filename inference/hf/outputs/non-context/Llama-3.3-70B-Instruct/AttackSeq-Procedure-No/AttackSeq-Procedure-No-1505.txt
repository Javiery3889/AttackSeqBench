To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involved, considering the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the use of RIG Exploit Kit (EK), which is known for its role in exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access to a system.
   - It talks about the exploit server returning encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm. This indicates an effort to establish an encrypted channel, which is a technique used for command and control (C2) operations, aiming to hide the communication between the compromised system and the command and control server.
   - The question asks whether proxy servers will likely be used within this infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of encryption (in this case, a custom RC4 algorithm) for C2 communications is a technique (T1043: Commonly Used Port or T1573: Encrypted Channel) to evade detection.
   - Proxy servers can be used as part of the C2 infrastructure to further obscure the source of the C2 server, making it harder for defenders to track and block the malicious traffic. This aligns with techniques like T1090: Proxy, where proxies are used to hide the true destination of the C2 communications.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial exploitation and establishment of an encrypted channel indicate a sophisticated attack aiming to maintain stealth.
   - **Step 2**: The use of encryption for C2 suggests the attackers are interested in evading detection.
   - **Step 3**: Given the effort to remain undetected, using proxy servers as part of the C2 infrastructure would be a logical next step to further obscure the attack, making it consistent with observed TTPs in similar attacks.
   - **Conclusion**: Considering the attackers' apparent interest in stealth and evasion, it is reasonable to conclude that proxy servers would be used to make infections harder to detect.

**Final Answer: A**
