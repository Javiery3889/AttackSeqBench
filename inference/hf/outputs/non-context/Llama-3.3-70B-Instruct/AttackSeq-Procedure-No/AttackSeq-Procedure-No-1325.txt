To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with malware like Sayad, in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The question implies that the Sayad malware has already gained access to the system and is executing its payload, which includes data exfiltration. This suggests that the initial access and execution phases have been completed.

2. **Data Exfiltration**: The malware exfiltrates collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server. This action aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves transferring data from the compromised system to an external system under the adversary's control.

3. **Discovery**: The question mentions "discovery by collecting system and application details from the compromised host." This aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves the adversary attempting to gather information about the system, network, or application. Techniques under this tactic include System Information Discovery (T1018) and Application Window Discovery (T1010), among others.

4. **Capturing Screenshots**: Capturing screenshots is a technique that can be used for data collection and is categorized under the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the technique "Screen Capture (T1113)". This technique involves capturing the screen of the compromised system, which can reveal sensitive information.

Given the sequence described:
- The malware has already exfiltrated data, indicating it has moved beyond initial access and is in the phase of collecting and extracting valuable information.
- The next step mentioned is "discovery by collecting system and application details," which is a logical step for an adversary to understand the environment better before deciding what specific data to collect next.
- Capturing screenshots as part of data collection efforts would logically follow after the adversary has gathered enough information about the system and applications to know what to look for or to confirm the presence of specific applications or data.

Therefore, it is plausible that after exfiltrating initial data, the malware would proceed with discovery to better understand the system and then capture screenshots as part of its targeted data collection efforts.
