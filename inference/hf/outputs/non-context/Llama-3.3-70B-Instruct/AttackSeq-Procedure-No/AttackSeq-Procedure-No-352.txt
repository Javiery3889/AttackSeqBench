To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware, particularly those related to the MSIL/Crimson malware.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, to drop a malware downloader. This is a common initial access vector, where attackers use exploits to gain initial footholds into a system.

2. **Execution of Malware (MSIL/Crimson)**: After the initial access, the MSIL/Crimson malware is executed. Malware often executes in stages, with the initial stage typically being responsible for establishing persistence, gathering system information, and setting up communication channels with command and control (C2) servers.

3. **Execution of Native Windows Functions**: The question mentions the execution of native Windows functions such as `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo`. These functions are commonly used by malware to gather information about the system, such as the presence of specific files, system architecture, and other details that can help in deciding the next steps of the attack. `GetFileAttributesW` can be used to check for the existence of files or directories, while `GetSystemInfo` provides information about the system's processor architecture, which can be crucial for determining whether to deploy 32-bit or 64-bit malware components.

4. **Establishing Command and Control (C2)**: Finally, the malware establishes a C2 channel using a custom TCP protocol. This is a typical step for malware to communicate with its C2 servers, receive further instructions, and exfiltrate data.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common TTPs observed in malware attacks:
- The initial exploitation and malware drop are standard methods for gaining access.
- The use of system information gathering functions like `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo` is consistent with malware attempting to understand its environment before deciding on further actions.
- Establishing a C2 channel is a necessary step for the malware to receive commands and potentially exfiltrate data.

Therefore, it is plausible that the MSIL/Crimson malware would execute native Windows functions to gather system information before establishing a C2 channel, as this sequence of actions supports the malware's need to understand its operating environment and communicate with its operators.
