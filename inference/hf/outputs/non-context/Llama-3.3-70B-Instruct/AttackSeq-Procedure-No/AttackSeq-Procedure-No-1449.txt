To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Initial Access**: The adversary starts by sending emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT. This is a common phishing tactic aimed at gaining initial access to a target network. The use of themed attachments and links is a well-documented TTP, often associated with the "Phishing" technique (T1566) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Execution and Persistence**: After initial access, the next logical steps for an adversary would involve executing malicious code and establishing persistence within the compromised environment. The mention of ENVYSCOUT, which could be a piece of malware or a tool used for malicious purposes, suggests that the adversary is attempting to execute code (T1204) and possibly establish command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: The development of Virtual Private Server (VPS) infrastructure to host malware C2s is a common technique used by adversaries to manage their operations. This involves setting up servers that can communicate with compromised hosts, allowing the adversary to issue commands and receive stolen data. Using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts aligns with the "Server" technique under "Command and Control" (T1567) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary may use existing infrastructure for C2 communications.

Given these considerations:

- The initial phishing attempt is a common method for gaining access.
- The use of malware (like ENVYSCOUT) for execution and potential persistence is consistent with known TTPs.
- Establishing C2 communications through compromised infrastructure, such as webservers, to host delivery scripts for malware is a logical next step for an adversary seeking to maintain access and control over compromised systems.

Therefore, it is plausible that after gaining initial access, an adversary would develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s and use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts as part of their attack sequence.
