To address this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the plausibility of the scenario described:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions gaining initial access. According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, initial access involves the attacker successfully establishing a foothold within the network. This can be achieved through various means, including phishing emails (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment, T1566 - Phishing) and exploiting vulnerabilities in remote desktop protocols (T1076 - Remote Desktop Protocol).

2. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Remote Desktop Protocols**: This is a recognized method for gaining initial access, especially if the vulnerabilities are not patched. Attackers often scan for open RDP ports and attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities to gain access.

3. **Phishing Emails from Genuine Accounts**: Using phishing emails, especially those originating from genuine accounts within a client's supply chain, is a sophisticated tactic. This could involve compromised accounts (T1078 - Valid Accounts) being used to send spearphishing emails to targets, making the emails appear more legitimate and increasing the likelihood of success.

4. **Reconnaissance Activities**: After gaining initial access, attackers often conduct reconnaissance to understand the network layout, identify valuable data, and plan further actions. This can involve various techniques, including network service scanning (T1046) and system network configuration discovery (T1016).

5. **Exfiltration of Sensitive Data**: Finally, the exfiltration of sensitive data, especially in the context of ransomware attacks, is a common goal. Attackers may use various methods to exfiltrate data, including transferring data to cloud accounts (T1567 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage) or using file transfer protocols (T1041 - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel).

Given the sequence described:
- The attackers first exploit vulnerabilities in remote desktop protocols as part of reconnaissance activities. This seems slightly misordered, as exploiting RDP would typically be a method of gaining initial access rather than a reconnaissance activity. However, it's plausible that initial access is gained through one means, and then vulnerabilities in RDP are exploited for further internal movement or to establish additional access points.
- Then, they use phishing emails originating from genuine accounts within a client's supply chain for gaining initial access. This seems to imply a second wave of attacks or an alternative method of gaining access, possibly targeting different segments of the network or as a fallback if the initial method fails.

Considering the above points, the scenario described in the question seems somewhat complex and involves multiple methods of gaining initial access and conducting attacks. However, in the context of real-world attacks, it's entirely plausible for attackers to use multiple vectors for initial access, including both technical exploits and social engineering tactics like phishing, especially when those phishing attempts are made more credible by originating from compromised, genuine accounts within a supply chain.

Therefore, while the sequence might seem a bit unconventional in how it's described, the use of these tactics in combination is well within the realm of possibility for sophisticated attackers.
