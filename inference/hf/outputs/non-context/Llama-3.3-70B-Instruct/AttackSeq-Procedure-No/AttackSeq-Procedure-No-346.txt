To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the given information in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The malware has already executed a command (`cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`) to gather system information and process lists. This action can be mapped to the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques such as T1018 (Remote System Discovery) and T1057 (Process Discovery).
   - The question asks if it's likely that the malware will use a SOCK5 proxy between infected hosts for its command and control (C2) operations. This would fall under the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically technique T1090 (Proxy).

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: Using a SOCK5 proxy for C2 operations is a common technique used by adversaries to anonymize their traffic, making it harder to detect and track their activities. Given that the malware has already started gathering information about the system and processes, it's plausible that the next step would involve establishing a covert channel for C2. This aligns with the typical progression of an attack where, after initial discovery, an adversary would seek to maintain access and control.
   - **Option B (No)**: While it's possible that the malware might not use a SOCK5 proxy, given the context that the malware is already engaged in discovery activities, it's less likely. The use of proxies is a common TTP for hiding C2 communications, making option B less plausible in the context of a sophisticated or moderately complex attack scenario.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the current TTPs - The malware has performed system and process discovery.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the next logical steps in an attack sequence - After discovery, establishing a reliable and covert C2 channel is a common next step.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the use of a SOCK5 proxy in C2 operations - It's a known technique for anonymizing traffic and is consistent with the tactics of maintaining access and evading detection.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the typical progression of an attack, using a SOCK5 proxy for C2 operations is a plausible next step after the initial discovery phase.

Final Answer: A
