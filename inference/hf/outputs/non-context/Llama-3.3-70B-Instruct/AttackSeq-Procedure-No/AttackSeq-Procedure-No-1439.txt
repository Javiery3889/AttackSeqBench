To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence in the context of the StellarParticle campaign.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions the use of web session cookies for credential access to cloud resources.
   - It then inquires about the likelihood of stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware (like TrailBlazer) for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) persistence.

2. **Identifying TTPs:**
   - **Credential Access via Web Session Cookies:** This involves using stolen web session cookies to access cloud resources without needing the actual credentials, leveraging the session's validity.
   - **Credential Hopping:** This technique involves moving laterally within a network by exploiting a set of credentials to gain access to other systems or resources.
   - **Configuring Malware for WMI Persistence:** This involves setting up malware to maintain persistence on a compromised system through WMI, allowing for continued access and control.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The sequence described starts with accessing cloud resources using web session cookies, indicating an initial foothold.
   - Credential hopping is then mentioned, which would be a logical next step to expand access within the network.
   - Configuring malware for WMI persistence follows, ensuring that the attackers can maintain their access.
   - Finally, stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations is considered, which could be a method to further expand access, especially to cloud or web-based services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Expansion:** The campaign starts with a focused access method (web session cookies for cloud resources) and then expands through credential hopping, indicating a desire to broaden their access within the network.
   - **Persistence:** The use of malware like TrailBlazer for WMI persistence shows an intent to maintain long-term access to compromised systems.
   - **Further Expansion:** Stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations could be a subsequent step to gain access to additional cloud resources or services that the end-users have access to, further expanding their reach.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical progression from initial access, to lateral movement, to persistence, and then to further expansion, the sequence described seems plausible for a sophisticated campaign like StellarParticle.
   - Therefore, it is likely that after establishing a foothold and ensuring persistence, the campaign would seek to expand its access through additional means, such as stealing web session cookies.
