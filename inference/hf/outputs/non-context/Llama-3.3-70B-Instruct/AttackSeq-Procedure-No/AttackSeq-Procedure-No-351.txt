To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, to drop a malware downloader. This is a common initial access vector, where attackers use exploits to gain initial footholds into a system.

2. **Execution**: After the initial access, the MSIL/Crimson malware is executed. This step involves the malware being run on the victim's system, which is a typical next step after gaining access.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: Establishing C2 is crucial for the malware to receive further instructions and to exfiltrate data. Using a custom TCP protocol for C2 communication is plausible as it allows the attackers to maintain stealth and evade detection by traditional signature-based security systems.

4. **Downloading Additional Malware**: Attempting to download the full Remote Access Trojan (RAT) component from a specified IP address and port (213.136.87[.]122:10001) is consistent with the behavior of malware that seeks to expand its capabilities on a compromised system. RATs provide attackers with extensive control over the victim's system, enabling a wide range of malicious activities.

Given these steps, the sequence described aligns well with common TTPs observed in malware campaigns:
- **Initial Access** through exploitation,
- **Execution** of the dropped malware,
- **Establishment of Command and Control** for further instructions, and
- **Downloading** of additional malicious components to enhance control and capabilities.

Therefore, the sequence of events described in the question follows a logical and commonly observed pattern in cyber attacks, making it plausible.
