To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the plausibility of the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Discovery and Information Gathering**: The initial step involves using `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to gather system information. This is a common technique used by attackers to understand the environment they are operating in, including running processes and system details. This information can be crucial for planning subsequent steps in the attack.

2. **Data Exfiltration**: The gathered information is then sent to `45.124.132.127`, which suggests that the attacker is exfiltrating data to a command and control (C2) server. This is a typical behavior where attackers collect valuable information from the compromised system and send it back to their servers for analysis.

3. **Encryption and Encoding of C2 Data**: The question then posits that the malware will encrypt the C2 data, convert it into a hexadecimal representation, and then encode it into base64 before contacting another domain for further operations. 
   - **Encryption** of C2 data is a common practice to protect the communication between the compromised host and the C2 server from being intercepted and understood by defenders.
   - **Conversion to hexadecimal** could be a step in the data processing or encoding scheme, though it's less commonly highlighted as a standalone step in CTI reports.
   - **Base64 encoding** is frequently used to encode binary data (like encrypted data) into a text format that can be easily transmitted over text-based protocols (e.g., HTTP, SMTP) without being corrupted or misinterpreted.

4. **Contacting Another Domain for Further Operations**: Finally, the malware contacts `marina-info.net` for further operations. This could involve receiving additional commands, downloading more malware, or exfiltrating more data.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility:

- The initial information gathering and data exfiltration steps are very common in cyber attacks.
- The encryption and encoding of C2 data for secure communication is also a standard practice.
- The specific sequence of encrypting data, converting it to hexadecimal, and then encoding it in base64 before contacting another domain for further operations is technically plausible and aligns with efforts to obscure and protect C2 communications.

Therefore, considering the common practices in malware operations and the efforts to maintain stealthy and secure communication, the described sequence of TTPs is plausible.
