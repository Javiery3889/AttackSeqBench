To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Reconnaissance and Internal Scanning**: The initial step involves using reconnaissance tools within custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation. This aligns with the Discovery phase, where attackers gather information about the target environment.

2. **Abuse of OAuth Access Tokens**: The next step mentioned is the abuse of OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts. This action can be associated with the Credential Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers obtain credentials that can be used to access systems, data, or services.

3. **Lateral Movement via RDP**: Finally, the question mentions moving laterally to a Windows server via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) in the Lateral Movement phase. This is a common technique used by attackers to expand their access within a network after gaining initial access.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after the initial reconnaissance and exploitation, UNC1945 would indeed abuse OAuth access tokens to access email accounts and then move laterally to a Windows server via RDP. This sequence aligns with a plausible attack scenario where an attacker:
  1. Gathers information and exploits vulnerabilities (Discovery).
  2. Uses obtained credentials or access tokens to access sensitive data or systems (Credential Access).
  3. Moves laterally within the network to achieve further objectives (Lateral Movement).

- **B: No**: This choice implies that UNC1945 would not follow the described sequence of actions, which seems less likely given the context of the question that outlines a specific and logical sequence of attack vectors.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The question outlines a specific sequence of TTPs starting with reconnaissance and internal scanning.
2. The abuse of OAuth access tokens for gaining access to email accounts is a plausible next step for expanding access within a target environment.
3. Lateral movement via RDP to a Windows server is a common technique used after initial access is gained.

**Final Answer**: A
