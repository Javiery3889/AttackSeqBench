To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied and evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice based on the context provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers are attempting to bypass security measures, specifically mentioning the verification of victims' credentials in real-time and the request for a 2-step verification code. This suggests the attackers are engaged in a phishing campaign that involves interacting with potential victims to obtain additional verification information. The question then asks if the attackers will use images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial TTP involves phishing to obtain credentials.
   - The next step mentioned is the verification of these credentials in real-time and prompting for a 2-step verification code, indicating an attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   - The final step in question involves potentially using images instead of text in phishing emails.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Using images instead of text in phishing emails** is a known technique used by attackers to evade text-based detection mechanisms. Many email security systems rely on analyzing the text content of emails to identify phishing attempts. By using images, attackers can potentially bypass these systems since image analysis is more complex and may not be as effectively monitored.
   - Given that the attackers are already engaged in sophisticated tactics like real-time credential verification and attempting to bypass 2-step verification, it's plausible they would also employ evasion techniques like using images in phishing emails to avoid detection by Google's security systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers are sophisticated, as indicated by their real-time verification and MFA bypass attempts.
   - Using images instead of text is a known evasion technique that aligns with the goal of avoiding detection by security systems.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that such attackers might use images in phishing emails as part of their tactics to evade security measures.

**Final Answer: A**
