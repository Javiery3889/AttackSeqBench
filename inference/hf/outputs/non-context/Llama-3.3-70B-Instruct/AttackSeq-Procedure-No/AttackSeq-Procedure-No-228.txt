To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the actor retrieving encrypted commands from its command and control (C2) server for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes an initial attack sequence where obfuscated VBA-Macro functions are used to decode JavaScript payloads. This is a common technique used by attackers to evade detection by traditional security software.
   - The decoded JavaScript payloads then drop a file into the system's temporary directory. This action suggests the attacker is attempting to establish a foothold within the system.
   - The question asks if it's likely that the actor will retrieve encrypted commands from its C2 server for follow-on actions, specifically mentioning cryptocurrency mining.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Obfuscated VBA-Macro functions decoding JavaScript payloads** indicate a sophisticated attack aiming to bypass security controls. This level of sophistication often involves a structured approach to maintaining access and executing further malicious activities.
   - **Dropping a file into the system's temporary directory** can be a precursor to various malicious activities, including establishing persistence, escalating privileges, or downloading additional malware.
   - **Retrieving encrypted commands from a C2 server** is a common practice for attackers to maintain control over compromised systems without being detected. It allows for dynamic adjustment of the attack strategy, including deploying additional payloads for activities like cryptocurrency mining.
   - **Cryptocurrency mining** as a follow-on action is plausible because it represents a direct monetary benefit to the attacker. Once an attacker has established access to a system, using its resources for cryptocurrency mining is a relatively low-risk way to generate revenue.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial steps described (obfuscation, payload deployment, and file dropping) are indicative of a targeted and potentially sophisticated attack.
   - The use of encryption for C2 communications is standard practice to evade detection.
   - Cryptocurrency mining is a common payload for compromised systems due to its potential for direct financial gain.
   - Given the initial investment in evading detection and establishing a foothold, it is reasonable to assume the attacker would seek to maximize the value extracted from the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A**
