To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described order of events based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, as well as the characteristics of the tools and vulnerabilities mentioned.

1. **Initial Access via Exploitation of Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882):** The attackers start by exploiting a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-11882) to gain initial access. This vulnerability allows them to execute arbitrary code when a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Word file. This step is about gaining a foothold in the system.

2. **Establishing Persistence:** After gaining initial access, a common next step for attackers is to establish persistence. This means they want to ensure they can maintain access to the system even after the initial exploit is closed or the system is restarted. Writing itself to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry are methods to achieve persistence. The script in `%AppData%` could be set to run every time the user logs in or when a specific application (like Microsoft Word) is launched, and the run key in the registry is a common method for ensuring executables or scripts run at startup or user logon.

3. **Deploying the PowerShell Backdoor (POWERSHOWER):** The deployment of a backdoor, such as POWERSHOWER, is typically a step taken after initial access has been gained and often after some form of persistence has been established. A backdoor provides the attackers with a covert channel to access the system, execute commands, and potentially exfiltrate data or move laterally within the network.

Given these steps, the question asks whether it is likely that the attackers would establish persistence before deploying the PowerShell backdoor. 

- **Establishing persistence** is a crucial step for maintaining access and ensuring that any subsequent tools or backdoors deployed can be used effectively even if the initial exploit is patched or the system is restarted.
- **Deploying a backdoor** like POWERSHOWER would logically follow the establishment of persistence, as it provides a reliable means for the attackers to return to the system and execute further malicious activities.

Therefore, it is logical and consistent with known TTPs that attackers would establish persistence mechanisms before deploying additional tools like a backdoor. This ensures that they can reliably reconnect to the system and use the backdoor for further malicious activities.
