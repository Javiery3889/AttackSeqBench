To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) like The Darkhotel APT.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by The Darkhotel APT, starting with the deployment of a keylogger module for input capture. This action is aimed at capturing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other sensitive data typed by the victim. The mention of encrypting and storing gathered data in log files suggests an attempt to securely collect and possibly exfiltrate this sensitive information.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with input capture (using a keylogger), followed by the potential use of an information stealer module. The information stealer module is specifically mentioned to target stored secrets in browsers and email services, which aligns with the goal of obtaining victim credentials.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Input Capture (T1056)**: This technique involves capturing user input, which can include keystrokes. The use of a keylogger fits this technique.
   - **Credential Dumping (T1003)**: This involves obtaining credentials from the operating system or software. Targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services can be considered a form of credential dumping.
   - The sequence described (input capture followed by targeting stored secrets) is plausible for an APT group aiming to gather as much sensitive information as possible from a compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The Darkhotel APT deploys a keylogger, indicating an interest in capturing sensitive information directly from user input.
   - **Step 2**: The mention of encrypting and storing gathered data suggests a methodical approach to collecting and possibly exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - **Step 3**: Utilizing an information stealer module to target stored secrets in browsers and email services is a logical next step to gather more credentials or sensitive information that might not be captured through keylogging alone.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the sequence of actions and the typical goals of APT groups like The Darkhotel, it is reasonable to conclude that they would indeed attempt to gain victim credentials using the information stealer module after deploying a keylogger. This approach maximizes the amount of sensitive information that can be gathered from a compromised system.
