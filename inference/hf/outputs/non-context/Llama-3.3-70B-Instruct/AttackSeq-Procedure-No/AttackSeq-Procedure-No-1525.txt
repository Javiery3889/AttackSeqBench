To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Exposing the malware controller on a port**: This action suggests that the threat actors are setting up a command and control (C2) channel. This is a common technique (T1043: Commonly Used Port) where attackers use a listening port to receive commands from a remote server, allowing them to control compromised systems.

2. **Administer commands to infections**: This implies that the threat actors are using the established C2 channel to send commands to compromised systems. This aligns with techniques like T1104: Multiband Communication and T1071: Application Window Discovery, where attackers interact with compromised systems to execute commands.

3. **Access the server via panel login, SSH, or RDP**: After setting up a C2 channel, accessing the server through standard administrative interfaces like login panels, Secure Shell (SSH), or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) could be part of the post-exploitation phase. Techniques like T1078: Valid Accounts (for legitimate login methods) and T1110: Brute Force (if attempting to guess passwords) are relevant here.

4. **Acquiring a server through compromise or legitimate purchase and tuning configurations**: This step involves either compromising an existing server (through exploits, phishing, etc.) or purchasing one legally and then configuring it for malicious use. This could involve techniques like T1583: Acquire Infrastructure (for purchasing or renting infrastructure) and T1484: Domain Policy Modification (for tuning configurations to suit the attacker's needs).

Given these steps, the question essentially asks if it's plausible that after setting up a C2 channel, threat actors would access the server through standard administrative means only after they have acquired and configured the server. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

- **Setting up a C2 channel** is a common practice for controlling compromised systems.
- **Accessing the server** through standard means like panel login, SSH, or RDP after setup is plausible for further configuration or exploitation.
- **Acquiring a server** and then using it for malicious purposes, including setting up a C2 channel, fits within known TTPs of threat actors.

**Conclusion**: Given the logical sequence of setting up a C2 channel, accessing the server for further configuration or exploitation, and the context of acquiring and using a server for malicious purposes, it is indeed likely that threat actors would follow such a sequence. This aligns with known tactics and techniques used in cyber attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
