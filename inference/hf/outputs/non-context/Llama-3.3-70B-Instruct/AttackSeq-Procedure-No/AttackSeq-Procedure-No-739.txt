To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the Elderwood Project.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence where command and control (C&C) servers are established. This implies that the attackers have already gained access to the target systems. The question then asks if, after this point, the Elderwood Project attackers would deploy zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - Establishing C&C servers: This is typically a step taken after initial access has been gained, to maintain control over compromised systems and to issue commands.
   - Deploying zero-day exploits: This is a method used to gain initial access, especially through watering hole attacks, which involve compromising a website frequently visited by individuals from a specific industry or sector to infect their devices.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Establishing C&C servers** is a post-exploitation tactic (according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this falls under Command and Control, which is a tactic used after initial access has been achieved).
   - **Deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks** is a method used for initial access (under the Initial Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

Given this sequence, the question seems to suggest a reverse order of operations. Typically, attackers would first use zero-day exploits to gain initial access (possibly through watering hole attacks), and then establish C&C servers to maintain their foothold.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Elderwood Project is known for its sophisticated attacks, including the use of zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks to gain initial access.
   - The establishment of C&C servers is a post-initial access tactic, used to maintain control and issue commands to compromised systems.
   - The question posits a scenario where C&C servers are already established, implying initial access has been achieved, and then asks if zero-day exploits would be deployed to gain initial access, which seems out of sequence.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the typical sequence of attack operations, it does not make sense for attackers to establish C&C servers first and then attempt to gain initial access. Initial access must be gained before C&C can be established. Therefore, the scenario described in the question does not align with typical attack sequences.

**Final Answer: B**
