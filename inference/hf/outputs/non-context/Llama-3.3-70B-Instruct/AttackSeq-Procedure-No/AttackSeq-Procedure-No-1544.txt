To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate their logical progression in the context of a cyber attack.

1. **Achieving Persistence**: The malware creates a RunOnce key in the registry. This is a technique used by attackers to maintain persistence on a compromised system, ensuring that their malware runs at least once after a reboot. This action aligns with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder" technique.

2. **Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**: The next step mentioned is the enumeration of AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances. This action falls under the "Discovery" tactic, aiming to gather information about the target environment, which could include cloud services. Enumerating cloud infrastructure could provide valuable information for further exploitation or lateral movement.

3. **Establishing Command and Control (C2)**: The final step involves establishing C2 communication through "Process Hollowing." Process Hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is spawned, and its memory is replaced with malicious code, allowing the attacker to hide their communication within a legitimate process. This technique is associated with the "Defense Evasion" tactic but is also crucial for establishing a covert C2 channel, which is essential for the "Command and Control" tactic.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- **Persistence** is a common initial step after gaining access to ensure continued presence on the system.
- **Cloud Infrastructure Discovery** could logically follow if the attacker's goals include exploiting or moving laterally within the cloud environment. Knowing the layout of the cloud infrastructure would be beneficial for planning the next steps.
- **Establishing C2 through Process Hollowing** is a sophisticated method to communicate with the compromised system without being detected, which aligns with the goals of maintaining access and potentially exfiltrating data or executing further malicious activities.

Considering the logical progression of these TTPs, it is plausible that after achieving persistence, an attacker would seek to understand the broader environment (including cloud infrastructure) before establishing a secure and covert means of command and control. This sequence aligns with a sophisticated attack pattern where the adversary seeks to maximize their understanding of the target environment before proceeding with further exploitation.
