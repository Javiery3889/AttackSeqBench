To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by the Turla malware. First, it establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks for persistence. This implies the malware is using techniques to maintain its presence within the network without being detected. Then, it mentions the use of a rootkit for defense evasion after the operators download specialized tools like password stealers for the collection phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Persistence**: Establishing a hidden foothold.
   - **Collection**: Downloading specialized tools (like password stealers) to gather sensitive information.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Using a rootkit to conceal the spying operation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The question essentially asks if the use of a rootkit for defense evasion is likely to occur after the collection phase has started (with the download of password stealers), as a means to continue concealing the operation.
   - Typically, defense evasion techniques, including the use of rootkits, can be employed at various stages of an attack to maintain access and avoid detection. The use of a rootkit to hide the malware's presence can indeed be crucial after the malware has established itself and is engaged in sensitive activities like data collection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Establishing Persistence**: The malware first needs to ensure it can remain in the system without being detected.
   - **Collection**: The next step involves gathering sensitive information, which could include downloading additional tools.
   - **Defense Evasion**: To continue operating undetected, especially after downloading and using tools that might increase the risk of detection (like password stealers), employing a rootkit for defense evasion makes sense. This would help in concealing the malware's activities, including the collection of sensitive information.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the logical progression of establishing a foothold, collecting sensitive information, and then taking additional measures to avoid detection, it is plausible that the malware would include a rootkit for defense evasion after its operators have started the collection phase. This would help maintain the covert nature of the operation.
