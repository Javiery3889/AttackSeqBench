To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the typical behaviors associated with malware, particularly focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via USB Flash Drives**: The use of USB flash drives for initial access is a known TTP, often associated with malware like BadUSB or other malicious payloads designed to infect systems upon insertion of the USB device. This aligns with the "Drive-by Compromise" (T1091) or "Spearphishing via Removable Media" (T1091, though more commonly associated with spearphishing) techniques under the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Execution of an EXE File**: After initial access, the execution of an EXE file is a common method for malware to establish a foothold on a system. This could be related to the "User Execution" (T1204) technique, where the malware relies on a user to execute it, or "Windows Management Instrumentation" (T1047) if the EXE is executed through WMI, among other possibilities.

3. **Downloading Additional Files**: Malware often downloads additional files or payloads to enhance its capabilities, gather more information, or prepare for further stages of the attack. This behavior aligns with the "Inhibit System Recovery" (T1490), though more directly related would be techniques under "Command and Control" like "Data Staging" (T1074) or specifically downloading tools under "Tool" (T1204, with sub-techniques).

4. **Execution as a DLL File**: The execution of malware as a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file is a technique used to evade detection and blend in with legitimate system processes. This could relate to "Dynamic Link Library Search Order Hijacking" (T1055) if the malware is using a hijacked DLL search path or simply executing as a DLL to hide in plain sight.

5. **Creating a Log File to Check for USB Connections**: The creation of a log file, especially for monitoring USB connections, suggests the malware is designed to either await further instructions or payloads via USB or to monitor the system's interaction with removable media. This could be part of its persistence mechanism or a way to await updates, aligning loosely with "Data Staging" (T1074) or "Data Encoding" (T1132) if the logs are encoded, though it's more about monitoring and persistence.

Given these steps:
- The initial infection via USB aligns with known TTPs.
- The subsequent actions (executing an EXE, downloading additional files, executing as a DLL, and logging USB connections) are all plausible steps a sophisticated piece of malware might take to establish persistence, gather intelligence, and potentially await further instructions or spread.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of malware behavior post-infection and the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is indeed plausible that the malware would execute an EXE file, download additional files, execute as a DLL, and create a log file to check for USB connections during its execution phase.
