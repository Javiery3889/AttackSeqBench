To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with the deployment of worms to scan for misconfigured hosts. This is a common initial step in many attacks, aimed at identifying vulnerable targets.
   - The next step involves exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access. This technique aligns with the "Exploitation of Remote Services" (T1190) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a network or system.
   - The question then mentions deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`. This action is related to "Data Destruction" or "Data Evasion" techniques, where attackers might delete shadow copies to evade detection or destroy data. However, in the context of preparing for resource hijacking, this action seems more aligned with ensuring that any traces of malicious activity are removed, and potentially, to limit the ability of the system to recover from the attack.
   - The ultimate objective mentioned is resource hijacking through malicious container images, which aligns with "Resource Hijacking" (T1496) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an attacker compromises a system or service and uses its resources for their own purposes.

2. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - **Option A (Yes):** This option suggests that attackers will delete shadow volumes before achieving their objective of resource hijacking. Deleting shadow volumes could be a step to cover tracks and prevent system recovery, which might be beneficial for attackers aiming to maintain access and control over compromised resources without easy detection or recovery.
   - **Option B (No):** This option implies that attackers would not delete shadow volumes before hijacking resources. While attackers often aim to remain stealthy, the primary goal of resource hijacking is to utilize the compromised system's resources, not necessarily to destroy data or cover tracks immediately.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence starts with reconnaissance and initial access, which is typical.
   - The exploitation of Docker API ports for initial access is a known vulnerability exploitation technique.
   - The deletion of shadow volumes could serve multiple purposes, including evading detection and limiting system recovery options, which could be beneficial for attackers but isn't directly related to the act of resource hijacking itself.
   - The ultimate goal of resource hijacking suggests that the attackers are more interested in utilizing the system's resources than in immediately covering their tracks or destroying data.

Given the context and the steps outlined, deleting shadow volumes could be seen as a precautionary measure to limit forensic analysis and system recovery, which might be in the interest of attackers looking to hijack resources without immediate detection. However, this action is not directly necessary for the act of resource hijacking itself.

**Final Answer: A**
