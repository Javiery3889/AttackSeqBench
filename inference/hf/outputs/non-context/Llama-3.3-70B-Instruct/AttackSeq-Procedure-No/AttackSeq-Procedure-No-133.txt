To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described action.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving a backdoor (SLUB) that has capabilities for data collection, including taking screenshots, copying files, and creating archives for exfiltration. The question then asks if it's likely for this backdoor to perform discovery by downloading and parsing commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet to retrieve lines marked with specific patterns.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned include:
   - Data collection (taking screenshots, copying files, creating archives).
   - Exfiltration (transferring the collected data out of the target system).
   - Potential discovery (downloading and parsing commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The initial actions (data collection and exfiltration) are typical of a backdoor's functionality, aimed at gathering and removing sensitive information from a compromised system.
   - The action of downloading and parsing commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet for discovery involves retrieving potentially new or updated commands or configurations. This could be a method for the attackers to dynamically update the backdoor's capabilities or to receive new instructions without having to directly interact with the compromised system, which aligns with tactics used by sophisticated threat actors to maintain stealth and flexibility.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The backdoor's initial capabilities (data collection, exfiltration) suggest a focus on gathering and removing sensitive data, which is a common goal of malicious actors.
   - **Step 2**: The use of external resources like GitHub 'gist' snippets for command and control (C2) or for updating malware capabilities is a known tactic. It allows attackers to manage their operations remotely and adapt to changes in the target environment or security measures.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of a backdoor already engaged in data collection and exfiltration, extending its capabilities to include dynamic command retrieval for further discovery or action aligns with the strategic interests of the attackers. It would enable them to potentially expand their access, gather more specific data, or prepare for persistence and evasion.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that after establishing a backdoor for data collection and exfiltration, an attacker would use it to download and parse commands for further discovery or to update its capabilities. This approach fits within the broader strategy of maximizing the value of a compromised system while minimizing the risk of detection.
