To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with phishing emails containing weaponized MS Office attachments. This is a common initial access vector (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment) where the attachment, once opened and macros are enabled, installs malware. In this case, the malware installed is BlackEnergy 3, which is known for its capabilities in espionage and disruptive operations.

2. **Execution and Persistence**: By enabling macros, the BlackEnergy 3 malware is installed. This step involves executing the malware (T1204 - User Execution), which then likely establishes persistence (TA0003 - Persistence) to maintain access to the victim's system.

3. **Maintaining Remote Access**: The question mentions the use of legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access. This aligns with the technique of using valid accounts (T1078 - Valid Accounts) or remote access tools (T1219 - Remote Access Tools) to maintain access. Adversaries often use legitimate tools to blend in with normal network activity, making detection more challenging.

4. **Internal Network Reconnaissance and Credential Harvesting**: After establishing a foothold, the next logical steps for an adversary would be to conduct internal network reconnaissance (TA0007 - Discovery) to understand the network layout, identify valuable targets, and harvest credentials (T1003 - Credential Dumping) to move laterally within the network.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common adversary TTPs as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
- Initial access through phishing and malware installation.
- Use of legitimate tools for remote access.
- Conducting internal reconnaissance.
- Harvesting credentials for further movement.

Therefore, it is plausible that after gaining initial access and installing malware, an adversary would use legitimate utilities for maintaining remote access before moving on to internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
