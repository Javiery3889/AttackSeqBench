To answer this question, let's break it down step by step, analyzing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the Sednit group and the context provided:

1. **Understanding Sednit Group's TTPs**: The Sednit group, also known as APT28 or Fancy Bear, is a cyber espionage group believed to be sponsored by the Russian government. They are known for their sophisticated attacks, often targeting government, military, and critical infrastructure organizations. Their TTPs include spear-phishing campaigns, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and the use of custom malware for espionage purposes.

2. **Initial Access via Malicious Documents**: The question mentions the use of malicious documents containing VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros as a means to establish initial access. This is a common TTP for many threat actors, including the Sednit group. VBA macros can be used to execute malicious code on a victim's system when a document is opened, allowing the attackers to gain a foothold in the target network.

3. **Discovery Phase and Vulnerability Scanning**: After establishing initial access, the next logical steps for an attacker would involve the Discovery phase, where they seek to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and look for vulnerabilities to exploit. Vulnerability scanning is a key technique used during this phase to identify potential weaknesses in systems or applications that can be exploited for further access or privilege escalation.

4. **Targeting Government and Critical Infrastructure**: Given the Sednit group's known interests and targets, it is plausible that their campaigns would focus on government and critical infrastructure organizations. These entities possess sensitive information and systems that, if compromised, could provide significant strategic advantages to the attackers.

5. **IP Range Targeting for Vulnerability Scanning**: Targeting specific IP ranges related to government and critical infrastructure organizations for vulnerability scanning aligns with the Sednit group's objectives. By focusing on these IP ranges, the attackers can efficiently identify potential entry points or weaknesses in systems that are likely to yield valuable information or access.

Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the Sednit group's malware would indeed target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase, especially after launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.
