To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence in relation to the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves:
     1. Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     2. Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     3. Abusing command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
     4. Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The question essentially asks if the execution of cryptocurrency mining scripts (via abusing command interpreters) occurs after the attackers have achieved their goal of resource hijacking.
   - **Resource Hijacking** is typically associated with using a system's resources for unauthorized purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining.
   - **Cryptocurrency mining** is often a primary objective for attackers who seek to hijack system resources for financial gain.
   - The deployment of worms and exploitation of Docker API ports are initial steps aimed at gaining access to a system or network.
   - Once access is gained, the next logical steps would involve establishing a foothold, escalating privileges, and then executing the primary objective, which in this case seems to be resource hijacking for cryptocurrency mining.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Attackers deploy worms to identify vulnerable hosts, which is a reconnaissance and initial access technique.
   - **Step 2:** They exploit exposed Docker API ports, which provides them with an entry point into the system.
   - **Step 3:** After gaining access, the attackers would likely seek to establish persistence, escalate privileges, and then move towards their objective.
   - **Step 4:** The objective here is resource hijacking, which is often achieved by executing scripts or programs that utilize the system's resources for cryptocurrency mining.
   - Given this sequence, it seems more logical that the execution of cryptocurrency mining scripts (through abusing command interpreters) would be a part of achieving the resource hijacking objective rather than an action taken after achieving it.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of attack operations and the objectives outlined, it seems less likely that attackers would wait until after achieving their "ultimate objective" of resource hijacking to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts. Instead, executing these scripts would be a means to achieve that objective.

**Final Answer: B**
