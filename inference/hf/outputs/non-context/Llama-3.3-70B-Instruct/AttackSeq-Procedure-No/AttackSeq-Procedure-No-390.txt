To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where threat actors use AtomBombing, a technique that exploits Windows operating system mechanisms for code injection, allowing them to execute malicious code through legitimate programs. Following this, it questions whether it's likely for these actors to use a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script, specifically by embedding it within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial TTP mentioned is AtomBombing, which is a code injection technique. The subsequent action in question involves using a VBA script embedded in a Word document. This implies a potential sequence from code injection to possibly using social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities in office software to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **AtomBombing** is a technique that allows attackers to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. This technique is often used to evade detection and to make the malicious activity appear as part of normal system operations.
   - **Using a VBA script in a Word document** is another method to execute malicious code. This typically involves social engineering, where a victim is tricked into opening a malicious document, which then executes the VBA script, potentially leading to malware installation, data theft, or other malicious activities.

Given these points, the question essentially asks if, after using a sophisticated technique like AtomBombing for code injection, attackers would also use a VBA script embedded in a Word document as part of their attack strategy.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Recognize that AtomBombing is a technique used for injecting malicious code into legitimate processes, which is a sophisticated method indicating a certain level of expertise and possibly a targeted attack approach.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the use of VBA scripts in malicious documents. This is a common tactic used in phishing and social engineering attacks, aiming to trick users into executing malicious code.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of combining these techniques. Sophisticated attackers often use multiple vectors to achieve their goals, including both exploiting technical vulnerabilities (like using AtomBombing) and manipulating user behavior (like using VBA scripts in documents).
   - **Step 4**: Consider the goals of such attacks. If the goal is to establish a foothold in a network, gather intelligence, or exfiltrate data, using multiple TTPs increases the chances of success.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the above analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that after using a sophisticated technique like AtomBombing, threat actors might indeed use other tactics, including social engineering via VBA scripts in documents, to further their objectives. This multi-faceted approach can increase the effectiveness of their attack by targeting both technical vulnerabilities and human factors.

**Final Answer: A**
