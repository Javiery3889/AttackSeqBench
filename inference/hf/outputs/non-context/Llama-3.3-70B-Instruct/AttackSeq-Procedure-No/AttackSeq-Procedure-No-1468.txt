To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common adversary behaviors as understood through the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Credential Harvesting**: The initial step involves using BlackEnergy 3 plugins for credential harvesting to expand access across the corporate network. This is a common technique used by adversaries to gain deeper access into a network. BlackEnergy is known for its use in targeted attacks against industrial control systems and for its ability to expand its reach through credential harvesting.

2. **Extracting Names of Locally Reachable Wi-Fi Networks**: After gaining access and expanding their foothold within the network, extracting names of locally reachable Wi-Fi networks could be a logical next step for adversaries aiming to spread their influence beyond the current network. This action aligns with the technique of "Network Service Scanning" (T1046) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where adversaries scan for open ports and services to identify potential targets.

3. **Brute-Force Attack to Spread to New Networks**: Performing a brute-force attack to gain access to new networks is a plausible next step. This aligns with the "Brute Force" technique (T1110) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where adversaries attempt to guess passwords or encryption keys through rapid repeated attempts.

4. **Developing a Malicious Computer Code Update for Identified Serial-to-Ethernet Converters**: Finally, developing a malicious update for serial-to-Ethernet converters indicates a sophisticated level of attack, aiming to compromise specific devices that might not be as heavily monitored or protected as other network devices. This could be part of the "Supply Chain Compromise" (T1195) or "Exploitation for Client Execution" (T1203) techniques, depending on how the update is delivered and executed.

Given the sequence of actions:
- The initial use of BlackEnergy 3 for credential harvesting and network expansion is consistent with sophisticated threat actors.
- Extracting Wi-Fi network names and performing brute-force attacks are common techniques used for lateral movement and expanding access.
- Developing malicious code updates for specific devices like serial-to-Ethernet converters represents a targeted approach to compromise less secure devices within the network.

Considering these points, the sequence described in the question represents a plausible series of actions an adversary might take to expand their influence within and beyond the initial compromised network. Therefore, it is likely that adversaries would engage in such activities as part of a broader campaign to compromise and exploit network resources.
