To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question involves two main components:
   - The use of the `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView for remote system discovery. This is a technique associated with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the technique "T1018 - Remote System Discovery".
   - The use of the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise. SocGholish is associated with the "Initial Access" tactic, specifically under the technique "T1189 - Drive-by Compromise" or potentially "T1192 - Spearphishing via Web Application" if it involves user interaction with a compromised website.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access**: Typically, the initial access phase involves the attacker gaining an initial foothold into the network. This could be through various means, including exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications (Drive-by Compromise) or through social engineering tactics like spearphishing.
   - **Discovery**: After gaining initial access, attackers often seek to understand the environment they have accessed. This includes identifying computers, users, and other assets on the network. The `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView is a tool used for this purpose, specifically for remote system discovery.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The SocGholish framework is used for initial compromise, suggesting it's one of the first steps in the attack sequence.
   - The `Get-NetComputer` command is used for remote system discovery, which typically occurs after the attacker has gained some level of access to the network.
   - Given the nature of these TTPs, it's unlikely that an attacker would use `Get-NetComputer` for remote system discovery **before** using SocGholish for initial compromise. The logical sequence is that initial compromise (via SocGholish) happens first, followed by discovery activities (such as using `Get-NetComputer`).

**Final Answer: B**
