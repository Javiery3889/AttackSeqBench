To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Discovery**: The StellarParticle campaign's use of AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets for discovering Active Directory information indicates an initial access phase where the threat actor is gathering information about the target environment. This is consistent with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves techniques like T1069 (Permission Groups Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery).

2. **Accessing Files from OneDrive**: Accessing files from victims' OneDrive environments would be a step to gather more specific data about the target, potentially including sensitive information or credentials. This action aligns with the "Collection" tactic, specifically techniques like T1539 (Steal Web Session Cookie) if the threat actor is accessing cloud-based services, or more directly T1552 (Unsecured Credentials) and T1005 (Data from Local System) if they are looking for stored credentials or specific data.

3. **Lateral Movement Using RDP**: The use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally through the environment is a common tactic for spreading within a network after initial access has been gained. This aligns with the "Lateral Movement" tactic, specifically technique T1021 (Remote Services), where RDP is a means to access and control remote systems.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of a cyber attack:
- **Initial Access** and **Discovery** to understand the environment.
- **Collection** of specific data, which could include accessing cloud storage like OneDrive for sensitive information.
- **Lateral Movement** using compromised credentials or accounts to further infiltrate the network.

Therefore, it is plausible that after demonstrating discovery activities, the threat actor would attempt to access files from victims' OneDrive environments to gather more information or credentials, which would then be used for lateral movement via RDP.
