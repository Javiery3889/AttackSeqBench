To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario presented:

1. **Initial Access**: The campaign starts with embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain initial access to a system. The encoding of the scripts is likely used to evade detection by security software.

2. **Execution**: The encoded PowerShell scripts are executed through macro-triggered events. This means when the document is opened and macros are enabled, the scripts run, allowing the attacker to execute code on the victim's system.

3. **Defense Evasion**: The use of obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload is mentioned as part of defense evasion. Obfuscation makes it harder for security tools and analysts to understand the purpose and behavior of the malware, thereby evading detection.

4. **Persistence**: The question mentions the use of decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence. Persistence involves techniques that attackers use to keep access to a system even after the initial breach is thought to be remediated. Dropping a script like invoker.ps1 could be part of establishing persistence, as it might be used to repeatedly execute malicious code or maintain a connection to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.

Given this sequence:
- The attackers first gain access through a malicious document with encoded scripts.
- They then use obfuscation to evade defenses, which is consistent with trying to maintain access without being detected.
- Finally, they aim to establish persistence, which is a logical next step after gaining access and evading defenses.

The use of decoded scripts for persistence after employing obfuscation and evasion techniques does not contradict typical attack patterns. In fact, it aligns with the attackers' goal of maintaining access to the compromised system. The decoding of scripts for persistence could be a tactical choice based on the specific requirements of the persistence mechanism or the environment in which it's being deployed.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The initial access vector using encoded scripts in a Word document is plausible.
2. The execution via macro-triggered events is a known technique.
3. Defense evasion through obfuscation is consistent with trying to maintain access.
4. Establishing persistence through dropping scripts like invoker.ps1 after initial access and defense evasion is a logical step in the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
