To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned.

1. **Initial Contact and Malware Distribution**: The scenario begins with contacting a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware. This step is typical in many cyber attacks where the initial malware is designed to establish a foothold in the target system. Seduploader is known for its ability to download additional malware, making it a common first-stage tool in multi-stage attacks.

2. **Use of Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Technique**: The question then mentions the use of the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands. DDE is a protocol that allows data to be shared between applications, and it has been exploited by attackers to execute malicious code without needing to rely on macros, which are often disabled by security policies. The use of DDE to invoke PowerShell for executing encoded commands is a known TTP (Tactic: Execution, Technique: T1204 - User Execution, Sub-technique: T1204.002 - DDE) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Plausibility of the Sequence**: Given the context of a multi-stage command and control operation, it is plausible that after establishing an initial foothold with Seduploader, an attacker would use various techniques to further exploit the system. The use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands is a sophisticated technique that allows attackers to bypass some security controls and execute malicious code in a stealthy manner. This aligns with the goals of maintaining access, escalating privileges, and executing further malicious actions within the compromised system.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the TTPs described and the context of a multi-stage attack, it is indeed likely that the malicious document would use the Microsoft Office DDE technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands after the initial contact and distribution of the Seduploader malware. This sequence of actions is consistent with known attack patterns and the tactics, techniques, and procedures outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
