To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Exploitation of VBScript Engine Vulnerability**: The initial access vector involves exploiting a vulnerability in the VBScript engine, likely through a watering hole attack. This is a plausible initial access technique (T1193 - Spearphishing via Service), where attackers compromise a website visited by the target, exploiting vulnerabilities in the browser or its components (like the VBScript engine) to gain initial access.

2. **Disable Security Tools**: After gaining initial access, the attackers attempt to disable security tools. This is a common technique (T1562 - Impair Defenses) used by attackers to evade detection. Modifying EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) related services to disable auto-start on system reboot falls under this category, specifically technique T1562.001 (Disable or Modify Tools).

3. **Download and Execute a Backdoor**: Finally, the attackers download and execute a backdoor for further operations. This aligns with technique T1219 (Remote Access Tools), where attackers establish a persistent connection to the compromised system to facilitate further malicious activities.

Given this sequence:
- The initial exploitation for access is a known and effective method.
- Disabling security tools is a logical next step to maintain access without detection.
- Downloading and executing a backdoor provides the attackers with a persistent remote access capability, facilitating further operations such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or command and control.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access method is plausible and aligns with known attack vectors.
2. The action of disabling security tools is a common technique used to evade detection and ensure the longevity of the attack.
3. The final step of downloading and executing a backdoor is consistent with establishing a persistent presence in the compromised network.

**Conclusion**: Given the logical progression of the attack sequence and its alignment with common TTPs observed in the wild, it is indeed likely that attackers would follow this sequence to achieve their objectives.
