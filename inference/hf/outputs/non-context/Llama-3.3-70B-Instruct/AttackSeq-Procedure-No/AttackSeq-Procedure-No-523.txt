To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence as presented.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a system, as it can exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office or trick users into enabling macros, thus executing malicious code.

2. **Execution**: The mention of the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script indicates that the attacker is using PowerShell to execute commands. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of malicious activities, including downloading additional payloads.

3. **Download of Malware Payload**: The script downloading a zip file containing components for the malware payload is a plausible next step. Attackers often download additional tools or payloads after initial access to expand their capabilities within the compromised system.

4. **Decoding and Executing Base64 Encoded Script**: The decoding and execution of a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' is also a common technique. Base64 encoding is often used to hide malicious scripts or data within seemingly innocuous files (like image files), which can then be decoded and executed by a script like 'fmx.ps1'.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns with common attack patterns:
- Initial access through a malicious document.
- Use of PowerShell for execution and further payload download.
- Downloading additional malware components.
- Using encoded scripts to hide malicious activity.

Therefore, it is plausible that after gaining initial access, the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script would download a zip file containing malware payload components and then decode and execute a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' as part of the attack sequence.
