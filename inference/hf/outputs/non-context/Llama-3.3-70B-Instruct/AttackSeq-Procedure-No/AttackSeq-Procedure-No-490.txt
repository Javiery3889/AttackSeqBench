To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like FamousSparrow, in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions stealing application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links. This is a common initial access technique (T1566.001 - Phishing: Spearphishing Link) where an attacker sends a link to a victim that, when clicked, can lead to the installation of malware or the theft of credentials and access tokens.

2. **Discovery**: After gaining initial access, the next phase mentioned is collecting system information and probing files. This aligns with the Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers attempt to gather information about the system, network, and applications (e.g., T1018 - Remote System Discovery, T1083 - File and Directory Discovery).

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**, it is plausible that after gaining initial access through phishing (stealing application access tokens), a threat actor like FamousSparrow would proceed to collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase. This sequence aligns with typical attacker behavior post-initial access, where understanding the environment is crucial for further exploitation and achieving the attacker's objectives.

- **B: No**, this choice suggests that the described sequence is unlikely. However, based on common TTPs, there's no inherent reason to believe that stealing access tokens via phishing and then proceeding to discovery activities is an unlikely sequence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Phishing for initial access is a common technique.
2. Stealing application access tokens can provide attackers with the necessary credentials to move laterally within a network or access specific applications.
3. Collecting system information and probing files are standard discovery techniques used after initial access to understand the environment and plan further actions.

**Final Answer: A**
