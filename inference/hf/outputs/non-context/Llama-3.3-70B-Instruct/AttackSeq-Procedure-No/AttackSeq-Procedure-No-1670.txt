To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common attack patterns and the characteristics of the TDrop2 malware.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of activities starting with discovery, which is a common initial phase in many cyber attacks where attackers gather information about the target system or network. This is often followed by establishing Command and Control (C2) communications, which can involve using various channels, including cloud services like Google Drive, to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Discovery**: Collecting system and network information.
   - **C2 Establishment**: Using Google Drive for Command and Control.
   - **C2 Communication**: Using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet to communicate with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of cloud services like Google Drive for C2 is a known tactic (TTP) used by various malware and threat actors to blend in with legitimate traffic and evade detection.
   - Encrypting and base64-encoding commands, especially with a custom alphabet, is a technique used to obfuscate C2 communications, making them harder to detect by traditional security monitoring tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Discovery activities are common in the initial stages of an attack to understand the target environment.
   - **Step 2**: Using Google Drive or similar services for C2 is plausible as it leverages a legitimate service that is less likely to be blocked by firewalls or network security policies.
   - **Step 3**: Employing encrypted and base64-encoded commands, particularly with a custom base64 alphabet, indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis, which aligns with sophisticated C2 communication tactics.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the sequence of activities described, it is plausible that after performing discovery activities, the TDrop2 malware could use Google Drive for C2 communications and then proceed to use encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom alphabet to communicate with C2 servers. This sequence aligns with known TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors to maintain stealth and control over compromised systems.
