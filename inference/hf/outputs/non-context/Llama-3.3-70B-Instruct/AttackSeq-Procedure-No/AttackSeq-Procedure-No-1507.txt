To answer this question, let's break down the components and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involved.

1. **RIG EK (Exploit Kit)**: RIG EK is known for delivering exploits to vulnerable systems, often through malvertising or compromised websites. It typically targets vulnerabilities in web browsers and their plugins to gain initial access.

2. **Malvertising**: This involves using online advertisements to spread malware. An attacker might compromise an ad network or create malicious ads that, when clicked or sometimes just viewed, redirect the user to a malicious site.

3. **Redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites**: This is a common method used by exploit kits like RIG to deliver exploits. The redirect often leads to a landing page that hosts the exploit kit.

4. **Running an obfuscated PowerShell script**: PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both benign and malicious purposes. Obfuscating a PowerShell script makes it harder for security software to detect its malicious intent. The script could be used to fetch additional malware or to execute commands on the compromised system.

5. **Using the Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This refers to the use of legitimate system tools (like PowerShell) to execute commands or scripts that aid in the attack. This technique is often used for execution and persistence.

Given these components, the question asks if it's likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script. Let's evaluate the plausibility:

- **Initial Access**: RIG EK typically gains initial access through exploits delivered via malvertising or compromised websites. This doesn't necessarily involve running a PowerShell script first.
- **Execution**: Running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware is a technique that could be used post-exploitation, after initial access has been gained. It's less common for the initial exploit delivery itself to depend on running such a script.

However, considering the evolving nature of threats and the creativity of attackers, it's not impossible for an attack chain to involve running a PowerShell script early in the process, especially if the goal is to evade detection or to use the system's own tools against it.

Given the information and focusing on the typical behavior of RIG EK and the use of PowerShell scripts in attacks:

- The primary method of RIG EK involves exploiting vulnerabilities through malvertising or compromised sites directly.
- The use of an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware could be part of the post-exploitation activities or even part of a more complex initial access strategy, but it's not the most common or primary method associated with RIG EK's operation.

Therefore, while it's possible for attackers to evolve their TTPs and incorporate PowerShell scripts in innovative ways, the described sequence doesn't align perfectly with the most common and well-documented behaviors of RIG EK.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify RIG EK's primary method of operation: Delivering exploits through malvertising or compromised websites.
2. Consider the role of obfuscated PowerShell scripts: Typically used post-exploitation or for specific evasion/persistence techniques.
3. Evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence: Less common but not impossible, given the adaptability of attackers.

**Final Answer: B**
