To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: 
   - The question mentions Mustang Panda, a known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group.
   - It references the use of a "double extension trick" (e.g., sample.doc.lnk) in a spearphishing campaign. This trick is used to disguise malicious files as harmless documents to evade defenses.
   - The question asks if Mustang Panda is likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy after employing such a tactic.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) mentioned is the use of spearphishing with a double extension trick to gain initial access.
   - The subsequent TTP in question is the potential use of a reverse SOCKS proxy module for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (T1566)**: The double extension trick is a social engineering tactic used for initial access, aiming to trick users into opening malicious files.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communications (T1567, T1572)**: After gaining access, establishing a reliable and covert C2 channel is crucial for APT groups. A reverse SOCKS proxy module can facilitate this by allowing the attackers to communicate with the compromised host from behind firewalls or NATs, masking their C2 traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Mustang Panda uses spearphishing with a double extension trick to gain initial access to a target system. This is a common initial access vector for many APT groups.
   - **Step 2**: After gaining access, the next logical step for any APT group, including Mustang Panda, would be to establish a command and control channel. This is necessary for executing further tactics, such as deploying additional malware, stealing data, or moving laterally within the network.
   - **Step 3**: Using a reverse SOCKS proxy module is a technique that aligns with the goal of establishing covert and flexible C2 communications. It allows the attackers to bypass typical network defenses and maintain access to the compromised system.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the context of the initial access tactic and the need for subsequent C2 communications, it is plausible that Mustang Panda would use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their strategy. This aligns with common practices among APT groups to maintain stealthy and reliable communication with compromised systems.

**Final Answer: A**
