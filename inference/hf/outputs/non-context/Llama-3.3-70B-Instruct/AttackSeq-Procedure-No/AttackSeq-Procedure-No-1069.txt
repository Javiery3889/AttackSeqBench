To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence based on known behaviors of Tropic Trooper and the general tactics used by threat actors.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
     2. Executing the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe.
     3. Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
   - The question asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe **only after** using Equation Editor exploits.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Tropic Trooper** is known for sophisticated and targeted attacks, often involving custom malware and exploits.
   - **Injecting a malicious DLL** into a legitimate process like dllhost.exe is a common technique to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **FakeRun loader** could be used to execute dllhost.exe in a way that disguises the execution of the malicious DLL.
   - **Equation Editor exploits** have been used by various threat actors to gain initial access or execute malicious code on a target system.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves exploiting a vulnerability (Equation Editor) to execute malicious code, which is a common initial access technique.
   - Injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe and using a loader like FakeRun to execute it represents a method for maintaining access and executing malicious code without being detected.
   - The question's phrasing ("only after") suggests a specific order of operations where the exploitation precedes the execution of the malicious DLL via the FakeRun loader.
   - Given the nature of Tropic Trooper's operations, which often involve sophisticated and multi-staged attacks, it's plausible that they would use an exploit to gain access or execute an initial payload, which then sets up further malicious activities, such as injecting a DLL into dllhost.exe and executing it via a custom loader.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and the known behaviors of Tropic Trooper, it's reasonable to consider that the group could execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe after using Equation Editor exploits as part of a multi-staged attack. This aligns with the use of initial exploits to establish a foothold, followed by more targeted and evasive maneuvers to achieve persistence and execute malicious payloads.

Final Answer: A
