To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Initial Access via Exploited Misconfigured Docker API Ports**: The initial access vector involves exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports that are exposed to the internet. This is a plausible initial access technique (TA0001) as identified in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary takes advantage of a vulnerability or misconfiguration to gain access to a network or system.

2. **Gathering Detailed Knowledge of an Organization's Supply Chain Relationships During Reconnaissance**: After gaining initial access, the next step mentioned is gathering detailed knowledge of the organization's supply chain relationships during the reconnaissance phase. Reconnaissance (TA0043) involves gathering information about the target environment and its defenses. Understanding an organization's supply chain can provide valuable insights into potential vulnerabilities, third-party dependencies, and avenues for further exploitation. This step aligns with the tactics of gathering information about the target's internal and external network, system, and organizational structure.

3. **Deploying Malicious Containers**: Finally, deploying malicious containers is mentioned as a subsequent action. This could involve techniques such as creating or modifying system images (T1543.001) or executing a container via a container management service (T1204.002), which are techniques used for persistence, privilege escalation, or execution.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**, it is likely that adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers. This sequence makes sense because understanding the supply chain can reveal vulnerabilities in third-party components or services that could be exploited to deploy malicious containers more effectively.

- **B: No**, it is not likely that adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers. This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described is unlikely, which contradicts the logical progression of reconnaissance informing subsequent exploitation tactics.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports for access is a known vulnerability.
2. Reconnaissance to understand the target environment, including supply chain relationships, is a common next step to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan further actions.
3. Deploying malicious containers could be a method to exploit vulnerabilities found during reconnaissance, including those related to supply chain weaknesses.

**Final Answer: A**
