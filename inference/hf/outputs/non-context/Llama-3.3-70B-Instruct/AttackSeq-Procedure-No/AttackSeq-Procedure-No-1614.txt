To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice based on the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts. This action involves interacting with a user's email client to gather information, which aligns with the technique of "Collecting email accounts" that could be categorized under the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The question then asks if the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. Exfiltration over FTP would fall under the "Exfiltration" tactic, specifically using "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" as a technique.

2. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Answer Choice A (Yes)**: This choice suggests an automated process where, immediately after collecting email accounts, they are exfiltrated over FTP. While it's technically possible for an attacker to automate such a process, the question doesn't provide explicit information about the automation of exfiltration or the use of FTP as the exfiltration method. However, in the context of a sophisticated attack, it's plausible that an attacker could set up an automated process for exfiltrating data once it's collected.
   - **Answer Choice B (No)**: This choice implies that the collection of email accounts and their exfiltration are separate steps, not necessarily automated or directly connected in the sequence described. This could be true if the attacker intends to use the collected email accounts for further actions like phishing, spear-phishing, or as part of a larger campaign that doesn't involve immediate exfiltration over FTP.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question outlines a specific TTP related to collecting email accounts, which is a common technique used in various cyber attacks for further exploitation.
   - The exfiltration of data, in this case, email accounts, over FTP to remote servers, is a plausible next step in an attack sequence aimed at stealing sensitive information.
   - However, the question does not explicitly state that the exfiltration happens automatically or that FTP is the chosen protocol for exfiltration. It merely asks if the collected accounts "will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP," which introduces an assumption about the automation and method of exfiltration.
   - Given the information provided and typical attack patterns, it's reasonable to consider that an attacker might use automated means to exfiltrate data once collected, but the specific use of FTP as an exfiltration method and the automation of this process are details that would typically be specified in a more detailed threat intelligence report.

**Final Answer: B**
