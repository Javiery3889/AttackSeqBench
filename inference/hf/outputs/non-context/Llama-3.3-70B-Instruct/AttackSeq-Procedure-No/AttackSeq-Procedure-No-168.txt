To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in determining the most plausible sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) based on the given scenario.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where SkinnyBoy, presumably a piece of malware, communicates with a Command and Control (C2) server located at updaterweb[.]com. This communication is part of the command and control process and involves an HTTP POST request. The question asks whether it is likely that SkinnyBoy would obfuscate its C2 traffic with an altered version of base64 before communicating with the C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned or implied in the question include:
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The process by which a malware communicates with its C2 server to receive commands or send stolen data.
   - **Obfuscation**: The technique of making something (in this case, C2 traffic) difficult to understand or interpret, often to evade detection.
   - **Use of HTTP POST Request**: A method used for communicating with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Obfuscation of C2 Traffic**: Malware often uses obfuscation techniques to hide its communication with C2 servers from security software and analysts. Base64 encoding is a common method for obfuscating data, including C2 traffic, because it can easily disguise the content of the communication, making it less suspicious at first glance.
   - **Altered Version of Base64**: Using an altered version of base64 (or any encoding scheme) for obfuscation adds an extra layer of complexity for defenders trying to decode and understand the communication. This is a plausible step for an attacker to take, as it increases the difficulty of detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the goal of the malware (SkinnyBoy) - to communicate with its C2 server without being detected.
   - **Step 2**: Consider common techniques used by malware to evade detection during C2 communication, such as obfuscation.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the likelihood of using an altered version of base64 for obfuscation, given its effectiveness in disguising communication content.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the common practices of malware to evade detection, it is reasonable to conclude that SkinnyBoy would likely attempt to obfuscate its C2 traffic. Using an altered version of base64 is a plausible method for achieving this obfuscation, as it complicates the detection and analysis of the communication.

**Final Answer: A**
