To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Analysis**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already exfiltrated data, indicating they have gained access to the system and have established a Command and Control (C&C) channel. This suggests the attackers are in the "Exfiltration" and possibly "Command and Control" phases of the attack lifecycle.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Exfiltration**: The attackers have already exfiltrated data, which aligns with TTPs like "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel" (T1041).
   - **Established C&C Channel**: This is a prerequisite for many subsequent actions, including exfiltration and receiving further commands.
   - **Collecting System Information**: After establishing a foothold, attackers often collect system information for further exploitation or to understand the environment better. This could involve techniques like "System Information Discovery" (T1082) and "Screen Capture" (T1113) for gathering screenshots.
   - **Communication with C&C Server**: Using an encrypted protocol to communicate with the C&C server is common, aligning with "Encrypted Channel" (T1573) to send and receive commands and data.

3. **Evaluation of the Scenario**:
   - The sequence described involves collecting detailed system information (file manipulation, screenshots, network details) after exfiltrating data. This is plausible as attackers often seek to maximize the value of their access.
   - The use of a backdoor for these activities is consistent with TTPs like "Application Window Discovery" (T1010) for file manipulation and "System Network Configuration Discovery" (T1016) for network details.
   - Communicating with the C&C server using an encrypted protocol to send a 'Start conversation' message and receive a 'Get Victim Information' message fits the pattern of command and control operations, where the attacker's server directs the malware or the attacker's actions on the compromised system.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the context and the TTPs involved, the scenario described is plausible. Attackers often seek to gather as much information as possible about a compromised system to plan further actions, and using encrypted communication for C&C activities is a common practice to evade detection.
