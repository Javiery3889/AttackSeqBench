To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on typical adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with the adversary, FamousSparrow, gaining initial access through the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in various software products (Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera). This is a plausible initial access technique (T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application) as it leverages known vulnerabilities to gain a foothold into the target environment.

2. **Execution and Persistence**: The use of cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor is a common technique for executing commands (T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter) and establishing persistence (T1505 - Server Software Component). Backdoors like SparrowDoor allow adversaries to maintain access to the compromised system, which aligns with typical post-exploitation activities.

3. **Resource Development**: Acquiring infrastructure from various companies (Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY) for resource development could be part of the adversary's effort to establish command and control (C2) infrastructure (T1094 - Custom Command and Control Protocol) or to expand their operational capacity. This step is also plausible as it supports the continuation of operations and potential future campaigns.

Given these considerations, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with common patterns observed in cyber attacks:

- **Initial Access** through vulnerability exploitation is a well-documented method.
- **Execution** of commands to install backdoors is a standard technique for maintaining access.
- **Resource Development** through acquiring infrastructure supports the establishment of C2 channels and future operations.

Therefore, the sequence described is consistent with known adversary behaviors and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
