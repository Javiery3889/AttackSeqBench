To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions Mustang Panda, a known Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, using documents to connect to Command and Control (C2) domains and IP addresses. It then asks if they are likely to use the double extension trick (e.g., sample.doc.lnk) to evade defenses in their spearphishing campaign.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied here involves:
   - Initial communication or infection via documents (possibly malicious documents or spearphishing attachments).
   - Attempting to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses for command and control.
   - Potential use of evasion techniques, such as the double extension trick, to bypass security measures.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Mustang Panda's Known TTPs**: Mustang Panda is known for its sophisticated spearphishing campaigns, often using malicious documents as initial infection vectors. They have been observed using various techniques to evade detection, including exploiting vulnerabilities in software and using clever social engineering tactics.
   - **Double Extension Trick**: This technique involves using a file with a double extension (e.g., sample.doc.lnk) to disguise the true nature of the file. The first extension (.doc) might suggest a harmless document, while the second extension (.lnk) indicates it's actually a link file that could execute malicious code. This can deceive users and potentially evade some security controls that do not thoroughly inspect file types.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Mustang Panda uses spearphishing with malicious documents, which aligns with their known TTPs.
   - **Step 2**: The use of C2 domains and IP addresses for communication is a common practice among APT groups for maintaining control over compromised systems.
   - **Step 3**: Given Mustang Panda's history of sophisticated social engineering and evasion techniques, using a double extension trick to further evade defenses would be consistent with their operational security mindset.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Considering Mustang Panda's known TTPs and the context provided, it is plausible that they would utilize techniques like the double extension trick to enhance the effectiveness of their spearphishing campaigns and evade detection.

**Final Answer: A**
