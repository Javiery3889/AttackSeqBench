To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where, after the Discovery phase (which involves collecting information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data), the malware is considering initiating a download via FTP as part of the Command and Control (C2) phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The first phase mentioned is the Discovery phase, which aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This phase involves gathering information about the target environment.
   - The second phase mentioned is the Command and Control phase, which aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This phase involves establishing a means for the adversary to issue commands to the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The Discovery phase is about gathering information, which is a precursor to deciding how to proceed with the attack.
   - The Command and Control phase involves communicating with the compromised system to issue commands, which could include downloading additional malware or tools.
   - Using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for downloading files as part of the C2 phase is plausible because it's a common protocol for transferring files over the internet. However, the context of using FTP specifically after the Discovery phase for downloading needs evaluation. Typically, after discovery, an attacker might use the information gathered to decide on the next steps, which could include establishing a C2 channel. The use of FTP for this purpose is technically feasible but might not be the most common or stealthy method compared to other C2 protocols or channels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The Discovery phase is correctly followed by the need for a C2 channel to be established for further malicious activities.
   - **Step 2**: The use of FTP for downloading files as part of the C2 phase is technically possible but might not be the preferred method due to its lack of stealthiness and the existence of more sophisticated C2 protocols.
   - **Step 3**: Considering the question asks if it is "likely" that the malware will initiate a download via FTP, we must weigh the technical feasibility against common practices. While FTP could be used, the likelihood compared to other methods (like HTTPS or more bespoke C2 protocols) might be lower due to detectability and the preference for more covert channels.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Given the technical feasibility but considering the context of common practices in malware operations, the answer leans towards it being possible but not the most likely method due to the existence of more covert and sophisticated C2 channels.

**Final Answer: B**
