To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the Darkhotel APT targeting chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access before employing advanced evasion techniques.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that involve:
   - Deploying malware components (downloaders, stealers, keyloggers).
   - Targeting chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access.
   - Using sophisticated evasion techniques (signing backdoors with digital certificates, encrypting gathered data).

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with the deployment of malware, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks for gaining initial access and establishing a foothold. The next step mentioned is targeting chat messages for credential access, which aligns with the goal of many attackers to gain deeper access and move laterally within a network. Finally, the use of sophisticated evasion techniques suggests an attempt to maintain access and avoid detection.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Deploying Malware**: This is a common initial step for many APT groups, including Darkhotel, to gain access to a target network.
   - **Targeting Chat Messages for Credential Access**: Given the increasing use of collaboration tools in businesses, targeting these platforms for credential theft is plausible. Attackers often seek to exploit the trust and openness of these platforms to gain access to sensitive information.
   - **Using Sophisticated Evasion Techniques**: The use of digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypting gathered data are advanced techniques used by sophisticated threat actors to evade detection and maintain access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial deployment of malware aligns with known TTPs of APT groups.
   - The targeting of chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access is a plausible next step, given the goal of gaining deeper network access.
   - The employment of sophisticated evasion techniques after gaining access and stealing credentials is consistent with the behavior of advanced threat actors seeking to maintain access and avoid detection.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the sequence of TTPs described and the known behaviors of sophisticated APT groups like Darkhotel, it is reasonable to conclude that targeting chat messages in collaboration tools for credential access before using advanced evasion techniques is a plausible sequence of actions.
