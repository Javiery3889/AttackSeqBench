To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary tactics and techniques.

1. **Initial Access (TA0001)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining an initial foothold within a network. Techniques under this tactic include Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190), which involves exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain access.

2. **Execution (TA0002)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. The use of cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor falls under this category, possibly utilizing techniques like Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) for executing system commands.

3. **Command and Control (TA0011)**: After gaining access and executing malware, adversaries establish a command and control channel to communicate with compromised systems. Using an encrypted HTTPS channel for this purpose is a common technique (T1071: Application Layer Protocol) to hide the communication.

Given the sequence of events:
- **SparrowDoor** is executed using cmd.exe, indicating that the adversary has already gained access to the system.
- Communication with a C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel suggests that the adversary is in the Command and Control phase.

The question asks if it's likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access. 

Given that SparrowDoor's execution and the establishment of a C&C channel are mentioned, and considering the typical attack flow (Initial Access -> Execution -> Command and Control), it's reasonable to infer that some form of initial access technique was used to introduce SparrowDoor into the environment. Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications is a plausible method for achieving initial access, as it aligns with known tactics and techniques used by adversaries.

Therefore, considering the provided sequence of events and the typical attack flow, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: A
