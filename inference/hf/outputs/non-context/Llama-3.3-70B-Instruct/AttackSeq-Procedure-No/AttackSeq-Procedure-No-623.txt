To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The question starts with the employment of PowerShell injection techniques via the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module. This module is used for executing DLLs in memory, which is a technique often used by attackers to evade detection and execute malicious code directly in memory without writing it to disk. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "PowerShell" (T1086) and "Dynamic Data Exchange" or similar techniques for in-memory execution.

2. **Network Service Scanning**: The question then mentions the potential use of tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning. These tools are commonly used for discovering open ports and services on a network, which can help attackers identify potential vulnerabilities to exploit. This activity aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Network Service Scanning" (T1046) technique.

3. **Use of SombRAT Backdoor**: Finally, the question mentions the use of the SombRAT backdoor for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery. SombRAT is a remote access trojan that can be used for various malicious activities, including gathering system information and controlling the compromised system. The mentioned activities align with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Process Discovery" (T1005), "System Information Discovery" (T1082), and potentially "System Time Discovery" could be related to techniques involving timing or scheduling (though specific techniques might vary).

Given the sequence of TTPs described:
- The initial use of PowerShell injection for execution is a common method for gaining initial access and executing malicious code.
- The subsequent use of network scanning tools like pscan and nmap for identifying potential targets or vulnerabilities within the network is a logical next step after gaining access, as it helps in expanding the attacker's foothold.
- The use of a backdoor like SombRAT for discovery activities is also plausible, as backdoors are often used for maintaining access and gathering more information about the compromised system and network.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of an attack from initial access, to network reconnaissance, and then to the use of a backdoor for further system discovery, the sequence described in the question seems plausible.
