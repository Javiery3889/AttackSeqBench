To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Distribution of malicious LNK files**: This is a common initial access technique (TA0001) used by various threat actors, including APT groups. Disguising malicious files as seemingly innocuous documents like a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results is a social engineering tactic to trick victims into opening these files.

2. **Executing a JavaScript file**: The execution of a JavaScript file to perform specific actions indicates the use of a script (T1204) to achieve initial access or to establish persistence. The actions described, such as creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL, suggest techniques related to execution (TA0002), persistence (TA0003), and command and control (TA0011).

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The question implies a sequence where the distribution of malicious LNK files via spear-phishing occurs after the execution of a JavaScript file. However, typically, the initial access vector (such as spear-phishing with malicious attachments or links) precedes the execution of malicious scripts or files. The actions described (executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe', sending a POST request) seem to be post-exploitation activities rather than pre-phishing activities.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of events would involve the initial distribution of malicious LNK files (or other initial access vectors) followed by the execution of malicious scripts or files. The described actions (executing specific executables, copying files to the startup directory, and communicating with a command and control server) are more likely to occur after the initial compromise, not before the phishing attempt.

Therefore, the scenario as described, where the Higaisa APT group distributes malicious LNK files via spear-phishing only after executing a JavaScript file to perform the mentioned actions, seems unlikely. The typical sequence involves initial access (which could be via spear-phishing with malicious attachments), followed by the execution of malicious code, and then further exploitation and persistence activities.

Final Answer: B
