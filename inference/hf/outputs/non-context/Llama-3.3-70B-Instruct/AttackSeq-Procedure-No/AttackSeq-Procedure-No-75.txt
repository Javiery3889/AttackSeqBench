To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) typically observed in cyber attacks, especially in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware has already collected specific types of data (keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents) from an infected computer. The next step in question is whether the malware would then gather more general information about the infected computer (system and user names) to transmit this data to attackers via encrypted emails.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described involves:
   - **Collection**: Gathering keystrokes, directory listings, and specific document types (HWP documents), which aligns with the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Techniques under this tactic include collecting input (e.g., keystrokes), screen captures, and file contents.
   - **Transmission**: The question then posits the malware gathering system and user information for transmission. This could be seen as part of the "Exfiltration" tactic, where data is transmitted out of the network, often using encrypted channels to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests that after collecting specific data, the malware would then gather more general system information for transmission. This sequence is plausible because attackers often seek to understand the environment they are operating in (including system and user names) to better navigate, evade detection, and exfiltrate data effectively. The use of encrypted emails for data transmission is a common technique to avoid detection.
   - **Option B (No)**: This option implies that gathering system and user names after collecting specific data types is unlikely. However, understanding the system and user context can be crucial for attackers to assess the value of the data they've collected and to plan further actions, making this option less likely to be correct in the context of a sophisticated attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial collection of keystrokes, directory listings, and specific documents indicates a targeted interest in the victim's activities and data.
   - Gathering system and user information would logically follow as a means to contextualize the collected data and potentially identify avenues for further exploitation or to tailor the exfiltration method.
   - The use of encrypted emails for transmission suggests an attempt to maintain stealth, which is consistent with the tactics of sophisticated threat actors.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the logical progression of a cyber attack and the typical goals of threat actors to gather context and maintain stealth, the most plausible sequence involves the malware gathering more information about the infected computer after initial data collection for effective exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
