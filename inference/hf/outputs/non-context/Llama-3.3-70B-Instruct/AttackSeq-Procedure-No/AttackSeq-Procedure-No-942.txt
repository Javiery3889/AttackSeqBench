To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) typically associated with malware operations, particularly focusing on the Discovery and Exfiltration phases as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes SLUB malware engaging in activities under the Discovery phase, which includes collecting system information and capturing screenshots. These actions are typical of the Discovery tactic (TA0007 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework), where an adversary seeks to gather information about the system, network, or environment they are operating in. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to a Command and Control (C2) server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery Phase**: This phase involves gathering information about the target environment. The actions described (collecting system information and capturing screenshots) fit within this phase.
   - **Exfiltration Phase**: This involves transferring data from the target system to an adversary-controlled system. Exfiltration (TA0010 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework) is a logical next step after Discovery, especially if the adversary has collected data they wish to analyze further or use for future operations.

Given the context, the question essentially asks whether the malware's natural progression after collecting data would be to exfiltrate it. 

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the primary goal of the Discovery phase, which is to gather information.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the collected data (system information and screenshots) would likely be of value to the adversary for planning future actions or analyzing the target's environment.
   - **Step 3**: Consider the typical behavior of malware like SLUB, which often includes communicating with a C2 server for various purposes, including receiving commands and exfiltrating data.
   - **Step 4**: Evaluate the likelihood of automatic exfiltration based on common malware behaviors and the MITRE ATT&CK framework's description of Exfiltration tactics.

**Conclusion**: Given the typical lifecycle of malware operations and the specific actions described, it is reasonable to expect that after collecting valuable data, the next logical step for the malware would be to exfiltrate this data to its C2 server for further analysis or storage. This aligns with the common goals of malware to gather, transmit, and utilize collected data for malicious purposes.

**Final Answer: A**
