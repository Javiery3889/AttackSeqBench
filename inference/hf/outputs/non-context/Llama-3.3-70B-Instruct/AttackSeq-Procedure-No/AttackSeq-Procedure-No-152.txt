To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: 
   - The question mentions TG1021, which refers to a threat group.
   - It talks about the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit. SharpHound is a tool used for gathering information about the Active Directory environment, which aligns with the Discovery phase. PowerSploit is a framework that includes various scripts for different purposes, including exploiting vulnerabilities, which can be used in various phases of an attack.
   - The question specifies that these tools were used during the Discovery phase to gather output files, indicating reconnaissance activities aimed at understanding the target environment.
   - The question then asks about the likelihood of TG1021 abusing a compromised AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) server's SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) token during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery Phase Activities**: The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance suggests that TG1021 is highly capable and interested in deeply understanding the target's network and systems. This level of reconnaissance often precedes more sophisticated attacks.
   - **Lateral Movement Phase**: This phase involves moving through a network to expand access and control. Abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token would allow for the creation of forged authentication tokens, enabling the threat actor to move laterally within the network without being detected, as SAML tokens are used for single sign-on (SSO) purposes.
   - **Abusing SAML Tokens**: Given the sophisticated nature of the tools used in the Discovery phase, it's reasonable to assume that TG1021 has the capability and intent to exploit high-impact vulnerabilities or configurations, such as those related to AD FS and SAML tokens, to facilitate lateral movement.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the capabilities demonstrated by TG1021 in the Discovery phase. They have shown the ability to use advanced tools for reconnaissance.
   - **Step 2**: Consider the goals of the Lateral Movement phase. Threat actors aim to expand their access and control within a network.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the potential for abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token. This action aligns with the goals of lateral movement and is consistent with the level of sophistication demonstrated by TG1021.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the sophisticated tools used by TG1021 and the goals of the Lateral Movement phase, it is plausible that they would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to facilitate undetected movement within the network.

**Final Answer: A**
