To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of API hooking being used in the context provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving Waterbear's backdoor, which includes specific configurations for encryption/decryption and communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server. The focus is on whether API hooking techniques, specifically modifying functions like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory, would be used to evade detection.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned or implied include:
   - **Encryption/Decryption**: Using an encryption/decryption key for secure communication.
   - **XOR-encrypted C&C Server Address**: Encrypting the C&C server address using XOR encryption.
   - **API Hooking**: Modifying system calls or functions (like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable') to intercept, modify, or redirect the operation of these functions.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Purpose of API Hooking**: API hooking is a technique used by malware to intercept and alter the behavior of system calls. This can be used for various purposes, including evading detection by hiding the malware's activities from security software.
   - **Relevance to Waterbear's Backdoor**: Given that Waterbear's backdoor is designed with stealth in mind (using encryption for its communications), it is plausible that its developers would also employ API hooking to prevent detection by security tools. Modifying functions like 'ZwOpenProcess' (used to access another process) and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' (used to retrieve information about TCP connections) could help the backdoor hide its network activities or access to other processes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Waterbear's backdoor uses encryption and XOR-encrypted C&C server addresses, indicating a focus on stealth and evasion.
   - **Step 2**: API hooking is a technique that aligns with these goals by allowing the malware to hide its activities from security software.
   - **Step 3**: Modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' specifically could help in evading detection by either hiding the backdoor's interactions with other processes or masking its network communications.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Given the stealthy nature of Waterbear's backdoor and the purpose of API hooking, it is reasonable to conclude that API hooking techniques, such as modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable', could indeed be used to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A**
