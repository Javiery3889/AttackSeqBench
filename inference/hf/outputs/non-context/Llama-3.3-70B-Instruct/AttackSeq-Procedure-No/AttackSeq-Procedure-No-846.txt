To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence as presented:

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with delivering KerrDown to targets. This implies an initial access vector, likely through phishing or some form of social engineering, where the victim is tricked into opening malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros or executing RAR archives. These archives enable DLL side-loading, a technique used to load malicious DLLs into legitimate processes.

2. **Execution**: The malicious document or archive executes code on the victim's system. This could involve creating system services or using existing processes to execute the malicious payload.

3. **Persistence**: Creating system services is a method used by attackers to maintain persistence on a compromised system. This allows the malware to survive system reboots and continue executing without the need for the initial exploit to be re-run.

4. **Execution of Cryptocurrency Mining Software**: The execution of cryptocurrency mining software is a common goal for many types of malware, as it provides a direct financial benefit to the attackers. This software can be executed through various means, including the creation of system services.

5. **Use of Base64 Blobs**: The use of base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture suggests an attempt to evade detection and ensure compatibility across different systems. Base64 encoding can be used to obfuscate malware, making it harder for security software to detect.

Given this sequence:
- The initial delivery and execution of malware through Office documents or RAR archives are plausible initial steps.
- Creating system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software is a logical step for persistence and to achieve the attacker's goal of financial gain.
- Using base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture is a technique that could be used at various stages of the attack to ensure the malware runs correctly and evades detection.

Therefore, considering the described sequence of TTPs, it is plausible that after delivering the malware, the Office document could create system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.
