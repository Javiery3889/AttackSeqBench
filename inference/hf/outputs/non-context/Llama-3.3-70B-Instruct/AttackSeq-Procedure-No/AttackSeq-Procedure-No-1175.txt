To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing**: The attack starts with spear-phishing emails, which is a common technique under the Reconnaissance tactic. This method is used to trick specific individuals into revealing sensitive information or, more commonly, to gain initial access to a system by enticing the recipient to open a malicious attachment or click on a link.

2. **Execution of Taidoor Malware**: After the initial access, the Taidoor malware is mentioned. Taidoor is known as a remote access tool (RAT) that can be used for various malicious purposes, including espionage. It's plausible that after gaining initial access, the adversary would use a malware like Taidoor to establish a foothold within the target's system.

3. **Beaconing Communications**: The question mentions the malware executing beaconing communications using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern. Beaconing is a technique where malware periodically sends signals (or "beacons") to its command and control (C2) server, indicating that the malware is active and ready for further instructions. This is a common behavior for many types of malware, including RATs like Taidoor, as it allows the attackers to maintain a stealthy presence and await further instructions without being immediately detected.

4. **Exploiting a Vulnerability in Microsoft Office**: Finally, the question mentions exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to drop the malware onto the target's system. This is a plausible step, as exploiting vulnerabilities in commonly used software like Microsoft Office is a well-documented tactic used by adversaries to gain initial access or execute malware on a target system.

Given these steps, the sequence described aligns with known TTPs used by adversaries:
- **Initial Access** through spear-phishing.
- **Execution** of malware (Taidoor) for establishing a foothold.
- **Command and Control** through beaconing communications.
- **Exploitation** of a vulnerability for malware deployment.

Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques mentioned, it is indeed likely that the Taidoor malware would execute beaconing communications as part of its operation after being dropped onto a system, potentially through the exploitation of a Microsoft Office vulnerability.
