To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Persistence**: The attackers have already established persistence by configuring applications to run batch files every hour. This suggests they have a foothold in the system and are looking to maintain access over time. This action aligns with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves techniques that allow an adversary to maintain their presence on a system.

2. **ARP Cache Poisoning for Credential Collection**: The next step mentioned is the use of ARP cache poisoning to collect credentials. ARP cache poisoning is a technique used to manipulate the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache, allowing an attacker to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network. This can be used to intercept traffic, potentially allowing the collection of credentials if the intercepted traffic includes authentication data. This technique falls under the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Uploading Credentials to an External FTP Server**: Finally, the attackers plan to upload the collected credentials to an external FTP server they control. This action is associated with the "Exfiltration" tactic, which involves techniques used to transfer data from a compromised system to an adversary-controlled system.

Given this sequence of TTPs:
- The attackers have already gained persistence, indicating they have some level of access to the system.
- They are looking to escalate their access or gather more sensitive information (credentials) through ARP cache poisoning, which is a plausible next step for an attacker seeking to expand their capabilities within a compromised network.
- The uploading of credentials to an external server is a logical step for exfiltrating sensitive data, which could be used for further malicious activities, such as selling the credentials, using them for lateral movement, or exploiting them in phishing attacks.

Considering these points, the sequence of TTPs described forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence. The use of ARP cache poisoning to collect credentials, followed by the exfiltration of those credentials, aligns with common tactics used by attackers to compromise and exploit networked systems.
