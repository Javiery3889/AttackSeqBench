To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the malware's next actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in similar attacks.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by a banking Trojan. Initially, the malware:
   - Searches for folders related to antivirus and banking software.
   - Collects system information.

These actions suggest the malware is gathering intelligence on the system's security posture and potential targets (banking software) for its next steps.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**: The question then asks whether, after these initial steps, it is likely that the malware will:
   - Collect files from network shared drives
   - Instead of capturing screenshots and mouse clicks while the user browses banking sites.

Let's evaluate these options in the context of common TTPs associated with banking Trojans:
   - **Collecting files from network shared drives**: This action could be part of the malware's effort to gather sensitive information. However, banking Trojans are typically more focused on real-time interaction with the user, especially when the user is accessing banking services.
   - **Capturing screenshots and mouse clicks while the user browses banking sites**: This is a very common TTP for banking Trojans. By capturing screenshots and logging keystrokes or mouse clicks, the malware can steal login credentials, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information directly related to banking activities.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial actions (searching for antivirus and banking software folders, collecting system information) suggest the malware is preparing for targeted actions against banking activities.
   - Banking Trojans are known for their ability to capture and manipulate user interactions with banking websites to steal financial information.
   - Collecting files from network shared drives might be a secondary or less common action compared to directly intercepting user input during banking sessions.

Given these considerations, the most plausible next step for a banking Trojan, after identifying potential targets and gathering system information, would be to focus on capturing sensitive information directly related to banking activities, such as login credentials or financial transactions.

**Final Answer: B**
