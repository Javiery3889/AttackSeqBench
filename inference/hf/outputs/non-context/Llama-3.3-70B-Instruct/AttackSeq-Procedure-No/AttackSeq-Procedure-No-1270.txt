To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario.

1. **Initial Compromise**: The attackers use the SocGholish framework disguised as a browser update. SocGholish is known for its ability to deliver malware by exploiting trust in software updates, which aligns with the technique of "Trick" or "Social Engineering" to gain initial access (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment, or T1566 - Phishing, in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

2. **Abusing AWS Systems Manager Inventory**: After the initial compromise, the attackers are said to abuse AWS Systems Manager Inventory. This action would fall under the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the technique of "System Information Discovery" (T1082). AWS Systems Manager Inventory can provide detailed information about the inventory of managed instances, which could be used to identify potential targets within the compromised network.

3. **Executing Cobalt Strike Beacon Payload**: The use of a .NET injector to execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload is a method of establishing command and control (C2) over the compromised system. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that can be used by attackers to establish a beacon, which allows for persistent access to the compromised system (T1090 - Proxy, or T1219 - Remote Access Tools, in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

Given this sequence of events:
- The initial compromise via SocGholish framework is plausible as it leverages social engineering tactics.
- The abuse of AWS Systems Manager Inventory for target identification within the network is also plausible, as it aligns with the attackers' need to understand the network layout and potential targets after initial access.
- The execution of a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload using a .NET injector for establishing command and control is a common tactic used by sophisticated attackers.

Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence. Each step logically follows from the previous one in terms of establishing access, gathering information, and then using that information to further compromise the network.
