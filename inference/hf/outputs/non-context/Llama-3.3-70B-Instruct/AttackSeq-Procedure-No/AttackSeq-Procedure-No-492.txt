To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involved.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence where a custom screenshot tool (used for collecting screenshots) is followed by the potential use of a custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon) and Cobalt Strike Beacon for Command and Control (C2) communication. The question specifically asks if it's likely that these tools will use the FTP protocol for C2 communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Initial Access and Collection**: The use of a custom screenshot tool for capturing and archiving screenshots suggests an initial access phase where the adversary is gathering information.
   - **Persistence and C2 Communication**: The mention of a custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon) and Cobalt Strike Beacon indicates the adversary's intent to maintain persistence within the compromised network and establish a means for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Custom Backdoor and Cobalt Strike Beacon Capabilities**: Both Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon are sophisticated tools capable of various C2 communication methods. Cobalt Strike, in particular, is known for its flexibility in communication protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS, among others.
   - **FTP Protocol for C2 Communication**: While FTP can be used for C2 communication, it's less common due to its lack of encryption (unless FTPS is used) and the fact that it's more easily detectable compared to other protocols like HTTPS, which blends in with normal web traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The use of a custom screenshot tool indicates the adversary is already in the network and looking to gather more information, suggesting they have achieved initial access.
   - **Step 2**: The deployment of a custom backdoor and Cobalt Strike Beacon for persistence and C2 communication implies the adversary is looking for reliable and stealthy communication channels.
   - **Step 3**: Considering the capabilities of Cobalt Strike and the general preference for stealthy C2 communication, using a protocol like FTP, which is less common and potentially more detectable, seems less likely unless specifically required by the operational environment or to blend in with existing FTP traffic.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the sophistication of the tools mentioned (Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon) and the general preference for stealthier communication protocols, it seems less likely that the FTP protocol would be the primary choice for C2 communication unless there's a specific reason to use it (e.g., to blend in with existing traffic or due to network constraints).

**Final Answer: B**
