To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario.

1. **Reconnaissance Activities**: The initial step involves gathering information about the target system. This can include both passive (e.g., gathering publicly available information) and active (e.g., network scanning) methods. This phase is typical in the early stages of an attack, as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under "Reconnaissance" (TA0043).

2. **Malicious Implants like BlackEnergy 3**: BlackEnergy is known as a sophisticated malware framework used in several high-profile attacks. It's capable of various malicious activities, including data exfiltration, denial-of-service attacks, and the deployment of additional malware. The mention of BlackEnergy 3 suggests a sophisticated attack toolset.

3. **Use of Ruby Scripts to Execute Payloads**: The use of scripting languages like Ruby for executing payloads is plausible. Attackers often use scripting languages for their flexibility and ease of execution on compromised systems. Ruby, in particular, can be used for various tasks, including interacting with the operating system and executing system commands.

4. **Installation through Employee-Enabled Macro Execution**: This refers to a common attack vector where malicious macros in documents (often Microsoft Office files) are executed by employees, inadvertently installing malware on their systems. This technique aligns with "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1193) and "Trick" (T1566.001) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an attacker tricks a user into opening a malicious file or clicking on a link.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**, it is plausible. The sequence described starts with reconnaissance, followed by the deployment of sophisticated malware (BlackEnergy 3) through a common attack vector (employee-enabled macro execution), and then using Ruby scripts for further malicious activities. This aligns with known TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors.

- **B: No**, this choice suggests the scenario is unlikely. However, based on the analysis, each step of the described sequence is a known and plausible tactic used by attackers.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Reconnaissance is a common initial step in cyber attacks.
2. The use of sophisticated malware like BlackEnergy 3 is consistent with targeted attacks.
3. Ruby scripts can be used for executing payloads, which is a flexible method for attackers.
4. Employee-enabled macro execution is a well-documented method for initial access.

**Final Answer: A**
