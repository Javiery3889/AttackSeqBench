To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of Gamaredon's actions based on typical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with this group.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions where an attacker, identified as Gamaredon, uses backdoors to list interesting files (such as Office documents) on a compromised system. Following this, the question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon would then collect files from various information repositories and automatically upload the harvested documents to a Command and Control (C&C) server.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves:
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied through the use of backdoors.
   - **Discovery**: Listing interesting files, which aligns with techniques like "File and Directory Discovery" (T1083) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Collection**: Collecting files from various information repositories, which could align with "Data from Information Repositories" (T1213) or similar collection techniques.
   - **Exfiltration**: Automatically uploading harvested documents to a C&C server, which aligns with "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel" (T1041).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Gamaredon Group's TTPs**: Gamaredon is known for its espionage-focused operations, often targeting Ukrainian entities. Their TTPs include using backdoors for initial access, discovering and collecting sensitive information, and exfiltrating data to their C&C servers.
   - **Likelihood of Collecting and Uploading Files**: Given Gamaredon's objectives, which typically involve gathering intelligence, it is plausible that after identifying interesting files, they would collect these files and upload them to their C&C server for further analysis. This action aligns with their known TTPs and objectives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Gamaredon uses backdoors to gain access and list interesting files, indicating an interest in the system's data.
   - **Step 2**: The group's known objectives and TTPs suggest they would collect sensitive information.
   - **Step 3**: Automatically uploading harvested documents to a C&C server is a common method for exfiltrating data, fitting Gamaredon's modus operandi.

**Final Answer: A**
