To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in determining the likelihood of BlueBravo establishing persistence through creating registry run keys after gathering victim system information.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question implies that BlueBravo has already completed the initial stages of an attack, which include reconnaissance. Gathering system information such as usernames, computer names, Windows versions, and lists of running processes is a common tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP) used by attackers to understand the target environment better. This information can help in planning subsequent attack phases.

2. **Identifying the TTPs**: The TTP mentioned here involves gathering system information, which aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Specifically, techniques like T1018 (Remote System Discovery), T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery), and T1057 (Process Discovery) might be relevant.

3. **Establishing Persistence**: The question asks about establishing persistence, which is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Creating registry run keys (T1060 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) is a technique used to achieve persistence. This method allows malware to execute automatically during system startup, maintaining access to the system.

4. **Evaluating the Sequence**: Given that BlueBravo has already gathered necessary system information, the next logical step in a typical attack sequence could involve establishing a persistent presence on the compromised system. Creating registry run keys is a common method for achieving this persistence because it ensures that the malware can survive system reboots and maintain access.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided sequence of events and the typical behavior of attackers aiming to maintain access to compromised systems, it is reasonable to conclude that after gathering system information, BlueBravo would likely attempt to establish persistence. Creating registry run keys is a well-documented technique for achieving this goal.
