To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Software Packing to Obfuscate the Payload**: This is a defense evasion technique where the attacker packs the malware in a way that makes it difficult for security software to detect. This technique is often used to evade signature-based detection.

2. **Deleting the Original File Post-Infection for Defense Evasion**: After the malware has been executed and the payload has been delivered, deleting the original file is another defense evasion technique. It aims to remove evidence of the initial infection vector, making it harder for investigators to trace back the attack.

3. **Sniffing Network Traffic to Collect Credentials**: This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to steal sensitive information such as login credentials. It is a common tactic used for credential access.

4. **Dropping a PE (Portable Executable) File**: Dropping a PE file could be part of the malware's payload delivery or a subsequent stage of the attack, where additional malicious tools or executables are introduced to the compromised system.

Given the sequence of TTPs described:
- The malware starts by evading defenses through obfuscation and then removes traces of its initial presence.
- The next logical step in a typical attack sequence after establishing a foothold and evading defenses would be to gather more information about the network or to escalate privileges. Sniffing network traffic for credentials aligns with these goals as it can provide the attacker with the means to move laterally within the network or gain elevated access.

Therefore, considering the typical progression of an attack and the goals of the TTPs mentioned, it is plausible that after evading defenses, the malware would attempt to gather more information or resources, such as credentials, before potentially dropping additional malicious files to further the attack.
