To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence in relation to the behavior of FIN4, a known threat actor group.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     1. Transmittal of stolen credentials to Command and Control (C2) servers for credential access.
     2. Use of spearphishing emails with embedded VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros.
     3. Prompting victims for Outlook credentials.
     4. Labeling the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' during resource development.
   - FIN4 is known for its sophisticated attacks, often targeting financial and pharmaceutical companies.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FIN4's Modus Operandi (MO):** FIN4 is recognized for its use of spearphishing as an initial infection vector, often employing VBA macros in Office documents to gain initial access. This aligns with the second TTP mentioned.
   - **Credential Access and Transmission:** The transmission of stolen credentials to C2 servers is a common practice among threat actors for credential access, which aligns with the first TTP.
   - **Specificity of Targeting Outlook Credentials:** FIN4's focus on financial information could extend to targeting email services like Outlook for business email compromise (BEC) or to gain further access to sensitive information, making the third TTP plausible.
   - **Use of Campaign Codes:** The use of unique identifiers or 'campaign codes' for tracking the origin of stolen credentials could be part of a sophisticated group's operational security and resource development, making the fourth TTP plausible as well.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** FIN4 uses spearphishing with VBA macros as an initial infection vector, which is consistent with the second TTP.
   - **Step 2:** The transmission of stolen credentials to C2 servers for credential access is a common practice, supporting the first TTP.
   - **Step 3:** Targeting Outlook credentials could be within FIN4's interests for further exploitation, supporting the third TTP.
   - **Step 4:** The use of campaign codes for tracking stolen credentials aligns with the operational sophistication attributed to FIN4, supporting the fourth TTP.

Given the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the known behaviors and capabilities of FIN4. Therefore, it is plausible that FIN4 would engage in such activities as part of their operations.

**Final Answer: A**
