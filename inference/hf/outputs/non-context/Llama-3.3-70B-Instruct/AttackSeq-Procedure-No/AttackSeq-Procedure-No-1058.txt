To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The question starts with the execution of an obfuscated batch script. This script is used to execute a PowerShell script named `myScript.ps1`. The use of an obfuscated script suggests an attempt to evade detection, which is a common technique used by attackers to hide their malicious activities.

2. **Execution and Persistence**: The execution of `myScript.ps1` via a batch script indicates that the attacker is leveraging PowerShell for its powerful capabilities in executing system commands and interacting with the .NET framework. This is a common technique (T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation, and T1086: PowerShell) used for executing commands and scripts on a compromised system.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: The question then inquires about the likelihood of the final PowerShell script leading to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT. njRAT is a known remote access trojan that allows attackers to control compromised systems remotely. Telnet, on the other hand, is a protocol used for remote access but is less commonly used for C2 in modern attacks due to its lack of encryption and security features.

Given the context:
- The use of obfuscated scripts and PowerShell suggests a sophisticated attack aiming to evade detection.
- njRAT is a specific malware tool used for C2, which implies a dedicated effort to establish a covert C2 channel.
- Telnet, being an insecure protocol, is less likely to be used for C2 in sophisticated attacks, especially when more secure and stealthy options like njRAT are available.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Obfuscation and Script Execution**: The attacker uses an obfuscated batch script to execute a PowerShell script, indicating a desire to remain stealthy.
2. **PowerShell Execution**: The use of PowerShell for script execution is common in attacks for its versatility and power.
3. **C2 Communication**: The question of whether Telnet would be used instead of njRAT for C2. Given the context of a sophisticated attack (obfuscation, use of PowerShell), it's less likely that an insecure protocol like Telnet would be used for C2 when a more capable and secure option like njRAT is mentioned.

**Conclusion**: Considering the sophistication implied by the use of obfuscated scripts and PowerShell, and given that njRAT is a tool specifically designed for secure and covert C2, it is less likely that the final PowerShell script would lead to using Telnet for C2 instead of njRAT.

**Final Answer: B**
