To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving a piece of malware, PyFlash, which communicates with its command and control (C&C) server and uses encryption (AES-128 in CBC mode) on specific ports for command and control operations. The question then asks if it's likely that PyFlash would gather system information (such as systeminfo, tasklist, and arp) through the backdoor as part of the discovery phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve:
   - Communication with a C&C server.
   - Use of encryption for command and control.
   - Potential gathering of system information (systeminfo, tasklist, arp) as part of the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - The initial actions (communicating with a C&C server and using encryption) are typical of malware establishing a foothold and preparing for further operations.
   - Gathering system information is a common next step in the attack sequence, aligning with the discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This phase involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, and its defenses to plan further actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: PyFlash establishes communication with its C&C server, indicating an active infection and the potential for further malicious activity.
   - **Step 2**: The use of encryption (AES-128 in CBC mode) on specific ports suggests an attempt to hide or protect the command and control traffic, which is a common tactic to evade detection.
   - **Step 3**: Given that the malware has established a secure channel for command and control, the next logical step would be to gather information about the compromised system to understand its environment, potential vulnerabilities, and how to proceed with the attack. This aligns with the discovery phase, where an adversary would use techniques like gathering system information (e.g., systeminfo, tasklist, arp) to inform their next actions.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical behavior of malware and the sequence of TTPs described, it is logical that after establishing a secure command and control channel, PyFlash would proceed to gather system information as part of its discovery phase to plan further malicious activities.
