To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like Tortoiseshell.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that Tortoiseshell gains initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app. This is a common TTP, often involving social engineering tactics to deceive victims into installing malicious software.

2. **Installation and Execution of 'IvizTech'**: After gaining initial access, the installation of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) like 'IvizTech' as a service would be a logical next step for maintaining persistence. This allows the attackers to have ongoing access to the compromised system, enabling them to execute further malicious activities.

3. **Maintaining Persistence**: Installing a RAT as a service is a recognized method for maintaining persistence (as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the technique "Create or Modify System Process" and "Service Registration"). This technique ensures that the malware survives system restarts and remains available for the attackers to use.

4. **Execution of Binaries by Malware Downloader**: After establishing persistence, the next step could involve downloading additional malicious binaries to expand the attackers' capabilities on the compromised system. This could include tools for lateral movement, data exfiltration, or further exploitation.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns with common attack patterns:
- **Initial Access** through social engineering,
- **Persistence** through the installation of a RAT like 'IvizTech',
- Followed by the **Execution of Malicious Binaries** to achieve additional objectives.

Therefore, it is plausible that after gaining initial access, the attackers would install and execute 'IvizTech' as a service to maintain persistence before executing further malicious activities, such as downloading and executing additional binaries.
