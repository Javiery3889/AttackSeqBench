To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence in relation to the behavior of the VERMIN malware.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions the use of an SFX (Self-Extracting Archive) executable themed around the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to perform initial access. This suggests a social engineering tactic, possibly phishing, where the theme is used to trick the target into opening the executable, thereby gaining initial access to the system.

2. **Execution**: After initial access, the execution of a decoy document is mentioned. This is a common technique used by malware to distract from the actual malicious activity or to make the malware seem like a legitimate application. The execution of a decoy document can serve to maintain access and potentially evade detection by making the malware's presence seem benign.

3. **Discovery**: The collection of the OS name via a WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) query is a discovery technique. Malware often uses WMI to gather information about the system it has compromised, which can be used for various purposes, including deciding which payloads to deploy or how to maintain persistence.

4. **Resource Deployment**: The decryption of an embedded resource using a brute force method to establish execution behavior is an unusual step. Typically, malware decrypts embedded resources using keys or algorithms that are either hardcoded or communicated from a command and control (C2) server. The use of a brute force method suggests an attempt to either obscure the decryption process or to use a method that doesn't rely on external communication, which could be detected.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility:

- The initial access via a themed SFX executable is plausible as a social engineering tactic.
- The execution of a decoy document to distract or seem legitimate is also a common tactic.
- The use of WMI for discovery aligns with typical malware behavior for gathering system information.
- The decryption of an embedded resource, while critical for execution, using a brute force method is less common but could be a technique used to avoid detection or to ensure the malware can operate without clear external command and control.

Considering the sequence and the tactics involved, the question essentially asks if the VERMIN malware, after performing initial access and some level of system discovery, would then proceed to decrypt an embedded resource in a brute force manner as part of establishing its execution behavior. Given the context provided, this sequence, although somewhat unusual in the specifics of the brute force decryption method, does follow a logical progression of initial access, maintaining access, discovery, and then resource deployment for further malicious activity.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the logical sequence of malware operations, the answer to whether VERMIN malware is likely to follow this sequence of actions is affirmative.
