To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence.

1. **Initial Actions**: The threat actors start by using Mimikatz to dump credentials. Mimikatz is a tool known for its ability to extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN codes, and kerberos tickets from memory. This action aligns with the technique of Credential Dumping (T1003) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Pass-the-Hash Attacks**: They then use Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks. Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols, which can be used for pass-the-hash attacks, allowing attackers to authenticate to a remote server or service without knowing the password, just the hash. This aligns with the technique of Use of Alternate Authentication Material (T1550) and specifically, Pass the Hash (T1550.002) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The attackers use the dumped credentials and Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement. Atexec is part of the Impacket suite and allows for executing commands on remote systems. This action is consistent with the technique of Remote Services (T1021) and specifically, using Valid Accounts (T1078) for lateral movement.

4. **Deployment of BlackEnergy’s Network Sniffer Module**: The question asks if it's likely that after these actions, the threat actors would deploy BlackEnergy’s network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network. BlackEnergy is malware known for its use in cyberattacks, including the ability to sniff network traffic. Deploying a network sniffer module would align with the technique of Network Sniffing (T1040) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given the sequence of actions:
- The attackers have already obtained credentials using Mimikatz and have been using them for lateral movement with Impacket tools.
- The use of a network sniffer like BlackEnergy’s module would provide additional capabilities to capture credentials being transmitted over the network, potentially expanding their reach and access within the network.

**Evaluation**:
- The sequence described is technically feasible and aligns with common tactics used by threat actors to expand their access within a compromised network.
- The use of a network sniffer after initial credential dumping and lateral movement could be part of a broader strategy to maximize the discovery of additional credentials and maintain or increase access to the network.

**Conclusion**:
Given the context and the TTPs described, it is plausible that threat actors, after using Mimikatz and Impacket for initial credential dumping and lateral movement, would deploy additional tools like BlackEnergy’s network sniffer module to further discover and exploit network vulnerabilities, including capturing user credentials sent over the network.
