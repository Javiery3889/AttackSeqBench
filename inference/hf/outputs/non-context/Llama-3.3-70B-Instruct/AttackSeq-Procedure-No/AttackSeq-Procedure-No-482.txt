To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Analysis**: The question describes a scenario involving FamousSparrow, a group known for its cyber espionage activities. The scenario includes the use of SparrowDoor for communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server over HTTPS, employing multi-byte XOR keys for encryption.

2. **Identify TTPs**:
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implies the use of SparrowDoor for initial communication.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: Utilizing SparrowDoor for communication with the C&C server via HTTPS, with encrypted communications using multi-byte XOR keys.
   - **Exfiltration**: The question asks about the likelihood of exfiltrating data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - FamousSparrow's modus operandi (MO) involves sophisticated espionage tactics, including the use of custom malware like SparrowDoor for C2 communications.
   - The use of HTTPS for C2 communication is common due to its ability to blend in with normal network traffic, reducing the likelihood of detection.
   - Encrypted communications using multi-byte XOR keys indicate an attempt to protect the content of the communications from interception and understanding by defenders.
   - Scheduled data exfiltration, especially at regular intervals like every 10 minutes, could be a tactic to maintain a steady flow of information back to the attackers without arousing suspicion by causing large, one-time data transfers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: FamousSparrow uses SparrowDoor for encrypted C2 communications, indicating a level of sophistication and intent to maintain stealth.
   - **Step 2**: The use of HTTPS and multi-byte XOR encryption for C2 communications suggests an effort to blend in with normal traffic and protect data.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of espionage and the need for continuous data collection, scheduled exfiltration methods are plausible for maintaining a steady flow of information without detection.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering the sophistication of FamousSparrow's TTPs, including the use of custom malware for encrypted C2 communications, it is reasonable to conclude that they would employ scheduled data exfiltration methods to maintain operational security and achieve their espionage goals.

Final Answer: A
