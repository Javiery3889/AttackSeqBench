To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries like FamousSparrow.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by FamousSparrow, starting with dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz. This action falls under Credential Access (TA0006 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework), which is a common technique used by attackers to gain access to sensitive information.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action is credential dumping, which is part of Credential Access.
   - The subsequent actions mentioned include reading file contents and exfiltrating them to a Command and Control (C&C) server. This would fall under Exfiltration (TA0010) and possibly Collection (TA0009) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The final action mentioned is collecting system information (usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types), which aligns with the Discovery phase (TA0007), aimed at gathering information about the target environment.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes** suggests that after gaining credential access, FamousSparrow would proceed to read and exfiltrate file contents before collecting system information. This sequence implies that the attacker prioritizes gathering specific data (possibly sensitive files) over understanding the broader system environment.
   - **B: No** implies that collecting system information (during the Discovery phase) would occur before or instead of reading and exfiltrating file contents. This sequence suggests that understanding the system environment is a priority, possibly to identify valuable targets for data exfiltration or to plan further actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Typically, after gaining initial access and dumping credentials, an attacker would seek to understand the environment to identify potential targets, vulnerabilities, and the layout of the system. This is a common practice to maximize the impact of the attack and to identify where sensitive data might reside.
   - Collecting system information (Discovery) often precedes more targeted actions like reading specific file contents because it helps in planning and executing the attack more effectively.
   - Exfiltrating data to a C&C server usually occurs after the attacker has identified what data is valuable and accessible.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack and the priorities of an attacker like FamousSparrow, it is more plausible that collecting system information would occur before or instead of immediately exfiltrating specific file contents. This approach allows the attacker to better understand the environment and plan subsequent actions, including targeted data exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
