To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Establishing Command and Control**: The initial step involves TG1021 deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS (Internet Information Services) request handling process. This action allows NodeIISWeb to provide backdoor functionality, which is a method of maintaining access to a compromised system. This technique falls under "Command and Control" (TA0011 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework), specifically using a backdoor (T1219).

2. **Lateral Movement**: The subsequent action involves accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB (Server Message Block) using compromised domain credentials. This is a form of lateral movement (TA0008), where the attacker moves from one system to another within the network. Specifically, this involves using valid accounts (T1078) and exploiting SMB for lateral movement (T1021).

3. **Dropping a Web Shell Loader via SMB**: Finally, the attackers drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement. This action also falls under lateral movement and involves the use of a web shell (T1100), which is a type of backdoor.

Given the sequence of events:
- The attackers first establish a backdoor for command and control.
- Then, they use compromised credentials to move laterally within the network, accessing shared folders over SMB.
- Finally, they drop a web shell loader via SMB to further facilitate lateral movement and maintain access.

**Analysis**:
The sequence described in the question outlines a logical progression of a cyber attack aimed at establishing a foothold, expanding access, and ensuring persistence within a network. The use of compromised domain credentials to access shared folders and drop a web shell loader is a plausible next step after establishing command and control, as it leverages the initial access to further the attackers' goals within the network.

**Conclusion**:
Given the logical progression of the attack and the typical goals of such TTPs (establishing command and control, lateral movement, and persistence), it is indeed likely that after establishing command and control, the attackers would use compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader for lateral movement.
