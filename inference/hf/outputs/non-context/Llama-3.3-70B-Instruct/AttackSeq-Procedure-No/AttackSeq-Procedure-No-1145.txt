To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence of actions.

1. **Identify the Initial Action**: The initial action involves uncovering outdated Building Management systems or medical devices that support the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters. This step suggests that an attacker has already begun reconnaissance, likely looking for vulnerabilities to exploit.

2. **Understand the MQTT Protocol**: MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol often used in IoT devices due to its low bandwidth requirements. Its presence in medical devices or building management systems indicates potential vulnerabilities, especially if these systems are outdated.

3. **Role of Shodan and Censys**: Shodan and Censys are search engines designed for internet-connected devices. They can be used to discover devices and services that are exposed to the internet, including those that might not be intended for public access. These tools are commonly used by security researchers and, unfortunately, also by malicious actors to identify potential targets.

4. **Likelihood of Using Shodan and Censys**: Given that the attackers have already identified potential vulnerabilities in medical networks (outdated systems/devices using MQTT), the next logical step would be to gather more information about the target. Using Shodan and Censys would allow them to discover other publicly available resources of medical organizations that could be exploited. This could include other vulnerable devices, open ports, or services that could be used as entry points for further attacks.

5. **Conclusion**: The sequence of actions described is plausible and aligns with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. After identifying potential vulnerabilities, expanding the search to include all publicly accessible resources using tools like Shodan and Censys is a logical next step to gather more intelligence before deciding on the best approach for an attack.
