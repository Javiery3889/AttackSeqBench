To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the attackers loading a plist file using the launchctl command before inserting malicious JavaScript code.

1. **Understanding the Attack Sequence**: The attack involves inserting malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal. This code redirects victims to an exploit landing page that exploits a vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2019-13720). The question asks if it's likely that before this step, attackers loaded a plist file using the launchctl command.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs**:
   - **Inserting Malicious JavaScript Code**: This is a common tactic used by attackers to redirect users to malicious sites or to execute malicious code on the client-side.
   - **Exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome**: This indicates the attackers are using an exploit for a known vulnerability to potentially gain control over the victim's system or to steal sensitive information.
   - **Loading a plist File Using launchctl**: The `launchctl` command is used on macOS systems to load, unload, or list daemons/agents. A plist (property list) file contains configuration data for these daemons/agents. Loading a plist file could be a way for an attacker to establish persistence or execute malicious code on a macOS system.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence**:
   - The primary goal of the attack seems to be exploiting a vulnerability in Google Chrome to potentially compromise user systems or steal data.
   - The use of `launchctl` to load a plist file is more related to establishing persistence or executing code on a macOS system. This action seems unrelated to the direct exploitation of a Chrome vulnerability or the insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a news portal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the information provided, the attack sequence described (inserting malicious JavaScript to redirect to an exploit landing page for CVE-2019-13720) does not directly relate to the action of loading a plist file using `launchctl`. The latter is more indicative of actions taken on a compromised system to maintain access or execute further malicious code, rather than a step in the initial exploitation process described.

**Final Answer: B**
