To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned, relating them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the behavior of the threat actor or malware in question, referred to as DRAGONFISH.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: achieving persistence via the Run Registry key and injecting hidden DLLs into the Internet Explorer process. 
   - It then asks if DRAGONFISH is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections and query Active Directory for computers.

2. **Identifying TTPs:**
   - **Persistence (T1547: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution)**: Using the Run Registry key for persistence is a common technique where malware ensures it starts whenever the system boots or a user logs on.
   - **DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574)**: Injecting hidden DLLs into a process like Internet Explorer can allow an attacker to execute malicious code in the context of that process.
   - **Remote System Discovery (T1018)**: Discovering systems over LAN connections involves scanning or querying the network to identify potential targets.
   - **Active Directory Discovery (T1207)**: Querying Active Directory for directory information can help an attacker understand the network structure, identify potential targets, and plan further actions.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating:**
   - The initial actions (persistence and DLL injection) suggest that DRAGONFISH is capable of sophisticated operations within a compromised system, including evading detection and potentially escalating privileges.
   - The subsequent actions (remote system discovery and Active Directory queries) are consistent with an attacker attempting to expand their foothold within a network, gather intelligence, and potentially identify additional targets for compromise.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1**: DRAGONFISH has already demonstrated an ability to operate within a system stealthily and maintain persistence.
   - **Step 2**: The injection of DLLs into Internet Explorer indicates a capability to interact with system processes and potentially use them for further malicious activities.
   - **Step 3**: Given the demonstrated capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that DRAGONFISH could leverage its presence within a compromised system to discover other systems on the LAN and query Active Directory.
   - **Step 4**: These actions align with typical post-compromise behaviors aimed at network exploration and expansion, which are common in many cyber attack scenarios.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, DRAGONFISH's demonstrated capabilities, and the typical behaviors of sophisticated malware or threat actors, it is plausible that after achieving initial compromise and persistence, DRAGONFISH would attempt to discover additional systems and gather more information about the network.

Final Answer: A
