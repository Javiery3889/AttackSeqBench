To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario described.

1. **Reconnaissance Activities**: The initial step involves gathering information about the target system. This can include both passive (e.g., gathering publicly available information) and active (e.g., network scanning) methods. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities or entry points.

2. **Establishing Communication with Command-and-Control (C2) Servers**: Typically, after an attacker has gained access to a system, they might establish communication with C2 servers. This communication is crucial for receiving further instructions, downloading additional malware, or exfiltrating data.

3. **Installation through Employee-Enabled Macro Execution**: This involves exploiting a vulnerability where an employee enables macros in a document, which then executes malicious code. This is a common method for installing malware, including implants like BlackEnergy 3, onto a network.

Given these steps, the question asks if it's likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with C2 servers **only before** being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

The sequence described in the question seems to imply that the communication with C2 servers happens before the installation of the malware, which doesn't align with typical attack patterns. Usually, the communication with C2 servers would occur after the malware is installed on the victim's system, as the malware needs to be present on the system to establish this communication.

Therefore, considering the typical lifecycle of a malware attack:
- **Reconnaissance** happens first.
- Then, an **initial infection vector** is used (like employee-enabled macro execution) to install the malware.
- **Post-installation**, the malware (like BlackEnergy 3) would establish communication with C2 servers for further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

Given this, the scenario where BlackEnergy 3 establishes communication with C2 servers **only before** being installed doesn't fit the standard attack sequence. The communication with C2 servers is a post-installation activity, not a pre-installation one.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the standard sequence of attack: Reconnaissance, Initial Infection, Post-Infection Activities (including C2 communication).
2. Evaluate the question's scenario against this standard sequence.
3. Determine the likelihood based on typical malware behavior.

**Final Answer: B**
