To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of FIN13 using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that involve:
   - **Initial Access and Discovery**: Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. This suggests the attackers are already inside the network and are gathering information about the internal environment.
   - **Lateral Movement**: The question posits the use of software deployment tools (like PDQ Deploy) to move AvosLocker (a type of ransomware) and other tools across the network. This would facilitate the spread of malware and potentially other malicious tools for further exploitation.
   - **Collection and Exfiltration**: Collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions. This step involves gathering sensitive data that could be used for financial gain or other malicious purposes.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Native OS Binaries and Custom Malware for Reconnaissance**: This is a common TTP used by sophisticated threat actors to blend in with normal network activity and avoid detection.
   - **Use of Software Deployment Tools for Lateral Movement**: Utilizing legitimate software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for malicious purposes is a known tactic. These tools can help attackers distribute malware or other malicious software across a network efficiently, under the guise of legitimate administrative activity.
   - **AvosLocker and Data Collection**: AvosLocker is a ransomware variant, and its deployment across a network would align with the goal of encrypting data and demanding ransom. Collecting specific data for fraudulent transactions suggests a focused effort to monetize the attack beyond mere ransom demands.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: FIN13, like other sophisticated threat actors, often employs a multi-stage approach to attacks, starting with reconnaissance.
   - **Step 2**: The use of native OS binaries and custom malware for initial reconnaissance is consistent with attempts to remain stealthy and gather detailed information about the target network.
   - **Step 3**: Leveraging software deployment tools for lateral movement is a plausible next step, as it allows for efficient distribution of malware and tools necessary for further exploitation.
   - **Step 4**: The deployment of AvosLocker and collection of specific data for fraudulent transactions align with the financial motivations often associated with such attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
