To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions following the establishment of a Command and Control (C2) channel.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the SombRAT backdoor, associated with the CostaRicto Campaign, has successfully established communication with its C2 servers. This communication is facilitated through protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, which is a technique used to bypass network restrictions and establish a covert channel for command and control. The question then inquires about the likelihood of the backdoor performing process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase of the attack lifecycle.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned include:
   - Establishing a C2 channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP (T1043: Commonly Used Port, T1071: Application Layer Protocol).
   - The potential actions of process discovery (T1005: Data from Local System) and system information discovery (T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery, T1018: Remote System Discovery).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Establishing a C2 Channel**: This is a critical step for attackers to issue commands and receive data from the compromised system. It aligns with the initial stages of an attack after gaining access.
   - **Process Discovery and System Information Discovery**: These actions are part of the Discovery phase (TA0007) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Process discovery involves gathering information about running processes on a system, which can help attackers understand potential security software, running applications, and system services. System information discovery involves collecting details about the system, its configuration, and network settings, which can aid in planning further actions such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has established a C2 channel, indicating they have gained initial access and are looking to further understand the compromised system.
   - **Step 2**: The Discovery phase is a logical next step after establishing a C2 channel. During this phase, attackers seek to gather as much information as possible about the system and its environment to plan subsequent actions.
   - **Step 3**: Process discovery and system information discovery are fundamental actions within the Discovery phase. They provide critical insights into the system's security posture, potential vulnerabilities, and the layout of the network, which are essential for deciding the next steps in the attack.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context that the SombRAT backdoor has established a C2 channel, it is highly plausible that the next steps would involve process discovery and system information discovery. These actions align with the typical behavior of attackers during the Discovery phase of an attack, aiming to gather intelligence on the compromised system to inform further malicious activities.
