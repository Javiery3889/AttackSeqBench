To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the use of a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix for communication with a Command and Control (C2) server. This indicates a method of communication and potentially data encoding used by the malware.
   - It then asks if it's likely that the malware will collect specific types of information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) during the Discovery phase.

2. **Understanding the Discovery Phase**:
   - In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the Discovery phase involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, or environment they are operating in. This can include collecting data about running processes, network connections, user accounts, and more.
   - Collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data can be part of the Discovery phase, especially if the adversary is interested in gathering sensitive information about the user or the device for further exploitation or exfiltration.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that collecting such information is likely during the Discovery phase. Given the context of an adversary already communicating with a C2 server and potentially having access to a compromised device, it's plausible they would attempt to gather more information about the device and its user.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that collecting such specific types of information is not likely during the Discovery phase. However, given the nature of the Discovery phase and the goals of an adversary, this seems less likely unless the malware's primary function does not involve data exfiltration or surveillance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware is already communicating with a C2 server, indicating a level of compromise.
   - The use of a Base64-encoded token suggests an attempt to obscure communication, which is common in malicious activities.
   - The Discovery phase is about gathering information, and the types of data mentioned (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) are valuable for an adversary looking to exploit the device or user further.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that during the Discovery phase, the malware would attempt to collect as much relevant information as possible, including the types mentioned.

**Final Answer: A**
