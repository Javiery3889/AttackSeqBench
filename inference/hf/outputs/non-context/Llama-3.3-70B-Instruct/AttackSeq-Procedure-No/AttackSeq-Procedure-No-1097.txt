To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the typical behaviors associated with CosmicDuke, a known malware.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions where, after exfiltrating data via FTP, the attacker uses specific tools (keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer) to gather more information. This sequence also mentions searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.

2. **Understanding CosmicDuke**: CosmicDuke is a type of malware known for its capabilities in stealing sensitive information from compromised systems. Its toolkit often includes keyloggers, screenshot capture, and the ability to steal data from the clipboard. These tools are typically used to gather as much information as possible from the infected system.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence**: 
   - **Exfiltration via FTP**: This step involves transferring stolen data from the compromised system to the attacker's servers. It's a common method used by various malware types, including CosmicDuke, to move stolen data out of the target network.
   - **Use of Keylogger, Screenshotter, and Clipboard Stealer**: These are information-gathering tools. A keylogger records keystrokes, a screenshotter captures screenshots, and a clipboard stealer monitors and steals data copied to the clipboard. These actions are consistent with the goals of CosmicDuke, which aims to collect sensitive information.
   - **Searching Removable Drives and Skipping Certain File Types**: This behavior indicates a targeted approach to data collection, focusing on specific data locations (removable drives) and possibly avoiding certain file types to either evade detection or focus on high-value data.

4. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Given the capabilities and goals of CosmicDuke, using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after initial data exfiltration aligns with its information-gathering objectives. The specific actions of searching removable drives and selectively collecting files based on type also fit within the context of targeted data theft, which CosmicDuke is designed for.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical behaviors and capabilities of CosmicDuke, it is plausible that after exfiltrating collected data, the malware would continue to gather information using the mentioned tools, especially as part of a broader effort to collect as much sensitive data as possible from the compromised system.
