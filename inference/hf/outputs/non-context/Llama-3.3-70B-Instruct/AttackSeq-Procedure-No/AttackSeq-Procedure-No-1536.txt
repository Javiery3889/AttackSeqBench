To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the situation based on the information provided and the typical behaviors of malware and rootkits, particularly those like LoJax, which is known for its persistence and evasion capabilities.

1. **Understanding the Components**:
   - **'versioninfo.bat' script**: This script is mentioned as discovering system details and collecting information for exfiltration. This action aligns with the initial stages of an attack, where an adversary gathers information about the target system to plan further actions.
   - **UEFI rootkit such as LoJax**: LoJax is a known UEFI rootkit that can persist on a system even after a full disk wipe and operating system reinstallation. Rootkits, by design, aim to hide malicious activity and maintain access to a compromised system.

2. **Analyzing the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - The initial action involves information gathering and collection, which is a common first step in many cyber attacks. This is often followed by actions to maintain access, evade detection, and possibly expand privileges or move laterally within a network.
   - The use of a UEFI rootkit like LoJax indicates an advanced level of persistence and evasion capability. Such rootkits can indeed manage files on the system to avoid detection, including deleting temporary or trace files left behind by other malicious tools.

3. **Evaluating the Plausibility**:
   - Given that LoJax is designed for persistence and evasion, it is plausible that after the initial information gathering phase (potentially conducted by tools like 'versioninfo.bat'), a UEFI rootkit could manage the deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to remove evidence of the initial compromise and maintain stealth.
   - This behavior aligns with the tactics of sophisticated adversaries who seek to minimize their footprint on a compromised system to avoid detection by security tools and incident responders.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the capabilities of UEFI rootkits like LoJax and the typical goals of attackers to remain undetected, it is reasonable to conclude that after the initial information gathering, a UEFI rootkit could indeed manage the deletion of files to evade detection.
