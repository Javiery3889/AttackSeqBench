To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the next step being the deployment of CaddyWiper for wiping files and physical drive partitions.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes a scenario where a backdoor, installed by attackers, is used to exfiltrate data over a Command and Control (C&C) channel. This exfiltration is done using encrypted communication, which suggests a level of sophistication in the attack to evade detection.
   - The question then asks about the likelihood of the next step being the deployment of CaddyWiper, a known wiper malware, to wipe files related to Operational Technology (OT) capabilities and physical drive partitions.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Exfiltration of Data**: The initial step of exfiltrating data via a backdoor over an encrypted C&C channel indicates a focused effort to steal specific information without immediate disruption, suggesting the attackers are interested in gathering intelligence or sensitive data.
   - **Deployment of CaddyWiper**: CaddyWiper is a malware designed to destroy data, making it a tool for sabotage rather than espionage. Its deployment would indicate a shift from stealthy data theft to a more destructive phase of the attack, potentially aimed at disrupting the target's operations or destroying evidence of the attack.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have already demonstrated the capability and intent to infiltrate the system, install a backdoor, and exfiltrate data. This shows a level of access and control that could be leveraged for further malicious activities.
   - **Step 2**: The use of encrypted communication for data exfiltration suggests the attackers are trying to maintain access without being detected, at least until their primary objectives are achieved.
   - **Step 3**: Deploying CaddyWiper would be a logical next step if the attackers' goals include not just data theft but also disruption or destruction of the target's capabilities, especially if they believe their presence has been or will soon be discovered.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the context and the nature of the TTPs described, it is plausible that after exfiltrating data, the attackers might proceed to deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files and physical drive partitions, especially if their objectives include sabotage or if they are attempting to cover their tracks by destroying evidence and disrupting the target's ability to respond effectively.

**Final Answer: A**
