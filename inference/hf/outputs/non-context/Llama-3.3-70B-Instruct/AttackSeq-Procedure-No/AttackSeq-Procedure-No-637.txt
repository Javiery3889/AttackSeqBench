To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence of actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware, particularly focusing on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Communication with C2 Servers**: The PIVY variant communicates with Command & Control (C2) servers. This action aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic (TA0011) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary establishes communication with compromised systems to issue commands.

2. **Use of Application Layer Protocols**: The use of application layer protocols for C2 communication is a common technique (T1071 - Application Layer Protocol) that allows malware to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.

3. **DLL Sideloading**: The question mentions the malware using DLL sideloading to load a dropped DLL. DLL sideloading is a technique (T1574.001 - DLL Side-Loading: DLL Side-Loading) where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL. This technique is often used to evade defenses by making the malicious activity appear as part of a legitimate process.

4. **Modifying Configuration to Confuse Tools**: Modifying its configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data can be seen as part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic (TA0005), specifically techniques like T1112 - Modify Registry or T1562.003 - Modify System Configuration, where an adversary modifies system or application settings to evade detection.

Given these points, the sequence described involves:
- Establishing C2 communication (a common initial step for many malware types).
- Using a known evasion technique (DLL sideloading) to execute malicious code under the guise of a legitimate process.
- Modifying configuration to evade detection, which aligns with common defense evasion tactics.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of malware operations and the tactics commonly employed by adversaries to evade detection, it is plausible that after communicating with C2 servers, the malware would attempt to evade defenses by using techniques like DLL sideloading and modifying its configuration.
