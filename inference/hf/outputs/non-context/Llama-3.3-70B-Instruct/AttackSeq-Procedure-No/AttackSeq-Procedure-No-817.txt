To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in evaluating the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and determine the most plausible sequence based on common attack patterns and the characteristics of malware like WinDealer.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question involves a malware (WinDealer) that is suspected to communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers using non-standard ports (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556), followed by stealing information from Social Network Service (SNS) applications, and then encrypting the stolen data using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Initial Communication**: WinDealer communicates with C2 servers.
   - **Data Exfiltration**: Steals information from SNS applications.
   - **Data Encryption**: Encrypts the stolen data using AES.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - Malware often communicates with C2 servers to receive commands or send stolen data. Using non-standard ports is a common technique to evade detection by traditional security measures that monitor standard ports.
   - Stealing information from SNS applications is a plausible action for malware aimed at data exfiltration, as these platforms contain valuable personal and potentially sensitive information.
   - Encrypting stolen data with AES before exfiltration is a common practice to protect the data from being intercepted and read during transmission.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: WinDealer's communication with C2 servers using non-standard ports is a tactic used by malware to avoid detection. This is a plausible initial step.
   - **Step 2**: The theft of information from SNS applications aligns with the goals of data exfiltration malware.
   - **Step 3**: Encrypting the stolen data with AES is a logical step to secure the data during transmission back to the C2 servers.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question follows a logical and common pattern for malware operations: initial communication for command and control, data theft, and then encryption of the stolen data for secure exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A**
