To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: The threat actors exploited CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells. This is a known vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint that allows remote code execution, which can be used for initial access (TA0001) by installing a webshell.

2. **Webshell Installation**: The use of webshells like AntSword is a technique (T1100) under the tactic of Execution (TA0002) but initially falls under the Persistence (TA0003) tactic as it allows attackers to maintain access. AntSword is a webshell that can be used to execute commands on a compromised system.

3. **Discovery**: The question mentions discovering files and folders on the compromised system and then executing commands for system and user discovery. This aligns with the Discovery tactic (TA0007), which includes techniques for discovering local system information (T1018) and system network configuration discovery (T1016), among others.

Given this sequence:
- The initial exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 for installing a webshell aligns with gaining initial access.
- Using a webshell like AntSword to run commands for discovering files, folders, system information, and user details is a plausible next step. This is because, after gaining initial access, attackers typically seek to understand the environment they are operating in, which includes discovering what files and folders are present, what users exist, and what the system's configuration and network settings are.

Therefore, it is logical that after installing a webshell for initial access, threat actors would use it to run commands aimed at discovery before potentially moving on to other tactics like lateral movement, privilege escalation, or exfiltration.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 for initial access via webshell installation.
2. Utilization of the webshell (e.g., AntSword) for command execution.
3. Execution of commands for discovery purposes (files, folders, system, and user discovery).

**Final Answer: A**
