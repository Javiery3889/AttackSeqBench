To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Deep Panda, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.

1. **Initial Access via Log4Shell Vulnerability**: The Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) in Apache Log4j is a remote code execution vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. Deep Panda, like other APT groups, has been known to exploit high-impact vulnerabilities for initial access. Therefore, exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers for initial access is plausible.

2. **Ensuring Persistence**: After gaining initial access, ensuring persistence is a critical step for any APT group, including Deep Panda. This involves creating mechanisms to maintain access to the compromised system even after restarts or other events that might terminate their access. The described method of copying the Milestone backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a registry-based service named `msupdate2` is a common approach for achieving persistence. Malware and backdoors are often placed in directories like `%APPDATA%` to blend in with legitimate applications, and creating a registry entry for a service can allow the malware to start automatically upon system boot.

3. **Executing PowerShell Scripts and Batch Files**: The execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files for downloading and running additional files is consistent with the tactics used by many APT groups, including Deep Panda. PowerShell is particularly popular among attackers due to its powerful capabilities for interacting with the Windows operating system and its ability to execute scripts without leaving behind malware binaries on disk.

Given these points, the sequence described aligns well with known TTPs of APT groups like Deep Panda. The initial exploitation of a known vulnerability for access, followed by establishing persistence through backdoor installation and registry modification, and then using scripts for further malicious activity, represents a coherent and plausible attack sequence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- **Exploitation of Log4Shell**: Plausible initial access vector.
- **Persistence Mechanism**: Copying a backdoor to a common application directory and creating a registry-based service for persistence is a known TTP.
- **Execution of Scripts**: Using PowerShell and batch files for further malicious activities is consistent with observed behaviors of APT groups.

**Final Answer: A**
