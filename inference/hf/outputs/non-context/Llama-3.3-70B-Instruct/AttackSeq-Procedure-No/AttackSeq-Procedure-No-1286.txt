To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Turla.

1. **Establishing a Hidden Foothold**: This involves creating a persistent presence within a network, often through backdoors or other means of covert access. This is a common initial step for APT groups aiming to maintain long-term access to a target network.

2. **Searching Other Computers and Storing Stolen Information**: After gaining access, APT groups like Turla would likely move laterally within the network to identify valuable data, which they would then exfiltrate and store, possibly on compromised servers or through encrypted channels.

3. **Setting Auto-Forward Rules on Victim's E-mail Accounts**: This technique involves manipulating email settings to automatically forward emails to an address controlled by the attackers. This can be used for ongoing surveillance and data collection, fitting into the broader strategy of gathering intelligence and maintaining access.

4. **Updating Command and Control (C2) Servers**: APT groups regularly update their C2 infrastructure to maintain control over compromised systems, evade detection, and ensure the continuity of their operations. This can involve changing server locations, using new domains, or employing different communication protocols.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after establishing a foothold and collecting data, Turla operators would indeed set auto-forward rules to continue collecting data and then update their C2 servers. This sequence aligns with typical APT behavior, where maintaining access, collecting intelligence, and adapting infrastructure are key objectives.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that Turla operators would not engage in these activities in sequence, which contradicts the known TTPs of sophisticated APT groups like Turla.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Turla's initial actions of establishing a foothold and collecting data are consistent with APT tactics aimed at gaining persistent access and gathering intelligence.
2. Setting auto-forward rules on email accounts is a plausible next step for ongoing surveillance and data collection, fitting the pattern of maintaining access and gathering more information.
3. Updating C2 servers worldwide is a logical subsequent action to ensure continued control over infected systems and to adapt to potential detection efforts.

**Final Answer: A**
