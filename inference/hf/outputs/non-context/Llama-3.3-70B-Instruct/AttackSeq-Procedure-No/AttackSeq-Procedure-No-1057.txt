To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Leveraging an obfuscated batch script to execute a PowerShell script (myScript.ps1):** This action suggests an initial access or execution tactic where an attacker uses a script to run another script, likely to evade detection or to use PowerShell's capabilities for further exploitation. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1059) or "Obfuscated Files or Information" (T1027).

2. **Establishing command and control (C2) with njRAT:** njRAT is a remote access trojan that allows attackers to control a victim's computer remotely. Establishing C2 is a key step in maintaining control over the compromised system, aligning with the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Application Layer Protocol" (T1071) or "Standard Application Layer Protocol" (T1071.001).

Given these steps, the attacker has already gained access to the system, executed scripts to potentially prepare the environment, and established a means of remote control. The next logical steps for an attacker would typically involve maintaining access to the compromised system to ensure they can continue to use it for their purposes without being detected or removed. This involves actions to maintain persistence.

**Persistence** in the MITRE ATT&CK framework refers to techniques that attackers use to keep access to a system or network over time. Common persistence techniques include creating or modifying system files (T1134), adding new services (T1050), or modifying existing services (T1050), among others.

Given the context provided:
- The attacker has already demonstrated the capability to execute scripts and establish command and control.
- The logical next step after establishing control would be to ensure that access is not lost, which involves maintaining persistence.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing command and control, an attacker would likely take actions to maintain persistence.
