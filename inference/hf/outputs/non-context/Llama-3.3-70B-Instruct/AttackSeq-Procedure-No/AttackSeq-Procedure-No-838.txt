To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate its plausibility based on known behaviors of APT28 and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing**: APT28 is known for using spear-phishing campaigns as an initial access vector. This involves sending targeted emails, often with malicious attachments or links, to gain access to a target network. The mention of delivering "exploit documents" aligns with this TTP, as these documents can contain exploits for vulnerabilities in software like Microsoft Office, which can lead to code execution when opened.

2. **Installation and Execution of VBA Script (vba_macro.exe)**: The use of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros in Microsoft Office documents is a common technique for executing malicious code on a victim's machine. APT28 and other threat actors have been known to use malicious macros to drop and execute malware. The mention of dropping malware like FONTCACHE.DAT fits within the context of using VBA scripts to execute malicious code, as FONTCACHE.DAT could be a custom or known malware used in such campaigns.

3. **Leveraging Tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE**: These tools are not as widely recognized or documented in public sources as some other malware or tools, but their use in the context of APT28 operations suggests they could be custom or less-discussed tools used for various purposes such as command and control (C2), lateral movement, or exfiltration. APT28 is known for using a variety of custom and publicly available tools during their operations, so the use of these tools does not seem out of character.

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with known behaviors of APT28:
- **Initial Access** through spear-phishing and exploit documents.
- **Execution** of malicious code through VBA scripts (like vba_macro.exe) to drop malware.
- **Use of Custom Tools** for further operations, which could include command and control, persistence, or data exfiltration.

Therefore, the sequence described is plausible and consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that APT28 has been known to employ.
