To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence in relation to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with the Lazarus group and the deployment of ransomware like Hermes.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of events involving the deployment of Hermes ransomware to disrupt a bank's operations, followed by the potential use of backdoor malware for communication with command-and-control (C2) servers and the execution of remote commands.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Initial TTP**: Deployment of Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, aiming to disrupt operations.
   - **Subsequent TTP in Question**: Use of backdoor malware for C2 communication and remote command execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of ransomware like Hermes to disrupt operations and delete backups is a known TTP, often used to extort money from victims or to cause chaos.
   - The deployment of backdoor malware for communicating with C2 servers and executing remote commands is a common TTP used by advanced threat actors, including the Lazarus group, to maintain access to compromised systems and execute further malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial action of deploying Hermes ransomware aligns with disruptive and destructive TTPs, which could be a smokescreen for more targeted activities or a means to an end for financial gain or disruption.
   - **Step 2**: The subsequent use of backdoor malware for C2 communication and remote command execution would logically follow the initial disruption, as it allows the attackers to leverage the compromised state of the system for further exploitation, which could include data exfiltration, lateral movement, or additional malicious activities.
   - **Step 3**: Considering the Lazarus group's history of sophisticated and multi-staged attacks, it's plausible that they would use backdoor malware after the initial disruption caused by the ransomware to achieve their objectives, which might not be limited to the ransomware's effects alone.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs involved, it's reasonable to conclude that the Lazarus group could have used backdoor malware after deploying the Hermes ransomware to communicate with C2 servers and execute remote commands, as this aligns with known sophisticated attack patterns.
