To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker first steals stored passwords and access tokens. This is typically done to gain unauthorized access or to escalate privileges within a system. The techniques mentioned, Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry, are part of the Credential Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. After gaining access, the question suggests the use of T1107 (File Deletion) as a defense evasion technique, followed by the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.

2. **Understanding TTPs**:
   - **Credential Dumping**: Involves obtaining password hashes or credentials from the operating system or software.
   - **Credentials in Registry**: Refers to obtaining credentials stored in the Windows Registry.
   - **T1107 (File Deletion)**: A defense evasion technique where an attacker deletes files to hide their tracks or evade detection.
   - **CVE-2017-11882**: A vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows for remote code execution without user interaction, under certain conditions.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence**:
   - The initial actions (Credential Dumping and accessing Credentials in Registry) are aimed at gaining access or escalating privileges.
   - The use of T1107 (File Deletion) as a defense evasion technique could logically follow if the attacker wants to cover their tracks after accessing sensitive information or before executing malicious code to avoid detection by security software or system administrators.
   - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution aligns with the goal of maintaining stealth and achieving malicious objectives without alerting the user.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the context, using T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion before exploiting a vulnerability like CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution is a plausible sequence of TTPs. This sequence suggests an attacker attempting to minimize detection while exploiting vulnerabilities to achieve their objectives.

**Final Answer: A**
