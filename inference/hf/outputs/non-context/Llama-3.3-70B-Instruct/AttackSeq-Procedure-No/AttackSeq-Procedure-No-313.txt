To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Defense Evasion Tactic**: The use of self-deleting code is a technique (T1045 - Software Packing, or more specifically, T1070 - Indicator Removal on Host) under the defense evasion tactic. This technique is used to evade detection by removing indicators of compromise.

2. **Lateral Movement Tactic**: Using the remote-desktop protocol (RDP) for lateral movement is a technique (T1021 - Remote Services) under the lateral movement tactic. This allows attackers to move between systems, potentially exploiting weak passwords or vulnerabilities in RDP configurations.

3. **Discovery Tactic**: Focusing on Windows systems to gather system information (T1018 - Remote System Discovery, T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery) is part of the discovery tactic. This involves techniques used to gather information about the system, its users, and its configuration.

Given the sequence of TTPs:
- The Dragonfly group starts by evading defenses using self-deleting code.
- Then, they use RDP for lateral movement, which implies they are moving within a network or between systems.
- Finally, they focus on gathering system information on Windows systems as part of their discovery efforts.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Infection and Defense Evasion**: The use of self-deleting code indicates an attempt to remain stealthy and avoid detection, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
2. **Lateral Movement**: Utilizing RDP for lateral movement is plausible after initial infection, as it allows attackers to expand their reach within a network or between systems without relying on exploiting vulnerabilities in other services.
3. **Discovery**: Gathering system information on Windows systems aligns with the goal of understanding the network layout, identifying potential targets, and planning further actions, such as data exfiltration or disruption.

Considering these steps, the sequence described in the question forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence. The Dragonfly group, known for their sophisticated attacks, could indeed use such a sequence to infiltrate, move laterally, and gather information within a targeted network.

**Final Answer: A**
