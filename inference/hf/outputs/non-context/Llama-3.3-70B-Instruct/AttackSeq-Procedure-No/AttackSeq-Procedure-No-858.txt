To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Credential Access**: The question starts with the Explosive Trojan leveraging keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords. This falls under Credential Access (TA0006), specifically using keylogging (T1056) to capture credentials.

2. **Lateral Movement**: The question then mentions the abuse of a compromised Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server's SAML token for Lateral Movement. This aligns with the technique of using forged authentication tokens (T1550) for lateral movement, which is a common method to move laterally within a network, especially after gaining initial access and credentials.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: Finally, the question mentions employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control. This is consistent with establishing and maintaining a C2 channel (TA0011), which could involve using various protocols and architectures to communicate with compromised systems.

Given this sequence:
- **Initial Access** and **Credential Access** through keylogging provide the necessary credentials for further movement.
- **Lateral Movement** using a compromised AD FS server's SAML token is a plausible next step, as it leverages the gained credentials for deeper network access.
- **Command and Control** via a multi-tiered server backend framework is a logical step after establishing a foothold and moving laterally, as it allows for sustained control and potential further exploitation.

Considering the logical progression from gaining initial access, moving laterally, and then establishing command and control, the described sequence of TTPs is coherent with known attack patterns.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial action (keylogging for credential access) is a common method for gaining access to sensitive information.
2. The subsequent use of a compromised AD FS server for lateral movement is a sophisticated but plausible step, given the context of already compromised credentials.
3. The final step of establishing a command and control channel through a multi-tiered server backend framework is consistent with the goal of maintaining access and control over the compromised network.

**Final Answer: A**
