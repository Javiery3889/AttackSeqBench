To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence of events based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware uses HTTPS for command and control (C2) communications. This is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by attackers to maintain stealthy and reliable communication with compromised systems. The use of HTTPS for C2 is categorized under the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Application Layer Protocol" technique.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs in question involves:
   - Establishing C2 communication using HTTPS.
   - Executing a command to discover system information and process lists using 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Establishing C2 Communication**: The use of HTTPS for C2 is a common method for malware to communicate with its command and control servers without being easily detected. This is because HTTPS traffic is encrypted and often not inspected by security devices, making it a covert channel for malicious communications.
   - **Discovering System Information**: After establishing a foothold in a system, the next logical step for an attacker (or malware) is to gather information about the system. This includes understanding the system's configuration, running processes, and network connections to plan further actions, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' is a straightforward way to achieve this, as it lists running processes and provides detailed system information, respectively.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware establishes a secure communication channel using HTTPS, which is a common initial step for many types of malware to receive commands and send back stolen data or system information.
   - **Step 2**: Once the communication channel is established, the malware would logically proceed to gather system information to understand its environment. This could include executing system commands to list running processes and gather system details.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of the malware using HTTPS for C2 and the subsequent action of discovering system information, it is plausible that the malware would use a command like 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to gather this information. This aligns with typical attacker TTPs post-compromise, where understanding the system and its processes is crucial for further exploitation.

**Final Answer: A**
