To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically employed by threat actors, particularly those associated with nation-state attacks.

1. **Initial Access through Phishing**: The use of phishing attacks via email and social media to gain initial access is a common TTP. This method is often used to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or to execute malicious code that grants the attackers access to the target's system. This aligns with the "Phishing" technique under the Initial Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Targeting Individuals Involved in Sanctions**: The fact that the attackers targeted individuals involved in sanctions against Iran suggests a high degree of specificity and intent. This implies that the attackers had done some level of reconnaissance to identify and prioritize their targets.

3. **Scanning of Target IP Addresses**: After gaining initial access, scanning specific lists of target IP addresses would be a logical next step for several reasons:
   - **Reconnaissance**: Scanning IP addresses helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities, open ports, and services running on the target systems. This information is crucial for planning the next stages of the attack, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or exfiltration of sensitive data.
   - **Tailoring the Targeting Approach**: By scanning IP addresses, attackers can refine their understanding of the target environment, identifying specific systems or data that are of high value to their objectives. This could include databases containing information on sanctions, communication networks, or other strategic assets.

Given these considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access, scanning specific lists of target IP addresses would be a plausible and likely step for the attackers. This action aligns with the "Network Service Scanning" technique under the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is used to gather information about the target environment.
