To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Scanning for Machines**: The initial step involves scanning the target's network environment. This is typically a reconnaissance phase where attackers use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan to identify potential targets and open ports. This aligns with the "Reconnaissance" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Network Service Scanning" technique.

2. **Gathering Account Credentials**: The next step mentioned is gathering account credentials via a BlackEnergy keylogger plugin. This action falls under the "Credential Access" tactic, where attackers aim to obtain credentials that can be used for further access. Using a keylogger is a specific technique to capture credentials as they are typed by the user.

3. **Exploiting Remote Services for Lateral Movement**: After obtaining credentials, the attackers plan to exploit remote services to move laterally within the network. This aligns with the "Lateral Movement" tactic, specifically exploiting remote services to gain access to additional systems within the network.

Given this sequence:
- The initial scanning is a common first step to identify potential vulnerabilities and targets.
- Gathering account credentials, such as through a keylogger, provides the means to access systems and services.
- Exploiting remote services using obtained credentials is a logical next step for lateral movement.

Considering the logical progression of these TTPs and their alignment with common attack patterns, it is plausible that after scanning and identifying targets, an attacker like Earth Lusca would attempt to gather credentials to facilitate further movement within the network.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question outlines a sequence starting with network scanning.
2. The use of a keylogger to gather credentials is a feasible next step after identifying potential targets.
3. With credentials in hand, exploiting remote services for lateral movement is a logical progression of the attack.

**Final Answer: A**
