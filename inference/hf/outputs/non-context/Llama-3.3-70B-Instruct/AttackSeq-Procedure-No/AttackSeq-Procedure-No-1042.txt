To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of using external proxy techniques for maintaining Command and Control (C2).

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions POWERSHOWER, which is likely a malware or a tool used by an adversary, collecting system information and sending it to a Command and Control (C2) server. This action implies that the adversary has already gained access to the target system and is in the process of establishing or has established a C2 channel. The question then asks about the likelihood of using external proxy techniques, such as compromising residential endpoints to relay command traffic, as part of maintaining this C2.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence mentioned involves:
   - Collecting system information.
   - Sending the information to a C2 server.
   - The potential use of external proxy techniques for maintaining C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Using External Proxy Techniques**: This technique is often employed by adversaries to obscure the origin of C2 traffic, making it harder for defenders to detect and block the communication between the compromised system and the C2 server. Compromising residential endpoints to relay command traffic is a method used to proxy C2 communications, adding a layer of anonymity and complexity to the attack.
   - **Maintaining C2**: For an adversary, maintaining reliable and covert C2 is crucial for the success of the operation. Using proxies, especially those that are dynamically changing (like compromised residential endpoints), can help in evading detection by traditional security measures that rely on static IP blocking or known C2 server identification.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The adversary has already established a means to collect and send system information to a C2 server, indicating an existing C2 channel.
   - **Step 2**: To maintain this C2 channel and continue receiving commands without being detected, the adversary would likely seek to obscure the traffic.
   - **Step 3**: Using external proxy techniques, such as compromising residential endpoints, is a plausible next step for maintaining anonymity and ensuring the longevity of the C2 channel.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the need for adversaries to maintain covert C2 channels, using external proxy techniques aligns with common TTPs observed in the wild. Therefore, it is likely that after establishing a C2 channel, an adversary would use such techniques to maintain Command and Control.
