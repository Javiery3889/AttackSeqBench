To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of Korplug, a known malware, in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and general cybersecurity principles.

1. **Data Exfiltration via Compressed and Encrypted TCP Messages**: This indicates that the malware (Korplug) has already established a method for communicating with its Command and Control (C&C) servers, using encrypted and compressed data to evade detection. This behavior aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" technique.

2. **Collecting Metadata and Content from All Mapped Drives, Removable Media, and Network Shared Drives**: This action suggests that the malware is engaged in the "Collection" tactic, aiming to gather sensitive information from the compromised system and its connected storage devices. This is a common behavior for malware seeking to steal valuable data.

3. **Communication with C&C Servers Using a Custom TCP-Based Protocol Over Non-Standard Ports**: Malware often uses custom protocols and non-standard ports to communicate with C&C servers to evade detection by traditional security measures that monitor standard ports and protocols. This behavior is consistent with the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given these points, the question essentially asks if, after exfiltrating data, Korplug would likely communicate with its C&C servers using a custom protocol over non-standard ports specifically after collecting data from various sources. 

The key here is understanding the typical behavior of malware like Korplug. Malware often communicates with C&C servers at various stages of its operation, including after data collection and exfiltration, to receive further instructions, upload stolen data, or download additional payloads. The use of custom protocols over non-standard ports is a common evasion technique.

Therefore, considering the behaviors described:
- **Step 1**: Korplug has already demonstrated the capability to communicate with C&C servers for data exfiltration.
- **Step 2**: Collecting metadata and content is a preparatory step for further exfiltration or for fulfilling the mission of the malware.
- **Step 3**: The use of a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports for C&C communication is plausible and aligns with evasion techniques.

**Conclusion**: Given the context and the behaviors attributed to Korplug, it is reasonable to conclude that after performing data exfiltration, Korplug would indeed likely communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports, especially after collecting metadata and content from various sources, as this aligns with typical malware behavior aimed at evading detection and fulfilling its mission.
