To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where employees have been socially engineered into enabling macros, which led to the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware. After the malware installation, but before the adversaries started using plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement, we need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely facilitated communication between the malware and an external server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Social engineering to install malware (BlackEnergy 3).
   - The malware communicating with an external server (the step we're trying to identify).
   - Using plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between malware and the adversary's command and control (C2) server. This communication is crucial for the malware to receive instructions and send back stolen data or other information.
   - **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system or network they have compromised. While important, it doesn't directly involve communication with an external server for the purpose of controlling the malware.
   - **Impact (C)**: This tactic is about the adversary's actions to disrupt or manipulate the system or data. It's more about the effects the adversary wants to achieve rather than the communication mechanism itself.
   - **Collection (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information relevant to the adversary's goals. While collection does involve sending data back to the adversary, the primary focus of this tactic is on the gathering of information rather than the communication mechanism itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically asks about facilitating communication between the malware and an external server. This implies we are looking for a tactic that directly involves the establishment or maintenance of this communication channel.
   - Command and Control is the tactic that directly addresses the need for communication between the malware (in this case, BlackEnergy 3) and the external server controlled by the adversaries.
   - The other options, while relevant to the overall attack sequence, do not directly address the communication aspect as specifically as Command and Control does.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the focus on communication between the malware and an external server, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is Command and Control.

Final Answer: A
