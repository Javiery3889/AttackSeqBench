To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers used spear-phishing emails with environment-based evasion techniques but before ensuring startup persistence through registry modifications using the CT/NewCT implant, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Initial Attack Vector - Spear Phishing**: The attack starts with spear-phishing emails. This is a common initial access tactic (TA0001) used by attackers to gain an initial foothold into a network. The use of environment-based evasion techniques suggests the attackers are attempting to avoid detection by tailoring their phishing emails to the specific environment or context of the target, increasing the likelihood of a successful phishing attempt.

2. **Environment-Based Evasion Techniques**: This indicates the attackers are employing tactics to evade detection, possibly by making their phishing emails appear more legitimate or by using techniques that are less likely to trigger security controls. This aligns with defense evasion (TA0005) tactics, which involve techniques used to evade detection and bypass security controls.

3. **Ensuring Startup Persistence through Registry Modifications**: The attackers then use the CT/NewCT implant to modify the registry for persistence. This is a clear example of the persistence tactic (TA0003), where attackers aim to maintain their access to the system even after the system is restarted or the user logs out.

Given these steps, we need to identify which tactic most likely occurred between the initial phishing attempt (with defense evasion) and the persistence tactic (ensuring startup persistence). Let's evaluate the options:

- **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, such as network and system details. While discovery is a crucial phase in the attack lifecycle, it doesn't directly follow from the initial evasion techniques used in phishing and doesn't necessarily precede persistence in a linear fashion. Discovery can happen at various stages of an attack.

- **B: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another within the network. While lateral movement is a common tactic after initial access, the question focuses on the sequence leading up to persistence, not necessarily the expansion of access within the network.

- **C: Persistence**: This is the tactic of maintaining access to a system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before ensuring startup persistence, so this is not the correct answer since persistence is the outcome described.

- **D: Defense Evasion**: Given that the initial phase already involved defense evasion (through environment-based evasion techniques in the phishing emails), and considering the attackers' goal to maintain access (persistence), defense evasion continues to be relevant. Attackers often continue to use defense evasion techniques throughout their operation to remain undetected, especially when establishing persistence mechanisms.

Considering the sequence and the tactics involved, the most plausible answer is **D: Defense Evasion**, as it aligns with the ongoing need for attackers to evade detection not just during the initial access phase but also as they establish persistence. Defense evasion techniques can be used to hide the persistence mechanisms themselves, ensuring the attackers' continued access without being detected.

Final Answer: D
