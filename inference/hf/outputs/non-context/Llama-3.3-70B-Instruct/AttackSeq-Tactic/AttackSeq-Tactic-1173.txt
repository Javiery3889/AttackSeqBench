To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the sequence of events described, relating them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Lazarus group using backdoor malware to execute remote commands during the FEIB heist. This implies that the attackers have already gained access to the target system and are now communicating with command and control (C2) servers. The key TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned here involve:
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied as the attackers are already inside the system.
   - **Execution**: The use of backdoor malware to execute remote commands.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: Maintaining communication with C2 servers.

2. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Credential Access (A)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems or services. While it's a common tactic, the question doesn't directly imply that credential access is the immediate next step after executing remote commands via backdoor malware.
   - **Impact (B)**: This tactic involves causing an effect on the target, such as data manipulation, disruption, or destruction. Given that the attackers are executing remote commands, they are likely in a position to cause impact, making this a plausible next step.
   - **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a target system. The question already states that the attackers are executing remote commands, so while execution is happening, it's not necessarily the next distinct tactic in the sequence.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic is already being utilized as the attackers are maintaining communication with C2 servers. The question seems to be asking for the next step after this communication is established.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have gained access and are executing commands remotely.
   - They are communicating with C2 servers, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - The next logical step, given they have control and are executing commands, would be to cause an effect or achieve their objective, which aligns with the Impact tactic.

**Final Answer: B**
