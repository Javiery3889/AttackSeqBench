To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with gaining initial access via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros. This technique falls under "Initial Access" (TA0001) in the ATT&CK framework, specifically "Phishing" (T1566) or "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1566.001) if the document was sent via email.

2. **Execution**: The use of embedded macros in Excel documents to execute malicious code aligns with the "Execution" tactic (TA0002). This is because the macro, when enabled by the user, executes the malicious code, allowing the attacker to run their code on the victim's system.

3. **Persistence**: The question mentions that after initial access, a backdoor program employed persistence by writing startup items. This directly refers to the "Persistence" tactic (TA0003), specifically the technique "Startup Items" (T1547.001), where malware is set to execute at startup to maintain its presence on the system.

Given the sequence of events:
- Initial access is gained.
- Malicious code is executed (via the macro).
- A backdoor program achieves persistence.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **before** the backdoor program employed persistence by writing startup items. Since the backdoor's persistence is a method to maintain access after initial execution, the tactic that must occur before persistence in this context is the execution of the malicious code that allows the backdoor to be installed or activated.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access is gained through malicious documents.
2. The malicious code (macro) is executed, which falls under "Execution".
3. After execution, for the backdoor to achieve persistence, it must first be executed and then configure itself to start at system startup.

**Final Answer**: B
