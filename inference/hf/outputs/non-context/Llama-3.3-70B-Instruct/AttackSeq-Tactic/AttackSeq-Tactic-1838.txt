To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the situation based on the information provided and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that CTU analysts sinkholed 'Tawnya Grilth' domains and redirected infected traffic to servers for logging connections and gathering statistics. Sinkholing is a technique used to redirect traffic from a malicious domain to a controlled server to understand and analyze the behavior of malware or an attacker's infrastructure. This action is typically taken after the initial compromise has occurred, and the goal is to gather more information about the attack.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The action described involves taking control of domains used by attackers (sinkholing) and analyzing the traffic to understand the attackers' behavior. This implies that the attackers had already established command and control (C2) communications with compromised hosts. The sinkholing and analysis of traffic would be part of understanding and potentially disrupting the attackers' command and control channels.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Impact**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions to manipulate, disrupt, or destroy data or systems. While impact could be a goal of the attackers, the action described (sinkholing and analyzing traffic) is more about understanding and potentially disrupting the attackers' activities rather than causing impact directly.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. The scenario described doesn't directly relate to the execution phase, as it focuses on analyzing traffic after the initial compromise.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining communication between compromised systems and the attackers' C2 servers. The action of sinkholing domains and analyzing traffic directly relates to understanding and disrupting this communication, suggesting that command and control communications were already established.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker's efforts to gather information about the target environment. While discovery is crucial for attackers, the scenario described is more about the defenders' actions to understand the attackers' infrastructure and behavior, not the attackers' discovery phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The defenders' action of sinkholing domains and analyzing traffic indicates they are responding to an established threat, specifically focusing on the communication channels used by the attackers.
   - This action is most closely related to understanding and disrupting the **Command and Control** channels, as it directly impacts the attackers' ability to control compromised systems.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described action is related to the defenders' efforts to analyze and disrupt the attackers' command and control capabilities.

Final Answer: C
