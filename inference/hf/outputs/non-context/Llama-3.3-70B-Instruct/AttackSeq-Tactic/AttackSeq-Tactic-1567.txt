To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Konni APT leveraged obfuscated scripts for evidence deletion and before using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the use of obfuscated scripts ('versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs') for managing the deletion of evidence. This action is associated with hiding or evading detection, which falls under the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this action and before the discovery of system details using 'versioninfo.bat'.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The initial action is the use of obfuscated scripts for defense evasion (deleting evidence).
   - The subsequent action (the one we are trying to identify) should logically precede the discovery of system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While it's a possible action in an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the preparation for discovering system details.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or environment. Using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details fits well within this category. However, the question asks for the tactic before this discovery, not the discovery itself.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: The initial action described (using obfuscated scripts to delete evidence) is a form of defense evasion. However, the question asks for the tactic after this action, implying we are looking for something that follows defense evasion in the attack sequence.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic involves actions that affect the system, data, or network, such as data manipulation or disruption. While it's a possible later stage in an attack, it doesn't directly fit as a precursor to system discovery in a logical attack sequence.

Given the context, the most logical sequence suggests that after evading defenses (by deleting evidence), the next step would involve preparing for or facilitating further actions within the network, which could include setting the stage for discovery. However, the provided options and the specific question context suggest looking for an action that precedes system discovery but follows defense evasion.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial action is defense evasion (using obfuscated scripts to delete evidence).
2. The question asks for the tactic after this evasion and before system discovery.
3. Considering typical attack sequences, after evading defenses, an attacker might engage in actions that facilitate further movement or preparation for exploitation, but the options given don't perfectly align with typical sequences in a straightforward manner.
4. Given the choices, **B: Discovery** is the action that involves gathering information and would logically follow initial defense evasion tactics in an attack sequence aimed at understanding the target environment before further exploitation. However, the question's phrasing suggests looking for an action before discovery, which might imply an action that enables or sets up the discovery phase.

**Final Answer**: Given the constraints and focusing on the logical sequence of actions in an attack, the most fitting answer based on typical attack sequences and the information provided would be **B: Discovery**, as it directly precedes the action described ('using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details') in a logical attack sequence, even though the question's wording suggests looking for a preceding action. However, considering standard attack sequences and the provided options, **B: Discovery** seems to be the closest fit in the context of preparing for or engaging in system discovery activities after initial defense evasion tactics. 

**Final Answer: B**
