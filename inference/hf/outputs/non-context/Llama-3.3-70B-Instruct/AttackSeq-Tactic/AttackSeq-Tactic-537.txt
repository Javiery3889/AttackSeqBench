To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the creation of a Windows service for persistence and the use of a dropper to deploy a backdoor. The sequence of events seems to involve an attacker gaining access to a system, using a dropper to install malware (in this case, the 'NewPass' backdoor), and then ensuring persistence through the creation of a Windows service.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The use of a dropper to deploy malware is typically associated with the "Execution" tactic, as it involves executing malicious code on the target system.
   - The creation of a Windows service for persistence is directly related to the "Persistence" tactic, as it allows the malware to survive system restarts.
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely preceded the use of a dropper, which means we are looking for an action that would logically come before executing the dropper.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This is the tactic used after the dropper has been executed, as indicated by the creation of a Windows service. It doesn't precede the dropper's execution.
   - **B: Execution**: This is the tactic directly associated with the use of a dropper to deploy malware. However, the question asks for the tactic that precedes this action.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. It could logically precede the execution of a dropper, as an attacker would likely want to understand the system before deciding how to deploy malware.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target system or network. While important, it doesn't directly precede the deployment of a dropper in a logical sequence aimed at establishing a foothold.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of a dropper to deploy malware like the 'NewPass' backdoor is a method of executing malicious code on a target system.
   - Before executing such code, an attacker would likely want to understand the system's configuration, defenses, and potential vulnerabilities to choose the right moment and method for deployment.
   - The creation of a Windows service for persistence is a step taken after the malware is deployed to ensure it remains on the system.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the logical sequence of actions in an attack, the tactic that most likely precedes the use of a dropper (Execution) would be **Discovery**, as it involves gathering information necessary for planning the deployment of malware.

Final Answer: C
