To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after maintaining persistence and before collecting detailed information about the victim's machine, let's analyze the sequence of events and the tactics involved.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence where an attacker, identified as Tortoiseshell, uses a Remote Access Tool (RAT) named 'IvizTech' to maintain persistence on a victim's system. After establishing persistence, the attacker uses a reconnaissance tool named 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's machine.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The initial step involves maintaining persistence, which is a tactic to keep access to the system.
   - The next step mentioned is the use of 'bird.exe' for reconnaissance, which falls under the Discovery tactic as it involves gathering information about the system and its environment.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems or services. While it's a possible step in an attack, it doesn't directly follow from maintaining persistence and precede system reconnaissance in a logical sequence of attack tactics.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, its configuration, and the environment. Given that 'bird.exe' is used for reconnaissance, this tactic aligns well with the action of collecting detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **C: Impact**: This tactic is about disrupting or destroying systems and data. It doesn't fit the sequence as it's more about causing harm rather than gathering information.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion is a critical aspect of maintaining access and executing attacks without detection, the specific action of using 'bird.exe' for reconnaissance doesn't directly imply evasion techniques as its primary goal.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained access and is maintaining persistence.
   - The next logical step before or while using 'bird.exe' for detailed reconnaissance would be to ensure the attacker can move freely within the system without detection, but the question specifically asks for the tactic before the reconnaissance tool is used.
   - Given the context, the most direct and relevant tactic that would occur after establishing persistence and before using a reconnaissance tool is not explicitly listed in a way that perfectly matches the typical sequence (e.g., Defense Evasion could be seen as a continuous effort, and Credential Access might be part of the initial compromise or post-persistence actions).
   - However, considering the direct action described (using 'bird.exe' for reconnaissance), the closest and most relevant tactic from the provided options that aligns with the sequence of events described (especially focusing on the action of gathering information) would indeed be related to **Discovery**, as it directly involves gathering information about the system and its environment.

**Final Answer: B**
