To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the Higaisa APT group used a JavaScript file to execute 'cmd /c ipconfig' to retrieve IP address information, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Action**: The action described involves executing a command to retrieve IP address information using 'cmd /c ipconfig'. This action is aimed at gathering information about the network or system the attackers have access to.

2. **Identifying the TTPs**: The use of a JavaScript file to execute system commands indicates an attempt to interact with the system, potentially for reconnaissance or to prepare for further malicious activities.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security controls. While defense evasion is a common tactic used throughout an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the goal of gathering IP address information.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic is about the attacker's actions to manipulate, disrupt, or destroy data or systems. Retrieving IP address information doesn't directly align with causing impact but is more about gathering information.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations, which might include gathering information about the environment. However, it's more focused on the development and maintenance of resources rather than the initial information gathering.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or organization. The action of executing 'cmd /c ipconfig' to retrieve IP address information fits well within the discovery phase, as it's aimed at understanding the environment.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the action described is aimed at gathering system and network information, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before this action would be part of the **Discovery** phase. This is because the attackers are trying to understand the environment they are operating in, which is a crucial step before deciding on further actions, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, moving laterally, or exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: D
