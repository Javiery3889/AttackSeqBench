To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a victim is enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider, which eventually leads to the execution of the EVILNUM malware. The key elements here are the enticement of the victim to follow a link and the hosting of the file on a cloud provider.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in this scenario starts with the victim being tricked into accessing a malicious file. This action is a precursor to the malware's execution and is aimed at gaining access to the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gain knowledge about the system, network, or organization. While discovery is a crucial part of the attack lifecycle, it doesn't directly relate to the initial act of enticing a victim to follow a link.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic refers to the adversary executing malicious code on the victim's system. While execution is part of the scenario, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the malware execution, focusing on how the victim was initially compromised.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining an initial foothold within the network. Enticing a victim to follow a link to a malicious file hosted on a cloud provider is a common method for achieving initial access, as it can lead to the execution of malware or the installation of a backdoor.
   - **D: Persistence**: This tactic is about the adversary maintaining their presence within the system. Persistence occurs after initial access has been achieved and is not directly related to the initial act of enticing a victim to follow a malicious link.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the action taken before the malware execution, specifically how the victim was tricked into accessing the malicious file.
   - The tactic of enticing a victim to follow a link to a malicious file aligns with gaining initial access to the victim's system.
   - Initial Access (C) is the most appropriate tactic because it directly relates to the methods used by adversaries to initially gain access to a system, such as phishing or driving-by compromises, which can involve tricking victims into following links to malicious files.

**Final Answer: C**
