To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor establishing communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers.
   - It specifies the use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for this communication.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic most likely to occur for transferring the collected data after this communication is established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - The initial step involves establishing communication with C2 servers, which is part of the "Command and Control" tactic.
   - The question then asks about transferring collected data, which implies a subsequent action after the establishment of C2.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves creating, purchasing, or compromising resources that can be used to support operations. While resource development is crucial for an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the transfer of collected data.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic has already been achieved as per the question stem (establishing communication with C2 servers). It's about maintaining control over compromised systems, not specifically about data transfer.
   - **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves transferring data from a compromised system to an external system or location. Given that the backdoor has established communication and presumably collected data, exfiltration is the most logical next step for transferring this data.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within an internal network. While important for expanding access within a network, it doesn't directly pertain to transferring collected data out of the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines the establishment of communication for C2 purposes.
   - The next logical step after collecting data (implied by the establishment of a backdoor and C2 communication) is to transfer this data.
   - Exfiltration is the tactic directly related to transferring data from a compromised system to an external location.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after establishing C2 communication for the purpose of transferring collected data is exfiltration.

Final Answer: C
