To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where a batch file is executed, leading to the installation of a main payload. Following this, the malware attempts to gain elevated privileges by bypassing User Access Control (UAC).
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves the execution of a batch file (which would fall under "Execution") and then an action to bypass UAC for privilege escalation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system or network. While discovery might occur at various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the action of bypassing UAC for privilege escalation.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic is about executing malicious code, which aligns with the initial part of the scenario (installing the main payload via a batch file). However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this execution and involved bypassing UAC.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic is related to the adversary establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control servers or creating new accounts. It doesn't directly relate to the immediate post-execution actions described.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic directly involves the adversary attempting to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network, which aligns with the action of bypassing UAC to gain elevated privileges.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial action described is the execution of a batch file, which leads to the installation of the main payload. This is an execution tactic.
   - The question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after this execution and involved bypassing UAC for elevated privileges.
   - Bypassing UAC to gain elevated privileges directly corresponds to the definition of privilege escalation.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after executing the batch file and installing the main payload, given the goal of gaining elevated privileges by bypassing UAC, is **Privilege Escalation**.

Final Answer: D
