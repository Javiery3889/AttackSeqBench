To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions a malicious Word document that creates persistence through a batch file and a registry entry. It also mentions the use of Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute PowerShell commands. The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves:
   - The use of a malicious Word document, which suggests an initial entry point.
   - The exploitation of Microsoft Office DDE to execute PowerShell commands, indicating a method of executing code on the victim's system.
   - The creation of persistence through a batch file and a registry entry, which is a method to maintain access to the system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold on a system. The use of a malicious Word document to exploit DDE for executing PowerShell commands fits well within this category, as it describes a method by which an attacker could initially gain access to a system.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves executing code on a system. While the use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands does indeed involve execution, the context provided (a malicious Word document leading to persistence) suggests that execution is a step in a broader process that starts with gaining initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement (A)** and **Impact (C)**: These tactics involve moving laterally within a network and causing an effect on a system or network, respectively. The information provided does not directly suggest movement within a network or causing an impact as the primary goal of using DDE in this context.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malicious Word document is likely the initial vector of attack.
   - The exploitation of DDE to execute PowerShell commands is a technique used to gain execution on the system, which is a step that follows initial access.
   - Given the context, the most relevant ATT&CK tactic that involves the use of Microsoft Office DDE to execute PowerShell commands, as part of a sequence that includes creating persistence, would be related to how the attack initially gains access to the system.
   
Final Answer: D
