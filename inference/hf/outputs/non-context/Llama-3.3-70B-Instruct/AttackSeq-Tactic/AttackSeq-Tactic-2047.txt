To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Iron Tiger's rshell backdoor collected OS information and transmitted it to their C&C server while continuing to receive and execute commands, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The fact that Iron Tiger's rshell backdoor is already installed and operational on the victim's system indicates that the initial access and execution phases have been completed. The backdoor's ability to collect OS information and transmit it to the C&C server shows that it is communicating effectively with its command and control infrastructure.

2. **Collection of OS Information**: The collection of OS information is part of the **Discovery** tactic (Tactic ID: TA0007). This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or organization. However, since the question asks for the tactic that occurred **after** this collection, we need to consider what typically follows the discovery phase in an attack sequence.

3. **Receiving and Executing Commands**: The backdoor's capability to receive and execute commands from the C&C server is a key aspect of the **Command and Control** (Tactic ID: TA0011) tactic. This tactic is about maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attackers, allowing them to issue commands and receive data. However, the question implies we are looking for a tactic that follows the establishment of this command and control channel and the initial discovery activities.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion techniques are used throughout an attack to avoid detection, they are not necessarily the next logical step after establishing command and control and initial discovery. Defense evasion can occur at any point during the attack lifecycle.

- **B: Lateral Movement**: After establishing a foothold and gathering initial information, attackers often attempt to **move laterally** within the network to expand their access, escalate privileges, and achieve their objectives. Lateral movement (Tactic ID: TA0008) is a plausible next step after the initial discovery and establishment of command and control, as it aligns with the attackers' goal of further compromising the network.

- **C: Discovery**: Since the question states that the backdoor has already collected OS information, additional discovery activities might continue, but the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** this initial discovery.

- **D: Command and Control**: This is already happening, as indicated by the backdoor receiving and executing commands. The question seeks the next tactic in the sequence.

Based on the analysis, the most likely next step after collecting OS information and establishing command and control would be to **move laterally** within the network to further the attack's objectives.

Final Answer: B
