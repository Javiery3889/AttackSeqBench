To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that after capturing system data and stealing information (which is part of the Collection phase), the attacker needs to send the encrypted stolen data traffic over a specified port to a Command and Control (C2) server. The Collection phase is already mentioned as having occurred, so we're looking for the next step in the attack sequence that involves communicating with a C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The question explicitly mentions the Collection phase (TTPs related to gathering information) and implies the need for a subsequent phase that involves sending stolen data to a C2 server. This action of sending data to a C2 server is characteristic of establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Collection**: This is the phase that has already occurred, according to the question. It involves gathering information, which doesn't match the action of sending data to a C2 server.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining an initial foothold on the system, which is not relevant to sending stolen data to a C2 server after collection has occurred.
   - **C: Impact**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate systems and data, which might include data exfiltration but is broader and not specifically focused on the communication aspect with a C2 server.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic directly involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server, which is necessary for sending stolen data back to the attacker.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes an action (sending encrypted stolen data to a C2 server) that follows the Collection phase.
   - The Collection phase has already occurred, so we're looking for the next logical step in the attack sequence.
   - The action of sending data to a C2 server is most closely related to maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for this action is Command and Control, as it directly involves communication with a C2 server.

Final Answer: D
