To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where KiraV2, presumably a type of malware, is spreading to other IoT devices after exploiting vulnerabilities in devices like MVPower DVR and Huawei routers. The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to these devices.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key action here is the exploitation of vulnerabilities in IoT devices. This action is a precursor to the malware spreading and executing DDoS attacks. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when this exploitation happened.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. While execution is a part of the overall attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system or network. It doesn't directly relate to exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
   - **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. Exploiting vulnerabilities in devices to spread malware aligns with gaining initial access to those devices.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network after gaining initial access. While the malware does spread, the question focuses on the initial exploitation of IoT devices, not movement within a network after access has been gained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about the exploitation of vulnerabilities in IoT devices as a means to distribute malware.
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to a system or device is a method of achieving initial access.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic related to this action is **Initial Access**.

Final Answer: C
