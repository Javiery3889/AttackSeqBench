To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described sequence of events, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: The attack starts with the exploitation of CVE-2017-12824 using a malicious INP file. This action is aimed at gaining initial access to the victim's system. The use of an exploit to gain access aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic.

2. **Execution of the First Binary File**: After gaining access, the first binary file is executed. This execution is a result of the initial access and is aimed at further establishing a foothold on the system. The execution of malicious files or code is part of the **Execution** tactic.

3. **Extraction of Another File and Creation of a Thread for a Subsequent Executable**: The first binary extracts another file to the temp folder and creates a thread for a subsequent executable. This action indicates an attempt to maintain or expand the attacker's control over the system. Extracting files and creating threads for subsequent executables can be part of establishing **Persistence** or facilitating **Execution**, but given the context, it leans more towards setting up for continued **Execution** and potentially **Persistence**.

Given these steps, the question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after these events. Let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Initial Access**: This has already occurred with the exploitation of CVE-2017-12824.
- **B: Command and Control**: While establishing command and control is a crucial step in an attack, the described actions focus more on the initial stages of compromise and setting up for further malicious activity rather than explicitly establishing command and control channels.
- **C: Persistence**: The actions described, such as extracting another file and creating a thread for a subsequent executable, could be part of attempting to maintain access to the system, which aligns with persistence tactics.
- **D: Execution**: The execution of the first binary and the setup for a subsequent executable directly align with the **Execution** tactic, which involves executing malicious code to achieve the attacker's goals.

Considering the sequence of events and the focus on executing malicious code and setting up for further execution, the most directly related tactic after the initial access and exploitation would be **Execution**, as it involves running the adversary's code to achieve their objectives, which includes the extraction and setup for subsequent executables.

Final Answer: D
