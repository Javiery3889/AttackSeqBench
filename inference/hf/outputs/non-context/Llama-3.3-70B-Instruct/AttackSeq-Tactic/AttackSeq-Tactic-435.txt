To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where an obfuscated VBScript named 'PlayList.vbs' is executed using 'wscript.exe'. 
   - After execution and before communicating with a Command and Control (C2) server, the script is deleted.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to delete the VBS script and evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves techniques that an adversary uses to maintain their presence on a compromised system. Deleting a script to evade detection doesn't directly relate to maintaining access or presence.
   - **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic includes techniques that adversaries use to evade detection and bypass security mechanisms. Deleting the VBS script after execution to avoid detection fits well within this category, as it aims to hide the adversary's tracks.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. The scenario described doesn't mention movement between systems, so this doesn't fit.
   - **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials that can be used to access systems, data, or services. The described action of deleting a script doesn't directly relate to obtaining credentials.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the deletion of the VBS script after execution and before communicating with the C2 server, with the goal of evading detection.
   - Deleting the script is a method to avoid leaving traces of the attack, which aligns with evading security mechanisms.
   - Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the tactic that involves evading detection and bypassing security controls is **Defense Evasion**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in this scenario involves **Defense Evasion** to delete the script and avoid detection.

Final Answer: B
