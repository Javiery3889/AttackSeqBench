To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions an attack sequence that involves employing camouflaged malicious apps on Google Play and achieving execution through a specific app named "callCam." It asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred as the first step in this sequence.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the use of "camouflaged malicious apps" and the achievement of "execution" through a specific app. This implies that the attackers first needed to gain access to the victim's device or system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Exfiltration** refers to the act of transferring data from a system without authorization. This is unlikely to be the first step since exfiltration typically occurs after initial access and potentially after execution of malicious code to gather data.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** involves moving from one system to another within an internal network. This also seems unlikely as the first step since lateral movement typically occurs after initial access has been gained.
   - **C: Execution** refers to the process of running malicious code on a system. While execution is mentioned in the question, it is described as something that happened "through the callCam app," suggesting it is a step after the initial access.
   - **D: Initial Access** involves gaining an initial foothold within a system or network. Given that the attackers employed camouflaged malicious apps, this tactic aligns with the first step in the attack sequence, as it would allow the attackers to initially compromise the victim's device.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first need to get their malicious app onto the victim's device.
   - The use of "camouflaged malicious apps on Google Play" suggests a method to achieve initial access by disguising malware as legitimate apps.
   - After the app is installed (initial access), the attackers can then achieve execution of their malicious code through the app.
   - Therefore, the most logical first step in this sequence is gaining initial access to the device.

**Final Answer: D**
