To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving malware (ATMitch) that interacts with an ATM. The key points are:
   - The malware reads commands from a file.
   - It logs actions into a local directory.
   - It dispenses cash by interacting with ATM components using the 'msxfs.dll' library.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The actions described indicate a level of control and interaction with the ATM's system to perform a specific action (dispensing cash). The use of 'msxfs.dll' suggests a direct interaction with the ATM's hardware or software components to execute this action.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems or devices. While reading commands from a file could be part of command and control, the primary focus of the question is on the action taken (dispensing cash) rather than how the malware receives instructions.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic involves the outcomes or effects of the attacker's actions, such as data manipulation, disruption of service, or financial impact. Dispensing cash directly impacts the financial aspect of the ATM, suggesting a tangible outcome of the attack.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. The scenario does not specifically mention obtaining or using credentials to dispense cash.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system or network. The actions described (reading commands, logging actions, dispensing cash) imply that access has already been gained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware's ability to interact with ATM components and dispense cash indicates it has already gained access to the system.
   - The action of dispensing cash is a direct outcome of the malware's interaction with the ATM, suggesting an impact on the system or its function.
   - The focus on the outcome (dispensing cash) rather than the method of control or initial entry suggests the tactic is more aligned with causing an effect rather than gaining access or controlling the system.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most likely ATT&CK tactic when the malware dispensed cash by interacting with ATM components is related to the outcome or effect of the attack, which is financial in nature.

Final Answer: B
