To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker. The sequence starts with gaining initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) and ends with the collection of system information using POWERSHOWER. We need to identify the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The initial action is exploiting a vulnerability for initial access.
   - The final action mentioned is collecting system information using POWERSHOWER.
   - We are looking for the tactic that likely occurred between these two actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This is the first step mentioned in the question, so it's already occurred and not what we're looking for.
   - **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker learning more about the system or network they've gained access to. Collecting system information is a key part of the Discovery tactic. Given that the attacker is using POWERSHOWER to collect system information, it suggests they are in the process of discovering more about the infected machines.
   - **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control infrastructure. While important, it doesn't directly relate to the action of collecting system information.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker taking actions to avoid being detected. While defense evasion techniques might be used during the collection of system information, the primary goal of collecting system information aligns more closely with the Discovery tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained initial access.
   - The next logical step for the attacker would be to gather more information about the system or network to plan further actions.
   - Collecting system information using POWERSHOWER directly aligns with the goals of the Discovery tactic.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the sequence of actions described, the most likely ATT&CK tactic to have occurred before collecting system information is the Discovery tactic, as it directly relates to the action of gathering more information about the infected machines.

Final Answer: B
