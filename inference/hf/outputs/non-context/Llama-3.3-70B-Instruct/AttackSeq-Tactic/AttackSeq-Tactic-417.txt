To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors have already moved laterally within a network using credentials obtained via Mimikatz. This indicates they have gained access to the network and are now expanding their control.
   - The key actions mentioned are the lateral movement and the execution of commands on other systems, followed by maintaining interaction with a compromised server and executing further commands.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The use of Mimikatz for credential theft and lateral movement suggests the tactic of **Credential Access** and **Lateral Movement** have already occurred.
   - The execution of commands on other systems and maintaining interaction with a compromised server for further command execution points towards an ongoing communication and control mechanism.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up a command and control (C2) server or creating a backdoor. While related, the question focuses more on the interaction and command execution rather than setting up new resources.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This has already been achieved as per the question, using credentials obtained via Mimikatz. The question asks for the next likely tactic after lateral movement has occurred.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic is about gaining an initial foothold into the network, which has already been accomplished according to the scenario described.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems to execute commands. Given that the threat actors are maintaining interaction with a compromised server and executing further commands, this aligns closely with the description of Command and Control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actors have already gained access and moved laterally, indicating that **Initial Access** and **Lateral Movement** tactics have been completed.
   - The focus on maintaining interaction with a compromised server and executing further commands suggests an ongoing need to control and communicate with the compromised systems.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic that aligns with the scenario described is **Command and Control**, as it directly relates to the maintenance of communication and the ability to execute commands on compromised systems.

Final Answer: D
