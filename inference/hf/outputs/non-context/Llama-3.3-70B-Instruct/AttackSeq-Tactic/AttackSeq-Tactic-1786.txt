To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Elise malware moved its payload to the `\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\` directory and executed the DLL by injecting it into Internet Explorer (`iexplore.exe`), let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Situation**: The malware has already gained access to the system, moved its payload to a specific directory, and executed it by injecting a DLL into a running process (`iexplore.exe`). This action indicates that the malware is attempting to establish a foothold on the system and possibly evade detection.

2. **Understanding ATT&CK Tactics**:
   - **Discovery (A)**: Involves gathering information about the system, network, or environment. While discovery is a crucial phase in the attack lifecycle, the actions described (moving a payload and executing a DLL) don't directly align with typical discovery activities.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: Refers to the communication between the malware and its command and control server. Establishing C2 is essential for the attacker to issue commands and receive stolen data. Injecting a DLL into a process like `iexplore.exe` could be a method to establish persistence and potentially communicate with a C2 server, but it's more directly related to maintaining access.
   - **Persistence (C)**: Involves techniques that an adversary uses to maintain their presence on a system. By moving its payload to a directory like `\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\` and executing it, the malware is attempting to survive system restarts and maintain its access to the system. Injecting into a common process like `iexplore.exe` further supports this, as it allows the malware to run under the guise of a legitimate process.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: Techniques used to evade detection. While injecting a DLL into a legitimate process can be a form of defense evasion, the primary goal in this scenario seems more aligned with establishing a persistent presence rather than solely evading defenses.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Given the actions described, the most plausible next step after executing the malware and injecting it into `iexplore.exe` would be to ensure that the malware can persist on the system. This would allow the attacker to maintain access over time, potentially for further exploitation, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the tactic that most likely occurred after the described actions is **Persistence**. This is because the actions taken by the malware (moving its payload to a specific directory and executing it by injecting into a legitimate process) are typical of techniques used to maintain access to a compromised system.

Final Answer: C
