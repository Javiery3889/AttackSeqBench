To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after UNC1945 collected credentials and before moving laterally through networks, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: 
   - The question mentions the use of the SLAPSTICK backdoor and Mimikatz for lateral movement, indicating that the attackers have already gained access to the network and are in the process of expanding their control.
   - The use of these tools suggests that the attackers are focused on credential collection and lateral movement, which are key components of the "Credential Access" and "Lateral Movement" tactics, respectively.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after credential collection but before further lateral movement using different tools (ProxyChains and IMPACKET).

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The sequence starts with credential collection (using SLAPSTICK and Mimikatz).
   - The question implies that after collecting credentials, the attackers would likely use the obtained credentials for further actions within the network.
   - Before moving laterally through the network using additional tools, the attackers would likely engage in activities that help them understand the network layout, identify potential targets, or prepare for the next stages of the attack.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Impact**: This tactic involves causing direct effects on the network or systems, such as data destruction or disruption of services. While possible, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of collecting credentials and then moving laterally.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations, which could include setting up command and control channels or creating backdoors. This could potentially occur after credential collection as part of preparing for further operations.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic has already been accomplished, as indicated by the use of SLAPSTICK and Mimikatz for credential collection.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, systems, or applications. After collecting credentials and before further lateral movement, discovering more about the network (e.g., network topology, active directories) would be a logical step to plan the next moves effectively.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already collected credentials, indicating they are past the initial "Credential Access" phase.
   - The next logical step before moving laterally and using additional tools would be to gather more information about the network to facilitate effective lateral movement and to identify high-value targets.
   - "Discovery" aligns with this need for information gathering and network reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D**
