To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after ScarCruft established initial access and before employing DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion, let's analyze the sequence of events described:

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers, ScarCruft, gained initial access through phishing emails containing malicious Office documents. This step corresponds to the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gaining an initial foothold within a network.

2. **Next Tactic**: After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely need to execute their malicious code or payload to establish a presence within the network. This is where the "Execution" tactic comes into play. Execution involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which could be necessary for setting up further malicious activities, including defense evasion techniques.

3. **Defense Evasion**: The use of DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion indicates an attempt to hide or obscure the malicious activity from security controls. This tactic is employed after the attackers have code executing on the system that they want to protect from being detected.

Given this sequence:
- **Initial Access** has already occurred through phishing.
- **Defense Evasion** is mentioned as a later step, involving DLL Side-Loading.

The missing link in the sequence provided is the **Execution** of the malicious code, which would logically occur after initial access is gained and before attempting to evade defenses. Execution is necessary for running the malicious code that the attackers delivered through the phishing emails, setting the stage for further tactics like defense evasion.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access method: Phishing emails with malicious Office documents.
2. Determine the next logical step after initial access: Execution of the malicious payload.
3. Recognize the defense evasion technique (DLL Side-Loading) as a subsequent step to hide the malicious activity.

**Final Answer: B**
