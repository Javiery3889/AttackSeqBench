To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros within malicious Word documents are executed. This is followed by scripts from watering hole attacks communicating with external servers. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred during this communication phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - The initial step involves the execution of VBA macros, which is a technique often used for gaining access or executing malicious code on a victim's system.
   - The subsequent step involves communication with external servers, which typically occurs after the initial compromise to establish command and control (C2) channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a victim's system. While the execution of VBA macros falls under this category, the communication with external servers suggests a step beyond mere execution.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic refers to the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or manipulate systems and data. The communication with external servers doesn't directly imply an impact tactic without further context on what the communication achieves.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the adversary's command and control server. This allows the adversary to issue commands and receive stolen data. The scenario of scripts communicating with external servers fits well within this tactic.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial entry point used by an adversary to gain access to a network. While the execution of VBA macros could be an initial access technique, the communication with external servers indicates a post-compromise activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The execution of VBA macros is an initial step that could lead to various tactics, including execution and potentially initial access if it's the first point of entry.
   - However, the key detail is the communication with external servers, which is a strong indicator of establishing or maintaining command and control.
   - This communication is not merely about executing code (Execution) or causing an impact (Impact) but about maintaining a connection for potentially issuing commands or exfiltrating data.
   - Initial Access (D) is less likely because the question implies that access has already been gained (through the execution of macros), and now the focus is on what happens after that initial access.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that after gaining initial access and executing malicious code, the communication with external servers is primarily for command and control purposes.

Final Answer: C
