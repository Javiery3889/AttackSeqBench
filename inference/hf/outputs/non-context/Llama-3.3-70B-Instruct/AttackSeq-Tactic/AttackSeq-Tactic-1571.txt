To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions a tool or script named 'versioninfo.bat' that collects and prepares various information from the user's computer for sending to its destination. This implies that the script is gathering data, possibly for malicious purposes, and is ready to send it outside the victim's network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The action described involves collecting information, which aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as it involves gathering information about the system or network. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely follows this action, given that the information is being prepared for sending.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to maintain their presence within a system or network over time. While important for long-term access, it doesn't directly relate to the act of sending collected information.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the techniques attackers use to transfer data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system. Given that 'versioninfo.bat' has collected and prepared information for sending, this seems like a direct next step.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control (C2) system. While C2 is crucial for receiving further instructions, the specific action of sending collected data aligns more closely with exfiltration.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or application. Since the question states that the information has already been collected and prepared for sending, the next logical step would not be further discovery but rather the action of sending the data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The 'versioninfo.bat' script collects information, which is a discovery activity.
   - The information is prepared for sending, indicating the next step is to transfer this data outside the network.
   - Exfiltration is the tactic that directly involves transferring data from a compromised system to an external system, making it the most likely next step after data collection and preparation.

Final Answer: B
