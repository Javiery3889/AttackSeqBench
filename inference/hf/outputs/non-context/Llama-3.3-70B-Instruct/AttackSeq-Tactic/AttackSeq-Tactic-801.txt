To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the exploitation of an Exchange Server via ProxyLogon zero-days and before the use of 'living off the land' techniques with bitsadmin.exe to download Aro.dat, let's break down the sequence of events described:

1. **Exploitation of Exchange Server via ProxyLogon zero-days**: This step involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the Exchange Server to gain initial access to the system. This action aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic, as it involves gaining an entry point into the network.

2. **Uploading a webshell for privileged code execution**: After gaining access, the attackers upload a webshell, which allows them to execute commands on the compromised server with elevated privileges. This action is part of the **Execution** tactic, as it involves executing malicious code on the compromised system to achieve further control.

3. **Using 'living off the land' techniques with bitsadmin.exe to download Aro.dat**: This step involves using existing system tools (in this case, bitsadmin.exe) to download additional malicious files (Aro.dat), which is a technique to maintain access and execute further malicious activities without introducing new, potentially detectable tools. This action can be associated with **Execution** or **Persistence**, but given the context, it's more about executing the next stage of the attack.

Given these steps, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial exploitation and before the 'living off the land' technique was used. The sequence provided starts with **Initial Access** (exploiting the Exchange Server), followed by **Execution** (uploading a webshell for privileged code execution). The use of bitsadmin.exe for downloading Aro.dat also falls under **Execution**, as it involves executing commands to further the attack.

Considering the options provided:
- **A: Initial Access** has already occurred with the exploitation of the Exchange Server.
- **B: Reconnaissance** might happen at various stages but isn't directly implied between the exploitation and the use of bitsadmin.exe.
- **C: Execution** is the most fitting, as the uploading of a webshell and the subsequent use of bitsadmin.exe both involve executing malicious code or commands on the system.
- **D: Exfiltration** involves stealing data, which isn't directly mentioned in the sequence provided.

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial exploitation and before the 'living off the land' technique was used is **Execution**, as it encompasses the actions of uploading a webshell and using system tools to download additional malicious components.

Final Answer: C
