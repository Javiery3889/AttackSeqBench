To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the SLUB backdoor, including downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet from GitHub for executable commands, retrieving the username and computer name, and eventually exfiltrating data through uploading files to file.io and posting download links to a Slack channel. The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves initial discovery, command and control, and finally, data exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target environment. The actions of retrieving the username and computer name fit into this category. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before exfiltration, not the initial steps of the attack.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic is about establishing a means for the attacker to issue commands to the compromised system. Downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet for executable commands aligns with this tactic, as it involves the attacker controlling the compromised system remotely.
   - **Exfiltration (B)**: This is the tactic of removing data from the target system. The question mentions this as the final step (exfiltrating data through uploading files to file.io and posting download links to a Slack channel), so it cannot be what occurred before itself.
   - **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining resources (like infrastructure or capabilities) that can be used for future operations. While important, the specific actions described in the question do not directly point to resource development as the immediate precursor to exfiltration.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The SLUB backdoor's actions start with **Discovery (C)**, where it gathers information about the system (retrieving username and computer name).
   - The backdoor then engages in **Command and Control (D)** by downloading and parsing commands, indicating the attacker is now controlling the system.
   - Before the final step of **Exfiltration (B)**, the attacker must have a means to control the system to execute the exfiltration commands, which aligns with **Command and Control (D)**.
   - **Resource Development (A)** doesn't directly fit the sequence described as it's more about preparing for future attacks rather than the immediate actions leading to exfiltration.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the exfiltration of data is the establishment of **Command and Control (D)**, as this would enable the attacker to issue the commands necessary for exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: D**
