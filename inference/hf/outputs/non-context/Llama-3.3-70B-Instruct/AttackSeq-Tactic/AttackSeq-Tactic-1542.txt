To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses spear phishing emails with embedded exploits within RTF (Rich Text Format) files to gain initial access to victims' computers. After gaining access, the attacker leverages the cloud-based WebDAV protocol for command and control via CloudMe.com.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - The first step involves using spear phishing emails with exploits in RTF files. This is a method to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - The second step involves using the WebDAV protocol for command and control, which is a method of maintaining communication with the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. Techniques under this tactic include spear phishing, which aligns with the use of spear phishing emails with embedded exploits to gain access to victims' computers.
   - **Persistence (B)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system or network. While important, it doesn't directly relate to the initial method of gaining access described.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems. The use of WebDAV for command and control falls under this category, but the question asks for the tactic involved before this step.
   - **Privilege Escalation (D)**: This tactic is about gaining higher privileges on a system than initially granted. The scenario described doesn't directly imply privilege escalation as the primary goal of the initial step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically asks for the ATT&CK tactic most likely involved in the initial step of embedding exploits within RTF files to gain a foothold.
   - The initial step of using spear phishing with exploits in RTF files to gain access to victims' computers aligns with techniques under the **Initial Access** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gaining **Initial Access** to the system before moving on to other tactics like **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: A**
