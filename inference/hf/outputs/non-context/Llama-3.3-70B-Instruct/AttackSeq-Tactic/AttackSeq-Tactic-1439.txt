To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the options step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of impersonated login pages to collect credentials from targeted personnel. This action is followed by a redirection to a YouTube clip via a suspicious link. The key elements here are the collection of credentials and the subsequent redirection.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The collection of credentials typically falls under the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, we are looking for the tactic that most likely occurred before the redirection to a YouTube clip, which implies we are looking for an action that precedes the credential collection in the attack sequence.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems or exfiltrating data. It doesn't directly relate to the initial stages of an attack like collecting credentials or redirecting to a suspicious link.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It is a preliminary step that could involve sending suspicious links to gather information about the target's network or to test their security controls before attempting to collect credentials.
   - **C: Credential Access**: While this is directly related to collecting credentials, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the redirection, which is likely part of the credential collection process itself.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gain knowledge about the system and its environment. While important, it typically follows initial access and doesn't directly relate to the act of collecting credentials via impersonated login pages or the redirection to a YouTube clip.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of impersonated login pages to collect credentials suggests an active attempt to gain access.
   - The redirection to a YouTube clip via a suspicious link could be part of a phishing campaign aimed at gaining initial access or as a distraction.
   - Before attempting to collect credentials, an attacker would likely engage in **Reconnaissance** to understand the target environment, identify vulnerabilities, and tailor their phishing campaign for maximum effectiveness.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the redirection and the attempt to collect credentials is **Reconnaissance**. This is because understanding the target and their environment would be crucial before launching a targeted phishing campaign that includes impersonated login pages and suspicious links.

Final Answer: B
