To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies, but before they intercepted HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics:

1. **Initial Action**: Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies. This action suggests they have already gained access to the system or the web application in question. The manipulation of session keys and cookies indicates an attempt to maintain or escalate their access.

2. **Objective**: The ultimate goal here, as indicated, is to intercept HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials. This action is aimed at collecting sensitive information.

3. **Tactics Analysis**:
   - **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques that an adversary uses to evade detection and bypass security controls. While manipulating session keys and cookies could be part of defense evasion, the primary goal of stealing login credentials suggests a focus on collecting data rather than solely evading defenses.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic is about the adversary's initial entry point into the network or system. Given that Earth Wendigo has already executed malicious scripts, initial access has likely been achieved prior to this point.
   - **Persistence (C)**: Persistence involves techniques that an adversary uses to maintain their presence within a network or system over time. Manipulating session keys and cookies could be a form of persistence, as it allows the adversary to maintain access without needing to re-enter the system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before intercepting HTTPS POST requests, which is more directly related to collecting data.
   - **Collection (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used for future operations or to satisfy the adversary's intelligence requirements. Intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials directly falls under collection. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this collection, considering the manipulation of session keys and cookies as a preceding action.

Given the sequence of events:
- Earth Wendigo has already gained access and is manipulating the system (session keys and cookies).
- The next logical step before collecting sensitive data (like login credentials via HTTPS POST requests) would involve ensuring they can maintain their access or set up the conditions necessary for the collection.

The manipulation of session keys and cookies can be seen as a form of **persistence**, as it helps in maintaining access to the webmail accounts without needing to re-authenticate. This action would logically precede the collection of login credentials, as it ensures that Earth Wendigo can continue to access the necessary data streams (in this case, HTTPS POST requests).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial action: Manipulation of webmail session keys and browser cookies.
2. Determine the objective: Intercept HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.
3. Analyze tactics in relation to the actions and objective.

**Final Answer**: D is the tactic related to the objective, but considering the question asks for the tactic before collection, and given the nature of the actions described, the correct answer should reflect the action taken to facilitate or precede collection, which aligns more closely with ensuring continued access or setup for collection. However, based on the provided options and the logic of the attack sequence, the most fitting answer given the context provided would actually be related to the action of manipulating session keys and cookies to facilitate further malicious activity, which could be misconstrued. The correct interpretation of the sequence suggests that after manipulating session keys and cookies (which could be part of persistence or defense evasion), the next logical step in the attack sequence before collecting credentials would indeed be more closely related to **Collection** itself in the context of preparing for or facilitating it, but given the choices and the specific actions described, **Persistence (C)** seems to be the closest match in terms of maintaining access, which would be necessary before attempting to collect sensitive information like login credentials. 

However, re-evaluating the logic and the specific question asked, the focus is on what happened after the manipulation but before the collection of credentials. The manipulation itself can be seen as a method to ensure **persistence** or to **evade defense**, but since the question specifically asks for what happened after this manipulation and before the collection, and considering typical attack sequences, the action of manipulating session keys and cookies directly facilitates the collection by ensuring access, thus the tactic most likely aligning with the sequence provided, considering standard interpretations of these tactics, would indeed be **Collection (D)**, as it directly follows the manipulation in the sequence of actions aimed at gathering sensitive information.

**Final Answer**: D
