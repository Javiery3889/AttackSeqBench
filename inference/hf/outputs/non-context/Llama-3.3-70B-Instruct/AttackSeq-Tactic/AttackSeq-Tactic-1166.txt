To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Powersing employed security software evasion techniques and before leveraging periodic screenshots and execution of arbitrary PowerShell scripts, let's analyze the sequence of events described:

1. **Employing security software evasion techniques**: This indicates the adversary is trying to avoid detection by security tools, which aligns with the "Defense Evasion" tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **after** this step, so we're looking for what happens next in the attack sequence.

2. **Leveraging periodic screenshots and execution of arbitrary PowerShell scripts from the C&C server**: This action suggests the adversary is collecting information (screenshots) and possibly preparing for further exploitation or maintaining access (execution of arbitrary scripts). The collection of screenshots directly points towards the "Collection" tactic, as it involves gathering information about the target system or environment.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining an initial foothold on the system. Since the question describes actions taken after security evasion techniques were employed, initial access has likely already occurred.

- **B: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion is mentioned in the question as part of the sequence, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **after** this step.

- **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or environment. The action of taking periodic screenshots fits well within this tactic, as it's a method of collecting information about what's happening on the compromised system.

- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary removing data from the target system. While taking screenshots could potentially be part of data collection for exfiltration, the execution of arbitrary PowerShell scripts suggests a broader set of actions that could include but are not limited to exfiltration.

Based on the sequence provided, the most plausible next step after defense evasion and before leveraging periodic screenshots and script execution is the collection of information about the system, which aligns with the "Collection" tactic.

Final Answer: C
