To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT33 employed multiple layers of obfuscation for their C&C servers and before they operated live C&C servers to issue commands, let's break down the scenario and analyze the options provided.

1. **Analyzing the Scenario**: 
   - **Initial Action**: APT33 employed multiple layers of obfuscation for their Command and Control (C&C) servers using cloud-hosted proxies. This action is primarily aimed at hiding the true location and identity of the C&C servers, making it difficult for defenders to detect and block them. This falls under **Defense Evasion** (C), as the primary goal is to evade detection.
   - **Subsequent Action**: The question asks for the tactic that occurred after this obfuscation and before APT33 started operating about a dozen live C&C servers to issue commands. This implies we are looking for a tactic that would logically precede the active management of botnets through C&C servers.
   - **Objective**: The ultimate goal here seems to be the management and control of compromised systems (botnets), which suggests that the missing tactic should facilitate or be a prerequisite for this control.

2. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This is the tactic of using C&C servers to issue commands to compromised systems. However, the question specifies that the operation of live C&C servers to issue commands is the subsequent action, not the preceding one.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. While discovery is crucial in the initial stages of an attack, the scenario provided suggests that APT33 has already set up obfuscated C&C servers, implying they have moved past the initial discovery phase.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: As mentioned, the initial action of employing obfuscation techniques for C&C servers falls under Defense Evasion. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this action.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information relevant to the target. Given that APT33 has set up obfuscated C&C servers and is preparing to operate them, it's plausible they would need to collect specific information about their targets or the environment to effectively issue commands and manage the botnets.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial action (obfuscation of C&C servers) is aimed at evasion.
   - The subsequent action (operating C&C servers) is about command and control.
   - The missing piece should logically connect the setup of C&C infrastructure with its active use, likely involving gathering necessary information for targeted operations.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the context, **Collection (D)** seems the most plausible tactic. It would involve gathering information necessary for the targeted operation of the botnets, which would occur after setting up the C&C infrastructure and before actively using it to issue commands. This information could include details about the compromised systems, network layouts, or specific targets within the compromised networks.

Final Answer: D
