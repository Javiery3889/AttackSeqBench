To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that CosmicDuke searched for files on both hard drives and network drives that matched specific patterns, including various non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers. This action implies that the adversary is looking for specific data, possibly to exfiltrate or to understand the environment better.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The action described involves searching for specific files, which can be mapped to the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** this action. The Discovery tactic (TTP: T1204 - User Execution: Search for Files) involves the adversary searching for files, which aligns with the described behavior.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While possible after discovering files, it's not directly related to the action of searching for files unless the files contain information that facilitates lateral movement.
   - **B: Discovery**: This is the tactic that involves gathering information about the system or network. The described action fits within this tactic, but the question asks for what comes after.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling the compromised system. Searching for files could be a precursor to establishing command and control if the files contain information necessary for setting up a C2 channel, but it's not the most direct next step.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which could be the next logical step after discovering where the desired data is located. If CosmicDuke found files related to encryption ciphers, the next step could be to collect this information for further use, such as exfiltration or to aid in further compromise.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The action described (searching for files) is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely follows this action.
   - Given that the adversary has identified files of interest, the next logical step would be to collect this data for further analysis or use.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step after discovering files of interest would be to collect this data. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after CosmicDuke searched for files is Collection.

Final Answer: D
