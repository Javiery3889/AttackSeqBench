To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before OceanLotus harvested credentials, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: OceanLotus is using custom-obfuscated Mimikatz payloads to harvest credentials. Mimikatz is a tool known for extracting plaintext passwords, hash, PIN code, and kerberos tickets from memory. This action is directly related to gaining access to credentials, which is a part of the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Analyzing the Tactic Options**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This is the tactic directly related to the action of harvesting credentials. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the credential harvesting.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher privileges. While it could be a step in the attack chain, especially if the initial access was with limited privileges, it's not necessarily a prerequisite for harvesting credentials, especially if the attackers already have sufficient access to run Mimikatz.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. Before harvesting credentials, attackers would likely want to understand the network layout and identify potential targets for credential theft, making this a plausible precursor.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While lateral movement could occur after credential harvesting to expand access, the question specifies that the credential harvesting is to "facilitate lateral movement," suggesting that the movement is a subsequent action.

3. **Conclusion**: Given that the attackers are using Mimikatz to harvest credentials for lateral movement, it implies they are looking to expand their access within the network. Before they can effectively do this, they would need to have some level of understanding of the network and its components. Thus, the most logical precursor to harvesting credentials for this purpose would be **discovery**, as it would provide the necessary information on where to focus their credential harvesting efforts and how to move laterally.

Final Answer: C
