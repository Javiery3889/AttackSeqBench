To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after BlueDelta collected emails and before it exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Action**: BlueDelta collected emails by automatically forwarding them to an attacker-controlled address. This action can be associated with the "Collection" tactic, as it involves gathering information (in this case, emails) from the victim's environment.

2. **Objective**: The ultimate goal here seems to be the exfiltration of sensitive data, specifically the Roundcube session cookie and address book. Exfiltration is the act of transferring data from a system without authorization, which aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic.

3. **Intermediate Steps**: Between collecting emails and exfiltrating specific data like session cookies and address books, an attacker would typically need to establish a means to control or interact with the compromised system or application. This could involve setting up command and control (C2) channels to issue commands or receive stolen data.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Collection**: This is what BlueDelta did initially by collecting emails, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this action.
  
- **B: Command and Control**: Establishing command and control is a crucial step for attackers to maintain access, issue commands, and receive data from the compromised system. This would logically occur after the initial collection of emails (to understand the environment or to use the collected information for further exploitation) and before the exfiltration of more sensitive data, as it provides the means to execute the exfiltration.

- **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves creating, purchasing, or compromising resources that can be used to support an operation. While it's an important aspect of an attacker's lifecycle, it doesn't directly fit the sequence described, which focuses on actions taken after initial collection and before exfiltration.

- **D: Exfiltration**: This is the final action mentioned in the scenario, where the attacker exfiltrates the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book. The question asks for the tactic that occurred before this exfiltration.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of events after collecting emails and before exfiltrating sensitive data involves establishing a means to control the compromised system or application, which aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic.

Final Answer: B
