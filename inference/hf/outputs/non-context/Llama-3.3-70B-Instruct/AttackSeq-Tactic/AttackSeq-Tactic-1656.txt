To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes a scenario where a PowerShell script is executed to run at the memory level. This indicates an initial stage of the attack where the adversary is trying to establish a foothold.
   - The downloading of main malware components suggests that the initial script was likely a dropper or a loader, designed to fetch the actual malicious payload.
   - The use of base64 encoded strings to create shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulate scheduled tasks is mentioned as a subsequent action. This action is aimed at maintaining the malware's presence on the compromised system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Execution**: The initial execution of a PowerShell script to run at the memory level falls under the "Execution" tactic. This is because the adversary is executing a malicious script to gain initial access or control.
   - **Persistence**: The creation of shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulation of scheduled tasks to maintain the malware's activities is a clear example of the "Persistence" tactic. This tactic involves techniques used by the adversary to maintain their presence within the system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This is the tactic that involves maintaining access to the system. Given that the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the malware employed methods to maintain its activities, Persistence is what is happening after the initial execution, not before.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code to achieve the adversary's goals. Given the context, the execution of the PowerShell script is an initial step, and the question asks for what likely occurred before the persistence methods were employed. However, execution is the initial step described, making it a strong candidate for what happened before persistence.
   - **C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. There's no mention of data theft in the scenario provided, making this choice less relevant.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher privileges on the system than initially granted. While this could be a part of the attack chain, the question does not specifically mention actions that would indicate privilege escalation as a necessary step before persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines an attack sequence starting with the execution of a PowerShell script (Execution) and followed by actions aimed at Persistence.
   - Given the sequence, the tactic that most likely occurred before the malware employed base64 encoded strings for persistence is the initial Execution of the malicious script.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the one that aligns with the initial step of executing the malicious code before the persistence methods were employed.

Final Answer: B
