To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question mentions SkinnyBoy collecting base64 encoded data from systeminfo, tasklist, and targeted directories.
   - It uses the CryptBinaryToStringA API, which suggests a process of converting binary data into a string format, likely for easier transmission or storage.
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic most likely used to transfer this collected data to the C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the C2 server for sending commands and receiving stolen data. While it's related to communication with the C2 server, it's broader than just data transfer.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B)**: This tactic involves exploiting vulnerabilities to increase privileges on a system. It doesn't directly relate to transferring data to a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic specifically involves transferring data from the compromised system to the attacker's system, which aligns with the action of sending collected data to a C2 server.
   - **Impact (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions to disrupt, manipulate, or exploit the system or data. While data exfiltration can be part of the impact, this category is broader and not specifically focused on data transfer.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions collecting and presumably sending data to a C2 server.
   - The action of transferring collected data (systeminfo, tasklist, and targeted directories) to the C2 server is a key aspect of the scenario.
   - Among the provided options, **Exfiltration (C)** is the most directly related to the transfer of data from a compromised system to an external entity (in this case, the C2 server).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in this context involves data exfiltration.

Final Answer: C
