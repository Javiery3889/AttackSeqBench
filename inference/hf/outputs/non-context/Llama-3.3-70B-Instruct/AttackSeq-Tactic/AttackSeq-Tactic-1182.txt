To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before APT28 deployed additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: APT28 is known for its sophisticated cyber attacks. The deployment of additional modules like pr.dll for uploading stolen data to a Command and Control (C&C) server indicates a stage in the attack where data exfiltration is the goal.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The question implies a sequence where the attackers have already gained access to the network and are now in the process of exfiltrating data. The deployment of additional modules for data upload suggests that the attackers have moved past the initial stages of the attack.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. While collection is indeed a part of the attack lifecycle, it is broad and could occur at various stages, including after initial access.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network to expand access. While lateral movement could be necessary for collecting more data, it doesn't directly precede the deployment of modules for data exfiltration in a logical sequence.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gaining knowledge about the system, network, or organization. Discovery would likely occur after initial access and could be a precursor to deploying specific modules for data exfiltration, as understanding the network and system is crucial for identifying what data to steal and how to exfiltrate it.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a target system. While execution is a critical step in the attack lifecycle, the deployment of additional modules for data exfiltration implies that execution has already occurred to some extent (i.e., the initial malware or backdoor has been executed).

4. **Determining the Most Likely Tactic**: Given that the attackers are deploying additional modules for data exfiltration, it suggests they have already gained access and are looking to exploit that access for data theft. The most logical precursor to this action would be **Discovery**, as understanding the network and identifying valuable data targets would be essential before deciding what data to exfiltrate and how to do it efficiently.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the goal of the attackers (data exfiltration).
2. Recognize the stage of the attack (post-initial access, pre-exfiltration).
3. Analyze each option in the context of the attack lifecycle.
4. Select the option that best fits as a precursor to deploying modules for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C**
