To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the sequence of events in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions that Poison Ivy's network communications were encrypted using the Camellia cipher and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443. This action is indicative of a specific tactic used by an adversary to hide their communications, making them less detectable by security measures.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key detail here is the encryption and blending of malicious traffic with normal SSL traffic. This is a technique used to evade detection, which falls under the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** this action.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gather information about the network, systems, or applications. While discovery can happen at various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly follow the action of encrypting and hiding communications as a necessary next step.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing a means for the adversary to issue commands to compromised systems or applications. Encrypting communications to evade detection would be a precursor to establishing a command and control channel, as it would help in maintaining a stealthy connection.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: The action described in the question (encrypting communications and blending them with normal traffic) is itself a technique under Defense Evasion. The question asks for what comes after, not the action itself.
   - **D: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques used by the adversary to maintain their presence within the network. While persistence is crucial for long-term access, the immediate next step after securing stealthy communication might not necessarily be persistence mechanisms.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The action of encrypting communications and blending them with normal SSL traffic is a method to avoid detection.
   - After securing a stealthy communication channel, the next logical step for an adversary would be to use this channel for command and control purposes, as it allows them to issue commands to the compromised system without being easily detected.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next tactic in the sequence, given the context provided, is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: B**
