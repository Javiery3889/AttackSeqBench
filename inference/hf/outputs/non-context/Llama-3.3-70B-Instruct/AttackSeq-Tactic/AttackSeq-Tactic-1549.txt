To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gathered information about the victim's computer, including the OS version, username, and anti-virus details. This information gathering is a precursor to the use of a backdoor for sending exfiltrated data (like files and screenshots) over a Command and Control (C&C) channel.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of events can be summarized as follows:
   - Information gathering about the victim's computer.
   - Use of a backdoor to exfiltrate data (files, screenshots) via a C&C channel.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C&C server. While the use of a backdoor for exfiltration does involve C&C, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after information gathering and before the use of the backdoor for exfiltration.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. The question states that information gathering has already occurred, so this is not the tactic that happened after the gathering of information.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. The scenario described does not explicitly mention movement between systems, so this may not directly apply.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used for future operations. Given that the attackers have already gathered initial information and are now in a position to use a backdoor for exfiltrating specific data (files, screenshots), this suggests a deeper level of collection beyond initial reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial information gathering about the victim's computer falls under **Reconnaissance**.
   - The subsequent action of using a backdoor to exfiltrate specific data indicates a deeper level of access and interest in collecting specific information, which aligns with the **Collection** tactic.
   - **Command and Control** is involved in the exfiltration process but is more about the mechanism of communication rather than the tactic of collecting data.
   - **Lateral Movement** is not directly indicated by the scenario provided.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the sequence of events and the focus on collecting specific data after initial reconnaissance, the most likely tactic to have occurred is **Collection**.

Final Answer: D
