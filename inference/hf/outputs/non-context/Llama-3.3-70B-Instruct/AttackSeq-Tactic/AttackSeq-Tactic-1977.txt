To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next in the sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Initial Infection and Defense Evasion**: The question starts with the malware using a self-extracting wrapper file to conceal the Gh0st payload. This action is a form of defense evasion, as it is intended to avoid detection by security software. The execution of the embedded DLL (Dynamic Link Library) of the Trojan is a method of executing the malicious payload, which is also part of the initial infection process.

2. **Establishing Communication**: After the malware has infected the system and evaded defenses, it establishes communication using a custom network protocol through its command and control (C2) server hosted at a specific IP address (98.126.67.114). This action is crucial for the malware's operation as it allows the attackers to issue commands, receive stolen data, and potentially update the malware.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves exploiting vulnerabilities or using other techniques to gain higher privileges on a system than those initially granted during the infection process. While privilege escalation is a common step in many attack sequences, the information provided does not directly indicate that privilege escalation occurred immediately after establishing communication with the C2 server.

- **B: Defense Evasion**: The initial actions described (using a self-extracting wrapper and executing a Trojan's DLL) are forms of defense evasion. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred next, after the malware has already evaded defenses and established communication.

- **C: Command and Control**: Establishing communication with a C2 server is a direct indicator of the Command and Control tactic. This tactic involves the malware communicating with the attacker's server to receive commands, send stolen data, or update the malware. The use of a custom network protocol to communicate with the server at 98.126.67.114 fits perfectly with this tactic.

- **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker developing resources, such as creating new tools or infrastructure, to support their operations. While establishing a C2 server could be considered part of resource development, the act of the malware communicating with an already established C2 server is more directly related to command and control.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) indicates that after evading defenses and executing the malware, the next step would be to establish command and control communications.

Final Answer: C
