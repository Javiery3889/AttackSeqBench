To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors into tactics.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 uses the Komplex Binder to deliver a dropper. The dropper is saved on the system, and a decoy PDF file is opened to initiate the attack. This sequence involves delivering malware (the dropper) to the victim's system and executing it, which is a critical step in the early stages of an attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - The use of the Komplex Binder to deliver the dropper indicates a technique used for **Initial Access** (getting initial access to the system).
   - Saving the dropper on the system and opening a decoy PDF to initiate the attack suggests the execution of the malware, which aligns with the **Execution** tactic (executing the malicious code on the system).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This is the tactic involved in gaining an initial foothold on the system. While the Komplex Binder is used for initial access, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **after** this step.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing the malicious code on the system. Given that the dropper is delivered, saved, and then executed (as implied by the initiation of the attack through a decoy PDF), this seems like the most immediate next step after initial access.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the system or network. While collection is a crucial part of many attacks, it typically occurs after the attacker has established a foothold and executed their tools on the system.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. It usually occurs after the attacker has established a foothold and gathered information about the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack starts with **Initial Access** (delivering the dropper).
   - The immediate next step described is the execution of the malware (**Execution**), as indicated by the saving of the dropper and the opening of a decoy PDF to initiate the attack.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that **Execution** occurs after the initial access tactic, as it directly follows the delivery and initiation of the malware.

**Final Answer: B**
