To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gained access to an organization's network using a Cobalt Strike beacon. They have mapped the internal network and compromised additional endpoints.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves network mapping and endpoint compromise, indicating the attackers are in the process of establishing a foothold within the network.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred next to facilitate communication with compromised systems and to check for new commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used to support operations. While it's a possible next step in a broader campaign, it doesn't directly relate to communicating with compromised systems or checking for new commands.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves executing code on a compromised system, which could be part of the process but doesn't directly address the need for ongoing communication and command execution.
   - **Exfiltration (C)**: This tactic involves removing data from the compromised system, which might happen later in the attack sequence but doesn't directly relate to the immediate need for command and control.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between compromised systems and the attackers' command and control servers. This would allow attackers to send commands to compromised systems and receive data back, fitting the scenario described.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have already gained access and are looking to communicate with compromised systems and check for new commands.
   - The primary goal at this stage is to maintain access and control over the compromised systems.
   - The tactic that directly supports this goal is establishing and maintaining **Command and Control**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence described is to establish Command and Control.

Final Answer: D
