To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where the Hellsing APT group uses spear-phishing documents with exploits to gain initial access to target systems.
   - After gaining access, the group's backdoor connects to a server to carry out actions like uploading and downloading files.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves gaining access and then communicating with a command and control (C2) server for further actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial entry point into a network. The question mentions that initial access was already gained through spear-phishing, so this is not the most likely next step.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server to issue commands and receive stolen data. The scenario describes the backdoor connecting to a server to upload and download files, which aligns with C2 activities.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target system or network. While discovery might occur after initial access, the specific actions of uploading and downloading files through a backdoor connection more directly suggest C2 communication rather than discovery activities.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. The question does not specifically mention movement between systems within the network but rather focuses on the communication between the compromised system and the external C2 server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial access has been achieved through spear-phishing.
   - The connection of the backdoor to the server for uploading and downloading files indicates the attacker is now controlling the compromised system remotely.
   - This remote control for the purpose of executing commands (like uploading and downloading files) is characteristic of Command and Control activities.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access is the establishment of Command and Control.

Final Answer: B
