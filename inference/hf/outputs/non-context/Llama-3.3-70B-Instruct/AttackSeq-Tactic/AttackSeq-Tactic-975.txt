To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after CosmicDuke used FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communicated with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: CosmicDuke is a type of malware. The use of FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates indicates that the attackers are maintaining and possibly updating their malware. Communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests suggests a method of command and control (C2) or potentially exfiltrating data, but given the context of updating malware, it leans more towards C2.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - **FTP and WebDav for malware updates**: This suggests the malware is being updated or maintained, which is part of the "Resource Development" tactic, as it involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure for the malware.
   - **Communication via HTTP GET requests**: This is a common method for command and control (C2) communications, suggesting the "Command and Control" tactic.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Exfiltration**: While possible, the primary action described (malware updates and C2 communication) doesn't directly imply data exfiltration as the next step.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher privileges on a system. The described actions don't directly lead to privilege escalation as a necessary next step.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This involves creating, purchasing, or compromising resources (like infrastructure) to support operations. The use of FTP and WebDav for updates fits into maintaining resources, but the question asks for what comes after.
   - **D: Command and Control**: Given the communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, this is directly related to establishing command and control, which is essential for the operation of malware like CosmicDuke.

4. **Conclusion**: The actions described (using FTP and WebDav for updates and communicating via HTTP GET requests) are directly related to maintaining the malware and communicating with it, which is a form of command and control. Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after these actions is related to the ongoing operation and control of the malware.

Final Answer: D
