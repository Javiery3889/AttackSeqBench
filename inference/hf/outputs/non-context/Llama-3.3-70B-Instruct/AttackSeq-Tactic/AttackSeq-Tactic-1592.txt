To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by threat actors.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Industroyer2 malware is used to disrupt operations at electrical stations and substations. This malware utilizes the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol, which is a standard for telecontrol in electrical engineering and power systems. After the deployment of Industroyer2, the execution of wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred is mentioned. Wipers are types of malware designed to erase data, making recovery difficult or impossible.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied through the deployment of Industroyer2.
   - **Execution**: The deployment and execution of Industroyer2 and subsequent execution of wipers (CaddyWiper and SoloShred) are mentioned.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the malware execution.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within an internal network. While possible, the question does not provide specific details about movement within the network after the execution of the wipers.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code, which has already been described in the question (deployment of Industroyer2 and execution of wipers). The question asks for the tactic after this execution.
   - **C: Impact**: This tactic involves the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or destroy systems and data. Given that wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred are designed to erase data, this aligns closely with causing impact on the target systems.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. While discovery might occur at various stages of an attack, the scenario described focuses on the execution of disruptive malware, not on gathering information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The deployment of Industroyer2 and the execution of wipers are actions intended to disrupt operations and destroy data.
   - The use of wipers indicates an intent to cause significant impact on the target systems by erasing data, which aligns with the Impact tactic.
   - Given the context, the most logical sequence after executing such disruptive malware would be to assess the impact or to continue causing damage, which is encapsulated by the Impact tactic.

**Final Answer: C**
