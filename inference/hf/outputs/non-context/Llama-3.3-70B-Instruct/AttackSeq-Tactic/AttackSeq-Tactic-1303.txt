To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the OceanLotus Group used a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook for command execution and data exfiltration, utilizing HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Action**: The OceanLotus Group has already gained access to the target system using a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook. This backdoor allows for command execution and data exfiltration. The use of HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control (C2) indicates that the attackers are communicating with the compromised system to issue commands and receive stolen data.

2. **Identify the TTPs**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned include:
   - **Command Execution**: The ability to execute commands on the compromised system.
   - **Data Exfiltration**: The act of transferring sensitive data from the compromised system to the attackers.
   - **HTTP and DNS Tunneling for C2**: Methods used for communicating with the compromised system without being detected.

3. **Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This is already being achieved through HTTP and DNS Tunneling, so it's not a subsequent action but a current or ongoing tactic.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This involves gathering information about the target system or network. While it's a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, the question implies that the attackers have already gained access and are executing commands and exfiltrating data, suggesting they are past the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **C: Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration is mentioned as part of the current activities. However, considering the context, it's possible that exfiltration could continue or escalate as a subsequent action after establishing command execution capabilities.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves evading detection by the target's defensive systems. Given that the attackers are using novel backdoors and tunneling techniques for C2, defense evasion is likely an ongoing concern to maintain access without being detected.

4. **Conclusion**: Considering the attackers have already established a foothold, are executing commands, and exfiltrating data, the most immediate concern for them would be to **continue** these activities without being detected. While exfiltration (C) is a strong candidate because it directly follows from the described actions, the question asks for the tactic most likely to occur **after** these actions. Given the context, **Defense Evasion (D)** becomes a critical tactic to ensure the continued success of their operations (command execution and data exfiltration) by avoiding detection.

**Final Answer: D**
