To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions the use of "obfuscated loaders to execute the Korplug variant." This indicates an initial stage of the attack where the attackers are trying to evade detection by using obfuscated (hidden or disguised) methods to load malware.
   - It then mentions "collecting extensive data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives." This action suggests a phase of the attack focused on gathering information.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial action involves executing malware (Korplug variant) via obfuscated loaders. This is indicative of an attempt to evade security measures, which aligns with the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
   - The subsequent action is about collecting data, which directly corresponds to the "Collection" tactic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Collection** - This is the tactic of gathering information relevant to the attacker's goals. While it is mentioned in the question as part of the attack sequence, the question asks for the tactic that occurred between the initial evasion and the collection of data.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves evading detection by security controls. The use of obfuscated loaders to execute malware fits this description, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this initial evasion and before data collection.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker learning about the system, network, or organization. Given that the attackers are between evading defenses and collecting extensive data, it's plausible they would need to discover what data is available and where it's located.
   - **D: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker creating, purchasing, or stealing resources (like malware or infrastructure) to support their operations. While resource development is crucial for attackers, the question's context doesn't directly suggest this as the immediate next step after evasion and before collection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers first evade defenses (Defense Evasion) by using obfuscated loaders to execute the Korplug variant.
   - Before they can collect extensive data, they would logically need to understand what data is available and where it is located on the system, removable media, and network shared drives. This step aligns with the **Discovery** tactic, as it involves exploring and mapping out the environment to identify potential data sources.
   - The collection of data itself is the next step mentioned, which aligns with the Collection tactic.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events and the need for the attackers to understand the environment before collecting data, the most plausible tactic that occurred during Mustang Panda's campaign, after the initial evasion and before the data collection, is **Discovery**.

Final Answer: C
