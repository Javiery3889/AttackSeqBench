To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions the collection of email accounts using Microsoft Outlook MAPI. This indicates an action where data (in this case, email accounts) is being gathered or harvested.
   - It then mentions that the collected data is sent to the actors' infrastructure through a POST web request. This action involves transferring the collected data from the compromised system to the attackers' servers or command and control (C2) systems.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial action of collecting email accounts can be associated with the **Collection** tactic, as it involves gathering data.
   - The subsequent action of sending the collected data to the actors' infrastructure via a POST web request can be associated with **Exfiltration**, as it involves transferring data from the compromised system to the attackers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the initial entry point into a network or system. While collecting email accounts could be part of an initial access tactic, sending data via a POST request doesn't directly align with gaining initial access.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attackers' C2 systems. While sending data via a POST request could be part of C2 communication, the primary focus here seems to be on data transfer rather than command and control.
   - **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves transferring data from the compromised system to the attackers. Sending collected data via a POST web request directly aligns with this tactic.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data. While the initial collection of email accounts aligns with this, the question specifically asks about sending the data, not the collection itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes two main actions: collecting data and sending that data to the attackers' infrastructure.
   - The action of sending collected data via a POST web request to the attackers' infrastructure best aligns with the **Exfiltration** tactic, as it involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attackers.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is **Exfiltration**.

Final Answer: C
