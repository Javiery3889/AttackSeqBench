To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the attackers executed commands and injected processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of commands like `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` for enumeration in the victim's environment. These commands are typically used for gathering information about the current user and network computers, respectively. The use of Cobalt Strike Beacon for executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers indicates a level of access and control that allows for lateral movement and further exploitation.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) here involves:
   - **Enumeration**: Using `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` suggests the attackers are gathering information about the environment, which aligns with the "Discovery" tactic.
   - **Lateral Movement**: The use of Cobalt Strike Beacon to execute commands and inject processes on remote computers indicates movement within the network, exploiting gained access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: While credential access might be necessary for the actions described, the question focuses on the actions taken after gaining access, not the method of gaining access itself.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This is a strong candidate because the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon to interact with remote computers directly implies movement within the network. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this action.
   - **C: Discovery**: The enumeration activities (using `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer`) directly align with the "Discovery" tactic, which involves gathering information about the environment. This would logically precede the lateral movement and exploitation activities.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic involves causing direct impact on the environment, such as data destruction or denial of service, which is not directly related to the preparatory and exploratory actions described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first need to understand the environment, which involves **Discovery** (using commands like `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer`).
   - After discovering the environment, they can then move laterally and execute commands on remote computers, which is facilitated by tools like Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before the execution of commands and injection of processes on remote computers is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C**
