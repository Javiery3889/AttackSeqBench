To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors into tactics and techniques.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that after Machete utilized standard FTP and HTTP ports to communicate with its command and control (C2) servers and implemented fallback channels for document exfiltration, we need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely followed.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - The use of standard FTP and HTTP ports for C2 communication can be associated with the "Command and Control" tactic, as it involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the C2 server.
   - Implementing fallback channels for document exfiltration suggests a plan for transferring data from the compromised system to the adversary, which aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Credential Access (A)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. While credential access might be necessary for the initial compromise or for moving laterally within a network, the question focuses on communication with C2 servers and exfiltration, not on obtaining credentials.
   - **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves transferring data from the compromised system to the adversary. The mention of "document exfiltration" directly aligns with this tactic, as it involves the transfer of data (documents) out of the compromised environment.
   - **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves evading detection by the system's defenses. While using standard ports might be a form of evasion, the primary focus of the question is on the communication with C2 servers and the exfiltration of documents, not on evading defenses.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the C2 server. The use of standard FTP and HTTP ports for this purpose aligns with this tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question outlines two main actions: communication with C2 servers and implementing fallback channels for document exfiltration.
   - The action of communicating with C2 servers using standard ports directly relates to the "Command and Control" tactic.
   - However, the question asks for the tactic that "most likely followed" after these actions, which implies looking at the consequence or the next logical step after establishing C2 and preparing for exfiltration.
   - Given that exfiltration is the act of transferring data out of the environment, and the question mentions implementing fallback channels for document exfiltration, this suggests that the primary goal after establishing C2 is to exfiltrate data.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the focus on transferring documents out of the compromised system after establishing communication with C2 servers, the most logical next step in the attack sequence described is exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
