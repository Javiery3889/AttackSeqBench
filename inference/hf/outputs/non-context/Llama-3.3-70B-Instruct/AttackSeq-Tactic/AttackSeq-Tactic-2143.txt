To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that initial access was gained through a trojanized version of the CCleaner application. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic, which involves gaining an initial foothold within a network or system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after initial access and before gathering system profile information.

2. **Gathering System Profile Information**: This activity is part of the "Discovery" tactic, which involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, or environment they have compromised. This can include OS version, installed software, network configuration, and more.

Given the sequence:
- **Initial Access** has already occurred (through the trojanized CCleaner application).
- The next step mentioned is **gathering system profile information**, which is part of the "Discovery" tactic.

The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** initial access and **before** gathering system profile information. Since "Initial Access" has already happened, and "Discovery" (gathering system profile information) is the next mentioned activity, we need to consider what typically happens between these two phases in an attack sequence.

**Execution** is a tactic that involves executing malicious code or commands on a compromised system. After gaining initial access, an adversary would likely need to execute their malicious payload or tools to begin their operations, which could include preparing for or directly facilitating the gathering of system information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access is gained.
2. To perform any subsequent actions, including gathering system information, the adversary needs to execute their tools or code on the compromised system.
3. The execution of these tools or code enables the adversary to then gather system profile information as part of the discovery phase.

**Final Answer**: D: Execution
