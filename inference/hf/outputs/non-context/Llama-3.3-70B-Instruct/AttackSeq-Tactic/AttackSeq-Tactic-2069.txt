To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where spyware is delivered through spearphishing emails with executables disguised as PDF documents. Before this, it mentions the use of techniques for evasion and disguise but focuses on the delivery method of the spyware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) mentioned here involves delivering malware through spearphishing emails. This is a common initial infection vector used by attackers to gain access to a target system or network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before attacking. While reconnaissance is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, the delivery of spyware via spearphishing emails is not primarily about gathering information but about gaining access.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves successfully establishing a foothold within a network or system. Delivering spyware through spearphishing emails directly aligns with this tactic, as the goal is to initially access the target system.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic is about the attacker learning more about the system or network after gaining access. The described action of delivering spyware is a step before the discovery phase.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: While the question mentions techniques used for detection evasion (like VMProtect and disguising spyware), the specific action of delivering spyware via spearphishing emails is more about gaining initial access than evading defenses.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the delivery of spyware through spearphishing emails, which is a method used to gain initial access to a system.
   - The tactics mentioned (disguising spyware, using VMProtect) are indeed related to defense evasion, but these are secondary to the initial delivery method.
   - The primary goal of delivering spyware in this context is to establish a foothold within the target system, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.

**Final Answer: B**
