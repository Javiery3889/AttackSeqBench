To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors into tactics and techniques.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The Sednit group executed a downloader, which suggests they have already gained some level of access to the victim's system. The actions described (issuing commands, collecting data, evading defenses by deleting files and killing processes) indicate several phases of an attack.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - Executing a downloader typically falls under "Execution" (TA0002) in the ATT&CK framework, as it involves running malicious code on a victim's system.
   - Issuing commands and collecting data could relate to "Command and Control" (TA0011) and "Collection" (TA0009), respectively.
   - Evading defenses by deleting files and killing processes directly points to "Defense Evasion" (TA0005).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a system. While it's plausible that after executing a downloader, an attacker would want to maintain access, the question asks what occurred before defense evasion.
   - **Reconnaissance (B)**: This involves gathering information about the target. Given that the Sednit group is already executing commands and collecting data, reconnaissance likely happened before these actions but isn't directly related to the sequence leading up to defense evasion in this context.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C)**: This tactic is about gaining higher privileges on a system. If the Sednit group is issuing commands and collecting data, they may have needed to escalate privileges first to perform these actions effectively, especially if they intended to evade defenses afterward.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: The question mentions this tactic as something that happened after the initial actions, so it's not what we're looking for as a preceding tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Sednit group executed a downloader, indicating they have some level of access.
   - To effectively issue commands and collect data, especially in a way that would necessitate evading defenses, they likely needed higher privileges.
   - Thus, the most plausible tactic that occurred before evading defenses is escalating their privileges to perform more impactful actions.

**Final Answer: C**
