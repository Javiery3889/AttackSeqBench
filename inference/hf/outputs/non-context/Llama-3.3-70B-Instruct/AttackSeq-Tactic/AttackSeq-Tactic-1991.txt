To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework tactics.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where the Lazarus group gains initial access through malicious Word documents with macros. This is a method of gaining initial access to a system. After this initial access, the group aims to achieve persistence by auto-executing the next stage loader-type malware. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two points.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - **Initial Access**: Gaining access to the system through malicious Word documents with macros.
   - **Unknown Tactic**: The tactic we are trying to identify.
   - **Persistence**: Achieving persistence by auto-executing the next stage loader-type malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (C)** is the method used to gain entry into the system, which is already identified in the question.
   - **Execution (A)** involves executing malicious code on the system, which could include running the macros in the Word documents but also encompasses the execution of any subsequent malware, including the next stage loader-type malware aimed at achieving persistence.
   - **Persistence (D)** refers to the tactics used to maintain access to the system, which is mentioned as the end goal after the unknown tactic.
   - **Impact (B)** involves the tactics used to disrupt, corrupt, or destroy systems and data, which does not directly fit the sequence of gaining access and then achieving persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Lazarus group first gains **Initial Access** through malicious documents.
   - To achieve **Persistence**, they need to execute their malware. The execution of the initial malware (macros) leads to the execution of the next stage loader-type malware.
   - **Execution** is the tactic that involves running or executing malicious code, which is necessary for the transition from initial access to achieving persistence.
   - **Impact** is not directly related to the sequence of gaining access and maintaining it.
   - **Persistence** is the goal after the unknown tactic, not the tactic itself.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the sequence and the need for the malicious code to be executed to move from initial access to persistence, the most plausible tactic is **Execution**.

Final Answer: A
