To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) Mentioned**:
   - The question mentions the exploitation of CVE-2017-0199 and the use of macros in files. Both of these methods are techniques used for gaining initial access to a system. 
   - CVE-2017-0199 is a vulnerability that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, and using macros in files can lead to code execution as well, typically through social engineering tactics to get a user to open a malicious document.

2. **Understand the ATT&CK Tactics**:
   - **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker's initial entry point into the network. Techniques under this tactic include exploiting vulnerabilities (like CVE-2017-0199) and using spearphishing attachment (which could involve malicious macros).
   - **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used by attackers to evade detection. While defense evasion is a crucial aspect of an attack, it typically occurs after initial access has been gained.
   - **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control servers. It might not directly follow initial access but is more about preparing for sustained operations.
   - **Command and Control (D)**: This tactic is about establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control server. It logically follows initial access, as the attacker needs to be inside the system to establish C2 communication.

3. **Determine the Most Likely Next Tactic**:
   - Given that the question describes methods used for gaining **Initial Access**, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to establish **Command and Control**. This is because, after gaining access, an attacker would typically want to communicate with the compromised system to execute further commands, steal data, or move laterally within the network.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the sequence of events described, the most plausible next tactic after gaining initial access through exploiting CVE-2017-0199 or using macros in files would be to establish **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: D
