To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the given scenario and determining the most likely subsequent ATT&CK tactic.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions Longhorn's malware communicating with its Command and Control (C&C) servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This indicates that the malware has already been deployed on the target system and has established communication with its C&C servers, which is a key aspect of the "Command and Control" (C2) tactic.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves the initial compromise (not explicitly mentioned but implied as the malware is already communicating with C&C servers), followed by the establishment of command and control. The use of a custom cryptographic protocol for C2 communication is a technique to maintain stealth and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, or organization. While discovery can occur at various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly follow the establishment of C2 in a logical sequence, especially when considering the context of protecting communications.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. Exfiltration could be a goal after establishing C2, as the adversary now has a secure channel to extract data. However, the question focuses on the protection of communications rather than the transfer of data itself.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic is about the adversary moving through the network to expand their control. Establishing secure C2 is often a precursor to lateral movement, as it provides a means to issue commands to move laterally within the network.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This is the tactic that has already been described in the question. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this point.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has established secure communication with its C&C servers.
   - The next logical steps for an adversary would involve using this established communication channel for further malicious activities.
   - Lateral movement (C) is a plausible next step as it leverages the established C2 channel to issue commands that facilitate movement within the network.
   - Exfiltration (B) could also be a next step but is more directly related to data theft rather than the immediate actions following secure C2 establishment.
   - Discovery (A) and the fact that Command and Control (D) is already happening make these less likely as the immediate next steps in this specific context.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of the question, which emphasizes the establishment of secure command and control communications, the most logical next step in the attack sequence would be to use this channel for **lateral movement** to expand access within the network. 

Final Answer: C
