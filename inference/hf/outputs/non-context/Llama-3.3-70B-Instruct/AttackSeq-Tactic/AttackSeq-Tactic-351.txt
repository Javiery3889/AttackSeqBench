To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions collecting data from an infected iOS device and managing communication with attackers while enabling remote updates and module management. The key elements here are "collecting data," "managing communication," "remote updates," and "module management."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied involves initial infection (not directly mentioned but implied as the device is infected), data collection, and then the management of the infected device for further malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While data collection is mentioned, the question hints at a broader scope that includes managing communication and enabling updates, which goes beyond just collecting data.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic is about gathering information to plan an attack. The scenario described seems to be past the reconnaissance phase since the device is already infected.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised devices to execute commands. It fits well with "managing communication," "remote updates," and "module management" as these are key aspects of commanding and controlling compromised devices.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic is about creating, purchasing, or stealing resources (like malware or infrastructure) to support an attack. While resource development is crucial for attackers, the question focuses on post-infection activities rather than the development of resources.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes activities that occur after the initial infection of a device.
   - The focus is on managing the infected device, which includes collecting data, communicating with the attackers, and enabling updates and module management.
   - Among the given options, **Command and Control (C)** is the tactic that most closely aligns with these activities, as it involves maintaining communication with compromised devices and executing commands, which can include updating malware or managing modules on the infected device.

Final Answer: C
