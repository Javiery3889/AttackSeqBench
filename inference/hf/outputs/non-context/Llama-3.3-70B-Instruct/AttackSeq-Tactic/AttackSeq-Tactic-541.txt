To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the given information in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that the NewPass agent has established communication with a command-and-control (C2) server. This communication involves using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests. The establishment of C2 communication is a key aspect of the ATT&CK framework, specifically under the "Command and Control" tactic.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - Establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - Using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the C2 server. The use of a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests fits within this tactic as it's a method used to hide or disguise the communication.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attacker. While exfiltration could occur after establishing C2, the specific action of using custom encryption for HTTP POST requests is more directly related to maintaining stealthy communication rather than the act of exfiltrating data itself.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system or network. The actions described do not directly relate to discovering new information about the system but rather to communicating with the C2 server.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which could be a subsequent step after establishing C2. However, the specific action of using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP requests is more about the communication method than the collection of data itself.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes the establishment of communication and the use of encryption for HTTP requests, which is a method used for Command and Control.
   - The action of using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests is directly related to maintaining secure and stealthy communication with the C2 server.
   - While exfiltration, discovery, and collection could all potentially occur after establishing C2, the specific details provided in the question most closely align with the tactics involved in Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A**
