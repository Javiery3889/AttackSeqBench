To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors into tactics and techniques.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions Dridex, a type of malware, communicating with command and control (C&C) servers. This communication is done via encrypted POST requests and includes system information. Before this communication, the execution of embedded macros in malicious email attachments is mentioned as a preceding action.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The execution of embedded macros in malicious email attachments is a technique used for gaining access to a system.
   - The communication with C&C servers for sending system information suggests that the malware has already gained access to the system and is now possibly exfiltrating data or receiving further instructions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the victim's system. While exfiltration could occur after the initial access and execution of malware, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the execution of embedded macros, not after.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining an initial foothold on the system. The execution of embedded macros in malicious email attachments is a common technique used for initial access. Therefore, this tactic aligns well with the action described before the communication with C&C servers.
   - **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary executing malicious code on the system. While execution is indeed what happens when the macros are run, the question seems to ask for the tactic that precedes this execution in the context of the attack sequence, not the execution itself.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary evading detection and defense mechanisms. While defense evasion techniques might be used throughout an attack, the question focuses on the sequence leading up to the execution of macros, which is more directly related to gaining access than evading defenses.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The execution of embedded macros is a method of executing malicious code, which is a technique under the Execution tactic but is directly facilitated by an initial entry point.
   - The question hints at looking for the tactic that occurred before this execution, implying we are looking for how the adversary initially interacted with the system to set up the conditions for the macro execution.
   - Given that the execution of macros from email attachments is a common initial access technique, the tactic that most likely occurred before this execution is the adversary's attempt to gain initial access to the system.

**Final Answer: B**
