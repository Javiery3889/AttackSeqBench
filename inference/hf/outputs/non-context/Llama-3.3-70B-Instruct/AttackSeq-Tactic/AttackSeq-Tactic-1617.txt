To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Earth Lusca executed malicious scripts and created services pretending to be system update services, and before they gained elevated permissions by bypassing User Account Control (UAC), let's analyze the sequence of events and the tactics involved.

1. **Execution of Malicious Scripts and Creation of Services**: The initial step involves executing malicious scripts and creating services that masquerade as system update services. This action is primarily associated with the "Execution" tactic (Tactic ID: TA0002), as it involves running malicious code on the victim's system.

2. **Gaining Elevated Permissions by Bypassing UAC**: The subsequent step mentioned is gaining elevated permissions, which is achieved by bypassing User Account Control (UAC). This action falls under the "Privilege Escalation" tactic (Tactic ID: TA0004), as it involves exploiting vulnerabilities or using techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system.

Given these two steps, we need to identify which tactic is most likely to occur between them. The options provided are:
- A: Execution
- B: Discovery
- C: Resource Development
- D: Persistence

Let's evaluate each option:
- **A: Execution** has already occurred as the initial step, so it's less likely to be the answer we're looking for in this sequence.
- **B: Discovery** (Tactic ID: TA0007) involves gathering information about the system, network, or organization. After executing malicious scripts and before attempting to escalate privileges, an attacker would likely want to understand the system's configuration, user accounts, permissions, and potential security measures to effectively plan the privilege escalation. This makes **Discovery** a plausible step in between.
- **C: Resource Development** (Tactic ID: TA0008) is about establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control servers or compromising third-party services. While important, this doesn't directly fit between the execution of scripts and the escalation of privileges in a straightforward attack sequence.
- **D: Persistence** (Tactic ID: TA0003) involves techniques that allow an attacker to maintain access to a system over time. While persistence is a critical aspect of an attack, the specific sequence described focuses on the initial execution and the subsequent escalation of privileges, making persistence less directly relevant to the immediate next step after execution and before privilege escalation.

Given the sequence of events, the most logical next step after executing malicious scripts (and creating fake system services) and before attempting to bypass UAC for elevated permissions would be to gather more information about the system, its users, and its defenses to inform the escalation attempt. This aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.

Final Answer: B
