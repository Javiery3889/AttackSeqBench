To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the adversary explored the target network, let's analyze the given information and the options provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that the adversary has already performed "Discovery" to locate relevant systems. Discovery (Tactic ID: TA0007) involves the adversary trying to gather information about the target system or network, such as the operating system, open ports, running services, and user accounts. This tactic is typically used early in the attack sequence to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

2. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic (Tactic ID: TA0006) involves the adversary trying to obtain credentials to access systems, data, or services. While credential access could be a goal after discovery, it's not necessarily the immediate next step after exploring the network.
   - **B: Discovery**: Since the question states that the adversary has already performed discovery, choosing this option again doesn't make sense in the context of looking for the next step in the attack sequence.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic (Tactic ID: TA0008) involves the adversary moving through a network to find other systems or data to exploit. After discovering relevant systems, an adversary would likely attempt to move laterally to access more systems, data, or to reach their ultimate objective.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic (Tactic ID: TA0002) involves the adversary executing malicious code on a compromised system. While execution is a critical step in many attacks, it might not directly follow the discovery phase without the adversary first attempting to access or move within the network.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The adversary has already performed discovery, indicating they have some knowledge of the network layout and potential targets.
   - The next logical step after identifying targets through discovery would be to attempt to access those targets, which could involve moving laterally within the network to reach them.
   - Lateral movement is a tactic that directly builds upon the information gathered during the discovery phase, as it involves using that information to navigate and expand access within the network.

**Final Answer: C**
