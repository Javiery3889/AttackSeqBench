To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Windows for initial access. They then use specific CVEs (CVE-2021-31956 and CVE-2021-31955) to escape the sandbox and inject malware into a system process. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described involves:
   - Initial Access: Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Windows.
   - Escaping the sandbox and injecting malware: Using CVE-2021-31956 and CVE-2021-31955.

3. **Understanding the ATT&CK Tactics**:
   - **Collection**: Involves gathering information about the system or network that could be used for future operations.
   - **Command and Control**: Establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control server.
   - **Impact**: Causing direct effects on the system or network, such as data destruction or disruption of service.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Increasing the privileges of the attacker's account to gain more access to the system.

4. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The action of exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access is a precursor to many other tactics. Given that the attackers then proceed to escape the sandbox and inject malware, it suggests they are moving from gaining access to establishing a foothold or preparing for further malicious activity.
   - **Privilege Escalation (D)** is the most likely tactic to occur after initial access and before actions like escaping the sandbox and injecting malware. This is because escaping the sandbox and injecting malware into a system process often require higher privileges than those initially obtained through exploiting a vulnerability for access.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Initial access is gained through exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - To effectively utilize the system for malicious purposes (like injecting malware into a system process), the attackers would likely need to escalate their privileges.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before utilizing the specified CVEs for sandbox escape and malware injection is **Privilege Escalation**.

**Final Answer: D**
