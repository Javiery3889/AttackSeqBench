To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Derusbi, a type of malware, gathers host information and sends it back via network beacons. It then binds to a random source port and communicates with a preconfigured destination port 443. The key elements here are the gathering of host information, the use of network beacons for communication, and the specific communication details (binding to a random source port and communicating over port 443).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve:
   - Gathering host information: This is related to the **Discovery** tactic, as it involves collecting information about the system or network.
   - Transferring information back via network beacons: This is indicative of **Command and Control (C2)** communication, where the malware communicates with its command and control server to send or receive data.
   - Binding to a random source port and communicating with a preconfigured destination port 443: This action is also part of establishing **Command and Control**. Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS traffic, which malware often leverages to blend in with legitimate traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the malware and the attacker's C2 server. Given that the malware is sending gathered information back and communicating over a preconfigured port, this aligns well with C2 activities.
   - **B: Collection**: While collection is indeed a part of what's happening (gathering host information), the question seems to focus on what happens after the collection, specifically the communication aspect.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**: There's no indication in the question that the malware is attempting to increase its privileges on the system, so this doesn't seem directly relevant.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic is about gathering information, which is part of what the malware does, but the question highlights the communication aspect post-discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The malware's action of gathering host information aligns with **Discovery**.
   - However, the focus of the question is on what happens after this information is gathered, specifically the communication method used.
   - The use of network beacons and communicating over a specific port (443) to a C2 server is a strong indicator of **Command and Control** activities.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic, given the context of the question, is **Command and Control** because it directly relates to the communication and potential command receipt or data exfiltration the malware is engaged in.

Final Answer: A
