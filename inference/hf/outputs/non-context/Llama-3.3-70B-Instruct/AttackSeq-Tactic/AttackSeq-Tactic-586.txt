To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions the deployment of GOLDBACKDOOR using obfuscated PowerShell scripts. GOLDBACKDOOR is a backdoor malware, and its deployment via obfuscated PowerShell scripts indicates an attempt to evade detection.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves using a backdoor (which implies establishing a persistent presence in the network) and evading detection mechanisms.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection and bypass security controls. The use of obfuscated PowerShell scripts to deploy GOLDBACKDOOR aligns with Defense Evasion, as the primary goal here is to avoid being detected by antivirus or endpoint security solutions.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic refers to the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or manipulate systems and data. While deploying malware like GOLDBACKDOOR could eventually lead to impact, the specific action described (deployment using obfuscated scripts) is more about evasion than causing immediate impact.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system or network. While GOLDBACKDOOR could be used for collection purposes once established, the act of deploying it with evasion techniques doesn't directly imply collection activities.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the adversary and the compromised system. Deploying a backdoor like GOLDBACKDOOR is indeed part of establishing Command and Control, but the specific mention of evasion techniques points towards the immediate goal of avoiding detection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The deployment of GOLDBACKDOOR using obfuscated PowerShell scripts is primarily aimed at evading detection, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - While Command and Control is a likely subsequent step after successful deployment, the question focuses on the immediate tactic following the deployment method described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after deploying GOLDBACKDOOR in such a manner, the adversary is engaging in Defense Evasion to maintain their presence without being detected.

Final Answer: A
