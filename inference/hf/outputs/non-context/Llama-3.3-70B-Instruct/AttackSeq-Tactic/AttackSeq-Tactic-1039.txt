To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions macOS threats like ChromeLoader and Operation In(ter)ception.
   - These threats established mechanisms such as Chrome extensions or LaunchAgents.
   - The purpose of these mechanisms is for maintaining long-term access on infected systems.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves establishing a mechanism for long-term access, which implies that the initial access has already been achieved.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, or organization. While discovery can occur at various stages of an attack, the question focuses on maintaining long-term access, not on the initial information gathering phase.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic is about how the adversary first gains access to the system or network. The question implies that initial access has already been achieved since mechanisms for long-term access are being established.
   - **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary's attempts to maintain their access to the system or network over time. Establishing Chrome extensions or LaunchAgents for long-term access directly aligns with persistence tactics.
   - **Execution (D)**: This tactic is about executing malicious code on the compromised system. While execution is a critical part of the attack sequence, the question specifically mentions mechanisms for maintaining long-term access, not the execution of code itself.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where threats have already gained access to the system and are now focusing on maintaining that access.
   - Establishing mechanisms like Chrome extensions or LaunchAgents is a method used to ensure that the adversary can remain on the system even after the initial access method is closed or discovered.
   - This directly aligns with the definition of **Persistence**, which is about maintaining access over time.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after establishing these mechanisms is related to maintaining long-term access.

Final Answer: C
