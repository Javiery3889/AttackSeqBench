To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The attackers have already gained initial access to the network by infecting some servers. They are now using these servers as a pivot point to manually spread across the network. The tool mentioned, "Explosive Trojan," suggests a malicious software designed to cause harm, potentially by spreading and infecting other systems.

2. **Identifying the TTPs**: The key TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) here involves using compromised systems to move laterally within the network. The use of a Trojan indicates a method for maintaining access and possibly executing further malicious activities.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial breach or entry point into a network. Given that the attackers are already inside the network and using infected servers as a pivot, this option does not align with the described activity.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through a network to find additional targets, often to exploit more systems or gain access to sensitive data. The scenario describes using infected servers to spread manually across the network, which fits this definition.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems. While command and control is likely a part of the overall attack, the specific action of spreading across the network using a Trojan suggests a focus on movement rather than just control.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. While execution is a necessary step in the attack, the scenario emphasizes the spreading or movement aspect rather than the execution of code itself.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the description of using initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network, the most relevant ATT&CK tactic is **Lateral Movement**. This is because the attackers are moving through the network, likely to infect more systems or reach specific targets, which aligns with the definition of lateral movement.

Final Answer: B
