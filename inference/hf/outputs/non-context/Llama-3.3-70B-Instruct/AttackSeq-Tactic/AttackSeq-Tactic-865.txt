To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the execution of "vba_macro.exe" via a Shell command, which leads to the execution of the BlackEnergy dropper. It asks about the ATT&CK tactic that would most likely ensure the dropper's execution on every system startup.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the execution of a malicious executable ("vba_macro.exe") and the goal of ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper runs on every system startup. This implies a need for a mechanism to maintain access or ensure continued execution of the malware after the initial infection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It doesn't directly relate to ensuring malware execution on startup.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another within an infected network. While important for spreading an attack, it doesn't directly ensure startup execution.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic is about maintaining communication between the malware and the attacker's command and control servers. It's crucial for receiving commands and exfiltrating data but doesn't directly pertain to ensuring the malware runs at startup.
   - **D: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system or network over time. Techniques under this category include modifying system settings or using malware that automatically runs at system startup, which aligns with the goal of ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper's execution at system startup, which implies a need for persistence.
   - Persistence (D) is the ATT&CK tactic that directly addresses mechanisms for maintaining access or ensuring continued execution of malware, such as adding the malware to startup folders, modifying registry run keys, or using other persistence techniques.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs related to ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup is associated with the Persistence tactic.

Final Answer: D
