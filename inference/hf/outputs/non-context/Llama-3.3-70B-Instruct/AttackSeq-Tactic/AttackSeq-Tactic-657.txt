To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT28 used spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages and before they exploited vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into victim networks, let's analyze the sequence of events described:

1. **Initial Access**: APT28 used spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages. This action corresponds to the "Initial Access" tactic, specifically the "Phishing" technique (T1566) and possibly "Credential Dumping" or "Input Capture" for harvesting credentials.

2. **Desired Intermediate Step**: We are looking for a tactic that likely occurred after the initial access (credential harvesting) and before exploiting vulnerabilities to move deeper into the network. This step involves using the harvested credentials for further malicious activities.

3. **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: The final step mentioned involves exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into victim networks. This corresponds to the "Exploitation of Remote Services" (T1210) under the "Initial Access" or "Lateral Movement" tactics, depending on the context of "moving deeper."

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher levels of access. While it could occur after initial access and before lateral movement, it's not directly implied by the use of harvested credentials to access systems.

- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials or other authentication material. Since APT28 already harvested credentials via spear-phishing, this doesn't fit as the next step after credential harvesting.

- **C: Resource Development**: This tactic is about establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control infrastructure. While important, it doesn't directly follow from using harvested credentials to access systems.

- **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving within a network to gain access to additional resources. Using harvested credentials to access systems and then moving laterally within the network to exploit vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers fits this description. Lateral movement often involves using legitimate credentials to access other parts of the network, which aligns with the sequence described.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. APT28 used spear-phishing for initial access and credential harvesting.
2. The next logical step with harvested credentials is to use them for accessing systems within the network.
3. Before or as part of exploiting vulnerabilities to move deeper, the attackers would use the accessed systems as a pivot point.
4. Lateral movement is the tactic that best describes using the initial access and credentials to move through the network, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities as part of this movement.

**Final Answer: D**
