To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Iron Tiger achieved persistence, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The goal here is to identify the tactic that precedes the achievement of persistence by Iron Tiger. Persistence in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework refers to the tactics and techniques used by an adversary to maintain their presence within a compromised environment.

2. **Analyzing the Given Information**: The question mentions that Iron Tiger achieved persistence via a new service or registry key after deploying a malicious executable. This executable contained a batch file and a cabinet file. The deployment of a malicious executable and the subsequent achievement of persistence indicate a series of actions taken by the adversary.

3. **Identifying Relevant ATT&CK Tactics**:
   - **Persistence (C)**: This is the tactic that involves techniques to maintain access to a compromised system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** persistence was achieved.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. Deploying a malicious executable to achieve persistence fits within the execution phase because the adversary needs to execute their code to establish persistence.
   - **Impact (A)**: This tactic is about the actions taken by an adversary to disrupt or destroy systems and data. It does not directly relate to the initial steps of establishing a foothold or maintaining access.
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves techniques used to gain initial access to a system or network. While initial access is a necessary precursor to persistence, the question specifically mentions the deployment of a malicious executable, which suggests that initial access has already been achieved.

4. **Determining the Most Likely Preceding Tactic**: Given that the adversary has already deployed a malicious executable and is working towards establishing persistence, the most immediate preceding tactic would be the one that involves running the adversary's code. This is **Execution (B)**, as it directly leads to the establishment of persistence through the execution of the malicious executable.

5. **Conclusion**: The tactic that most likely occurred before Iron Tiger achieved persistence is the execution of their malicious code, which is necessary for deploying the executable and subsequently achieving persistence.

Final Answer: B
