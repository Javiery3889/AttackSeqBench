To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after mapping the organization's internal network using Cobalt Strike and compromising additional credentials, the attackers compromised numerous workstations in search of critical information. The key elements here are:
   - Mapping the internal network.
   - Compromising additional credentials.
   - Using Cobalt Strike (a tool often used for post-exploitation and lateral movement).
   - Compromising numerous workstations.
   - Searching for critical information.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves initial access (not explicitly mentioned but implied), network mapping, credential compromise, and then movement within the network to find and possibly exfiltrate critical information.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. While collection does occur, the question hints at actions taken after initial collection and mapping.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations, either to support their operations or to obfuscate their activities. This doesn't directly relate to the actions described in the question.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system or network. Compromising additional credentials could be part of privilege escalation, but the question focuses on the movement and search for information after gaining these credentials.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access, often to specific data or systems. Given that the attackers used Cobalt Strike (a tool that facilitates lateral movement) and compromised numerous workstations after mapping the network and gaining credentials, this seems the most likely tactic to have occurred before the described actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first gained access to the network (implied).
   - They then mapped the internal network and compromised additional credentials, which could involve **Privilege Escalation (C)** but is more directly related to preparing for **Lateral Movement (D)**.
   - The use of Cobalt Strike and the action of compromising numerous workstations in search of critical information strongly suggests **Lateral Movement (D)** as the tactic that occurred before these actions.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)** is about moving through the network, which aligns with compromising workstations and searching for information.

**Final Answer: D**
