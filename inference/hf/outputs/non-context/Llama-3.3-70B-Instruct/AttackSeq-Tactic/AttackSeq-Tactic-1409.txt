To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after a trojanized version of the 3CX software was distributed in a supply chain attack, allowing Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Attack Vector**: The attack involves a trojanized version of the 3CX software, which means the malware (Smooth Operator) is disguised as legitimate software. This is a form of supply chain attack where the malware is introduced into the user's system through a trusted source (the 3CX software).

2. **Identifying the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This involves the attacker gaining an initial foothold on the system. In this case, the trojanized 3CX software serves as the initial access vector, allowing the Smooth Operator malware to enter the system.
   - **Execution (Tactic)**: After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to execute the malware (Smooth Operator) on the compromised system. Execution involves running the adversary's code on the victim's system, which could be to establish a foothold, escalate privileges, or move laterally within the network.

3. **Analyzing the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gain knowledge about the system, network, or organization. While discovery is a crucial part of the attack lifecycle, it is not the immediate next step after initial access through a trojanized software.
   - **B: Credential Access**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. It might be a subsequent step but not the immediate action following the initial access via malware.
   - **C: Execution**: Given that the malware has already gained initial access through the trojanized software, the next logical step is to execute the malware to achieve the attacker's objectives, such as establishing persistence, escalating privileges, or exfiltrating data.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that has already occurred through the distribution of the trojanized 3CX software. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this point.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access via a trojanized version of the 3CX software is the execution of the Smooth Operator malware to achieve the attacker's goals.

Final Answer: C
