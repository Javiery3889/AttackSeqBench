To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FIN4 transmitted stolen credentials along with campaign codes to its infrastructure, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: FIN4 is known for its activities involving the theft and exploitation of sensitive information, often related to financial and personal data. The transmission of stolen credentials along with campaign codes to their infrastructure suggests that FIN4 has already gained access to certain systems or networks and is now in the process of utilizing the stolen credentials for further malicious activities.

2. **Analyzing the Action**: The action of transmitting stolen credentials to their infrastructure implies that FIN4 is preparing to use these credentials for unauthorized access. This action follows the initial stages of an attack, such as phishing or other forms of credential harvesting, and precedes the exploitation of these credentials for data theft, lateral movement, or other malicious purposes.

3. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **A: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the removal of data from a system or network. While exfiltration could be a goal of FIN4 after obtaining credentials, the act of transmitting credentials to their infrastructure does not directly imply exfiltration is the immediate next step.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**: Establishing command and control involves setting up communication channels between compromised systems and the attacker's infrastructure. Transmitting stolen credentials to their infrastructure could be part of setting up or utilizing C2 channels, as it enables FIN4 to control access and movements within compromised networks.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials or gaining access to systems using credentials. Since FIN4 has already obtained and transmitted stolen credentials, this tactic has already been partially achieved. However, the transmission of credentials could be in preparation for further credential access attempts within the compromised network.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This involves gathering information about the target environment. While reconnaissance might occur at various stages of an attack, the specific action of transmitting stolen credentials suggests a move beyond initial information gathering.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that FIN4 has transmitted stolen credentials to their infrastructure, the most immediate next step would likely involve using these credentials to establish or utilize command and control channels. This would enable FIN4 to direct further malicious activities, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or additional credential access attempts.

Final Answer: B
