To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker, after evading detection, targets specific system information such as FTP client credentials or VPN configurations before gathering and exfiltrating system information. The key detail here is the targeting of credentials or configurations, which suggests an attempt to gain access to sensitive information that can be used for further malicious activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence mentioned involves:
   - Evading detection (which is related to Defense Evasion).
   - Targeting FTP client credentials or VPN configurations.
   - Gathering and exfiltrating system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker obtaining resources needed to support their operations, which might not directly relate to targeting credentials or configurations for immediate access.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the attacker trying to obtain credentials like passwords, keys, or other authentication data. Targeting FTP client credentials or VPN configurations directly aligns with attempting to gain credential access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - While mentioned in the initial part of the question as a method used by the attacker, the specific action of targeting credentials or configurations is not primarily about evading defenses but about gaining access.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves the attacker disrupting, destroying, or manipulating data and systems, which does not directly align with the action of targeting credentials for access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies actions taken after evading detection, focusing on targeting specific types of credentials or configurations.
   - The primary goal of targeting FTP client credentials or VPN configurations is to gain access to these systems or networks.
   - Among the provided options, **Credential Access** is the tactic that directly involves obtaining credentials or authentication data, which matches the described action of targeting FTP client credentials or VPN configurations.

**Final Answer: B**
