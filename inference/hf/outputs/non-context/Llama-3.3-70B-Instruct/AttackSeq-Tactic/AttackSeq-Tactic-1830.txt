To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by threat actors.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that RevengeHotels used spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2017-0199 to gain entry into the target systems. This information points to the initial stage of an attack where the adversary is attempting to gain access to the target's network or system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The technique described here involves spear-phishing (a social engineering attack) with malicious attachments that exploit a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199). This technique is used for gaining initial access to a system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This is the tactic of gaining an initial foothold within a network or system. The description provided in the question directly aligns with techniques used for initial access, such as phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to expand access and potentially identify additional targets. While lateral movement could occur after initial access, the question specifically describes the method of gaining entry, not moving within the network.
   - **C: Persistence**: Persistence tactics are used by an adversary to maintain their presence within a network over time. This could involve creating accounts, setting up scheduled tasks, or other methods to ensure continued access. The question does not describe actions taken after access is gained to maintain that access.
   - **D: Execution**: Execution refers to the tactic of executing malicious code or commands on a compromised system. While execution is a necessary step in the attack chain, the question focuses on the method of gaining entry, not the actions taken after entry to execute code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes the use of spear-phishing with malicious attachments to exploit a vulnerability, which directly corresponds to gaining initial access to a system.
   - The tactic of initial access is the first step in the attack chain where an adversary attempts to enter a network or system.
   - The other options (Lateral Movement, Persistence, Execution) are tactics that typically occur after initial access has been achieved.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the information provided and the analysis above, the most likely tactic to have occurred after the described action is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks which tactic "most likely occurred" after the initial access method was used, implying we are looking for the next step in the attack sequence after gaining entry. However, based on the standard attack sequence, after gaining initial access, an adversary would likely move to execute code or commands on the compromised system as part of their attack plan.

**Final Answer: D**
