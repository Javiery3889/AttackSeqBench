To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario involving the MoonBounce implant, which has established persistence.
   - It mentions the implant residing on the SPI flash, surviving disk formatting or replacement, and then operating in-memory only with a stealthy small footprint.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial step involves establishing persistence, which is a tactic where the attacker maintains their presence within the system.
   - The subsequent action involves the malware operating in-memory only with a small footprint, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Persistence**: While persistence is mentioned, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after persistence was established, specifically related to operating in-memory.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This involves gaining higher privileges, which is not directly related to operating stealthily in-memory.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker developing resources, such as malware or tools, but doesn't directly relate to evading detection by operating in-memory.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the attacker taking actions to evade detection, such as operating in-memory only to leave fewer artifacts for detection, which aligns with the described behavior of the malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The MoonBounce implant's ability to operate in-memory only with a stealthy small footprint after establishing persistence is a clear indicator of an attempt to evade detection.
   - Operating in-memory reduces the likelihood of the malware being detected by traditional signature-based detection methods, as it doesnâ€™t write any files to disk.
   - This behavior is characteristic of tactics used to avoid being detected by security software and system monitoring, fitting the description of Defense Evasion.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the description of the malware operating in-memory to maintain stealth, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is Defense Evasion, as it directly relates to the actions taken to avoid detection.

Final Answer: D
