To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT-TOCS executed shellcode script functionalities in memory and established multi-beacon communication for evasion, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Initial Actions**: 
   - **Shellcode Execution**: The execution of shellcode in memory is a technique used by attackers to run malicious code without writing it to disk, making it harder to detect. This action is typically associated with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as it involves running malicious code on a compromised system.
   - **Establishing Multi-Beacon Communication**: This action is related to command and control (C2) communications, where an attacker establishes communication with the compromised system to issue commands, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities. The use of "multi-beacon" suggests an attempt to evade detection by varying the communication patterns.

2. **Evaluating the Next Likely Tactic**:
   - Given that the attackers have already gained execution capabilities on the system and have established a means of command and control, the next steps would likely involve further establishing their foothold, gathering information, or moving laterally within the network.
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This is already partially achieved with the establishment of multi-beacon communication. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurs after this establishment, suggesting we're looking for what happens as a result of or in addition to this C2 setup.
   - **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as creating new accounts or backdoors. While possible, it's not the most direct next step after establishing C2.
   - **Credential Access (C)**: Obtaining credentials is a common next step after initial compromise, as it allows attackers to move laterally and access more systems or sensitive data. However, the question hints at actions taken after the initial compromise and C2 establishment.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network, often using the credentials obtained from the initial compromise. Given that the attackers have established a means of C2 and are looking to evade detection, moving laterally to expand their access within the network is a plausible next step.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Considering the attackers have already executed shellcode and established a means of command and control, and given the context of evasion and expansion, the most likely next tactic is to move laterally within the network to further their objectives, such as accessing sensitive data, disrupting operations, or spreading malware.

Final Answer: D
