To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the OceanLotus threat actors leveraged base64 blobs in malicious Office documents, let's break down the scenario and analyze the tactics provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where OceanLotus threat actors use base64 blobs in malicious Office documents. This action is related to executing malicious code on a victim's system, which aligns with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **before** this action.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The use of base64 blobs in malicious documents to execute code suggests that the threat actors have already gained some level of access to the victim's system or network, enough to deliver and execute the malicious documents.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the initial entry point into a network or system. The use of malicious Office documents could be a method of initial access, but the question implies that the documents are being used to execute code in a way that matches the victim's system architecture, suggesting some prior knowledge or access.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or organization. If the threat actors are using base64 blobs to execute code that matches the victim's system architecture, they likely had to gather information about the system first.
   - **C: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system or network. While important, the action described doesn't directly imply persistence but rather the initial exploitation or execution phase.
   - **D: Execution**: This is the tactic directly related to the action described (executing malicious code), but the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this action.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The threat actors' ability to match the victim's system architecture with their malicious code suggests they had prior knowledge of the system.
   - This prior knowledge is likely gained through reconnaissance or discovery activities.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the threat actors first gained some level of access (which could be through various means, including social engineering, exploiting vulnerabilities, etc.), then they likely performed **Discovery** to understand the system architecture, and finally used this knowledge to execute their malicious code effectively.

**Final Answer: B**
