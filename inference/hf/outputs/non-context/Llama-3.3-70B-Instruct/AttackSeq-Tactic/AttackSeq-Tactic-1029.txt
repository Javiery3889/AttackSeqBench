To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next after TidePool achieved persistence, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware, TidePool, has already achieved persistence through the use of an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry. This ensures that the malware launches on boot, which aligns with the "Persistence" tactic. However, the question asks about the next step after achieving persistence, specifically mentioning communication with a domain to execute remote commands.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key detail here is the communication with the domain 'goback.strangled[.]net' to execute remote commands. This indicates that the malware is now interacting with its command and control (C2) server.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: While defense evasion techniques might be used at various stages of an attack, the act of communicating with a C2 server to execute commands doesn't directly imply evasion tactics.
   - **B: Impact**: The impact tactic involves the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate the system or data. Executing remote commands could lead to impact, but the primary action described is the communication and command execution, not the impact itself.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the malware and the attacker's C2 server to send commands and receive data. The scenario directly mentions executing remote commands via communication with a domain, which fits this tactic.
   - **D: Persistence**: While persistence has already been achieved, as indicated by the malware launching on boot, the question asks for the next step after this achievement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already ensured it can persist on the system.
   - The next action involves communication with a C2 server.
   - This communication is for the purpose of executing remote commands.
   - The tactic that best aligns with communicating with a C2 server for command execution is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C**
