To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors into tactics and techniques.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with gaining initial access to the target system through malicious email attachments. This could involve techniques such as spearphishing attachment (T1566) or exploiting a vulnerability in software (e.g., T1204) to execute malicious code.

2. **Deployment of Main Malware Component**: After initial access, the main malware component is deployed. This step likely involves the execution of the malware, which could be categorized under the "Execution" tactic (TA0002), as it involves running the adversary's code on the victim system.

3. **Establishment of Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure**: The question mentions that after the deployment of the malware, the C2 infrastructure is established to manage encrypted communications and proxy connections. This directly relates to the "Command and Control" tactic (TA0011), which involves establishing a channel for controlling the malware and potentially exfiltrating data or issuing further commands.

Given the sequence of events:
- Initial access is gained.
- Malware is executed (deployment of the main malware component).
- C2 infrastructure is established for managing communications.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **before** the Command and Control infrastructure was established. Since the deployment of the malware (which involves its execution) happens after initial access and before the establishment of the C2 channel, the tactic that aligns with this sequence is "Execution".

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the sequence of events: Initial Access -> Deployment of Malware -> Establishment of C2.
2. Map these events to ATT&CK tactics: Initial Access (not directly asked but leads to), Execution (deployment of malware), and then Command and Control.
3. Determine which tactic occurs before C2 establishment: Execution is the tactic that directly precedes the establishment of the C2 infrastructure in this scenario.

**Final Answer: A**
