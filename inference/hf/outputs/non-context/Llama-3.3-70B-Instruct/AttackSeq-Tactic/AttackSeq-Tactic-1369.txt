To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FIN13 exploited external servers, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: FIN13 has already exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK). This action allows them to gain an initial foothold in the victim's network. The deployment of web shells and malware typically falls under the "Initial Access" tactic, as it involves gaining entry into the network.

2. **Establishing a Foothold**: With the web shells and malware in place, the next logical steps for an adversary like FIN13 would involve consolidating their access, ensuring they can maintain their presence in the network, and preparing for further actions. This often involves tactics that help in maintaining access, gathering more information about the network, or executing their malicious intentions.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that allow the adversary to maintain their access to the system or network over time, even after the initial exploit has been closed or patched. Given that FIN13 has already gained access and deployed tools (web shells and malware) that can be used for persistence, this is a plausible next step.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code or commands on a compromised system. While execution is certainly a part of the attack sequence, the deployment of malware and web shells already implies some level of code execution. However, this could still be relevant as the attackers might execute additional payloads or commands.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network, systems, and applications to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities. After establishing a foothold, discovering more about the internal network is a logical next step for planning further attacks or identifying valuable data.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials that can be used to access systems, applications, or data. While important for deeper penetration into the network, it might not be the immediate next step after establishing a foothold, unless the initial exploitation directly provided limited access and further credentials are needed for broader movement.

4. **Conclusion**: Considering the sequence of actions, after gaining initial access and deploying tools for maintaining that access, the next most logical step would involve either consolidating their position (persistence), gathering more information about the network (discovery), or preparing to move laterally or deeper into the network. Between these, **Persistence (A)** seems the most directly related to the actions described (deploying web shells and custom malware), as these tools can be used to maintain access. However, **Discovery (C)** is also a strong candidate because understanding the network is crucial for planning the next moves. Given the context that the question asks for the tactic most likely to occur **after** establishing a foothold, and considering typical attack patterns, **Persistence (A)** is slightly more directly related to the immediate post-exploitation phase described.

Final Answer: A
