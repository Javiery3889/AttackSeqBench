To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the RoyalDNS Backdoor**: The RoyalDNS backdoor is a malware tool used by APT15, a known advanced persistent threat group. This backdoor installs persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS (Domain Name System) tunneling for communication. The use of DNS for command and control (C2) communication is a tactic that allows the attackers to blend their malicious traffic with legitimate DNS queries, making detection more challenging.

2. **Analyzing the ATT&CK Tactics**:
   - **Persistence (A)**: This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to maintain their presence on the victim's network over time. The deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor itself is an example of achieving persistence, as it allows the attackers to maintain access to the victim's network.
   - **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing resources that can be used during the attack, such as setting up command and control infrastructure or obtaining additional capabilities. While resource development is crucial for an attack, the deployment of the backdoor is more directly related to maintaining access rather than developing new resources.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C)**: This tactic involves techniques used by attackers to gain higher levels of privilege on the system or network. While privilege escalation is a common step after initial access, the question focuses on the deployment of a backdoor, which is more directly related to maintaining access than escalating privileges.
   - **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker removing data from the victim's network. The deployment of a backdoor like RoyalDNS, which communicates through DNS, could be a precursor to exfiltrating data, as it provides a covert channel for data transfer.

3. **Determining the Most Likely Tactic**:
   - Given that the RoyalDNS backdoor is used for persistent communication and potentially for data exfiltration, the most logical next step after deploying such a backdoor would be to use it for its intended purpose, such as exfiltrating sensitive data from the victim's network.
   - **Exfiltration (D)** stands out as the most plausible next tactic because the backdoor's ability to communicate through DNS tunneling provides a means to transfer data out of the network without being easily detected.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the purpose and capabilities of the RoyalDNS backdoor.
2. Analyze each ATT&CK tactic in relation to the backdoor's deployment.
3. Determine which tactic is most directly related to the use of a persistent backdoor with C2 communication capabilities.

**Final Answer**: D
