To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers opened spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents with embedded links to gain initial access, let's break down the information provided and analyze the sequence of events.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers use spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links. The goal here is to gain initial access to a system, utilizing an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection. The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) starts with gaining initial access through phishing.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial action is phishing, which aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** gaining initial access. The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection suggests an attempt to evade security measures.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. While execution is a necessary step after initial access, the specific mention of avoiding detection through an undocumented feature points more towards evading defenses rather than the act of executing code itself.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This is the tactic used to gain entry into a system, which has already been accomplished according to the question.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection and bypass security mechanisms. The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection fits well within this category, as it is a method to remain undetected after initial access has been gained.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While reconnaissance might occur after initial access, the specific action described (using an undocumented feature to avoid detection) does not directly relate to gathering information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first gain initial access through spear phishing.
   - The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection indicates an effort to remain stealthy and not be caught by security software.
   - This action of avoiding detection aligns most closely with the Defense Evasion tactic, as it involves bypassing or evading security controls.

**Final Answer: C**
