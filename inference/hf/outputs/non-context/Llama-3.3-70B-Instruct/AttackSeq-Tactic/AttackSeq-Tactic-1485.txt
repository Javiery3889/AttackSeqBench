To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions BlackEnergy 3 malware gathering network information for lateral movement and then communicating with its C2 (Command and Control) server using the HTTP protocol.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involves network information gathering (likely for lateral movement) and communication with a C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exfiltration (A)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. While communication with a C2 server could potentially involve exfiltration, the primary purpose of communicating with a C2 server is not typically described as exfiltration.
   - **Impact (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate the target system or data. Communicating with a C2 server does not directly relate to causing impact.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the malware and the attacker's C2 server. This communication can be used for sending commands, receiving stolen data, or updating the malware, which aligns with the scenario described.
   - **Lateral Movement (D)**: While the question mentions gathering network information for lateral movement, the act of communicating with a C2 server using HTTP is not itself a method of lateral movement but rather a means to potentially facilitate further actions, including lateral movement, by receiving commands.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the malware communicating with its C2 server, which is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic.
   - The use of the HTTP protocol for this communication is a common technique used by malware to blend in with normal network traffic.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic that describes the malware communicating with its C2 server is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
