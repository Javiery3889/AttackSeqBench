To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where Shamoon malware has overwritten the disk's boot records, including the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR), which prevents access to the affected file systems.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves the malware's action of overwriting critical system areas, which is a technique, and we're asked to identify the tactic that most likely occurred after this action.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems. Overwriting boot records doesn't directly relate to establishing command and control channels.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic is about executing malicious code, which could include the initial infection vector for the Shamoon malware but doesn't directly follow the action of overwriting boot records as a consequence.
   - **Impact (C)**: This tactic involves causing direct effects on the system or network, such as data destruction or disruption of service. Overwriting boot records to prevent access to file systems directly aligns with causing impact.
   - **Discovery (D)**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target environment. Overwriting boot records is not a method of discovery but rather an action that disrupts system functionality.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The action described (overwriting disk boot records) is a technique that leads to a specific outcome: preventing access to affected file systems. This outcome is a direct result of the malware's action and is intended to cause harm or disruption.
   - The tactic that aligns with causing such disruption or harm is **Impact**. This is because overwriting boot records directly results in the inability to access file systems, which is a form of impact on the system's availability and integrity.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after the Shamoon malware overwrote the disk's boot records, the tactic that most likely occurred is related to causing an impact on the system.

Final Answer: C
