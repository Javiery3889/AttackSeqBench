To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already achieved privilege escalation using a 'fileless' UAC bypass and has injected code into Notepad.exe.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves:
     - Privilege Escalation (achieved)
     - Code injection into a process (Notepad.exe)
     - The question asks for the next likely ATT&CK tactic involving techniques such as process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process to bypass detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While collection is a crucial part of the attack lifecycle, the techniques mentioned (process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process) are more closely related to evading detection rather than collecting information.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic has already been achieved, as mentioned in the question. The question asks for the next likely tactic after privilege escalation.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control server. While code injection could be part of establishing C2, the specific focus on bypassing detection through process hollowing and injecting code into a suspended process suggests a different primary goal.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection and bypass security controls. Process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process are both techniques specifically designed to hide malicious code and evade detection, fitting well within this tactic.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where an attacker has escalated privileges and injected code into a process.
   - The next step in the attack sequence, given the techniques of process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process, is most likely aimed at evading detection.
   - These techniques are characteristic of the Defense Evasion tactic, which is focused on avoiding detection by security systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after achieving privilege escalation and injecting code into Notepad.exe would involve techniques to evade detection.

Final Answer: D
