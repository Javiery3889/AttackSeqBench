To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already used a customized version of Mimikatz. Mimikatz is a tool known for extracting credentials from Windows systems, which aligns with the tactic of **Credential Access**. However, the question asks about the next step after credential gathering and validation of persistence mechanisms, focusing on establishing communication and executing further actions via DNS exchange queries with a Command and Control (C&C) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence mentioned involves:
   - Gathering credential information (likely using Mimikatz).
   - Validating scheduled tasks for persistence.
   - Establishing communication with a C&C server via DNS queries for further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While discovery is a crucial part of the attack lifecycle, the question specifically mentions actions taken after initial credential access and persistence, focusing on communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This involves gaining higher privileges on a system. Although privilege escalation might be necessary for certain actions, the question emphasizes communication with a C&C server, not the act of escalating privileges.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C&C server to issue commands and receive stolen data. The use of DNS queries to communicate with a C&C server directly aligns with this tactic.
   - **D: Credential Access**: While credential access has already been achieved (as indicated by the use of Mimikatz), the question asks about the next step involving communication with a C&C server, not further credential access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained credential information and validated persistence mechanisms.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, as described, involves communicating with a C&C server to execute further actions.
   - The use of DNS exchange queries for this communication is a method commonly associated with Command and Control, as it allows for stealthy and potentially encrypted communication between the compromised host and the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C**
