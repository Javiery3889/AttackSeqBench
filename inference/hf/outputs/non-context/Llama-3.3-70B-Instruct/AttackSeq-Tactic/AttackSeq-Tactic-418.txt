To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access.
   - It asks for the ATT&CK tactic most likely involved before this exploitation, specifically for scanning and collecting information on vulnerable hosts.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The sequence involves scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information about exposed and misconfigured Docker API instances before exploiting them for initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations, which doesn't directly relate to scanning for vulnerabilities.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which comes after initial access, not before.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system or network, which is what exploiting the misconfigured Docker API ports achieves, not the step before.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about a target system or network, which aligns with scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information about exposed instances.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that precedes the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access.
   - Scanning for vulnerabilities and collecting information about potential targets is a precursor to exploiting those vulnerabilities.
   - The ATT&CK framework defines Reconnaissance as the tactic that involves gathering information about the target, which includes scanning for vulnerabilities.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access involves scanning and information gathering, which aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic.

Final Answer: D
