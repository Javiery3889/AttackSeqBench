To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions the Pierogi backdoor, which is a type of malware, and its actions after the Discovery phase. Specifically, it talks about the backdoor collecting system information, taking screenshots, and executing arbitrary commands.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves an initial Discovery phase, followed by actions that include taking screenshots and executing commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery (B)** is mentioned in the question as the phase that has already occurred, where the backdoor collected system information. This is not what we're looking for since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this phase.
   - **Command and Control (A)** is a tactic that involves establishing and maintaining a communication channel with compromised systems to issue commands. The execution of arbitrary commands by the backdoor fits within this tactic, as it implies the backdoor is being controlled remotely to perform specific actions.
   - **Resource Development (C)** involves the establishment and/or compromise of infrastructure that can be used for future operations. While taking screenshots and executing commands could potentially contribute to resource development, this doesn't directly align with the immediate actions described.
   - **Collection (D)** is a tactic that involves gathering information that can be used to support targeting. Taking screenshots can be considered a form of collection, as it gathers visual information about the system or its activities. However, executing arbitrary commands is more closely related to controlling the system rather than just collecting information.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Discovery phase, given the backdoor's actions.
   - The actions described (taking screenshots and executing arbitrary commands) suggest a level of control and information gathering beyond mere discovery.
   - While **Collection (D)** could apply to the screenshot aspect, the execution of arbitrary commands more strongly suggests **Command and Control (A)**, as this tactic encompasses the ability to issue commands to a compromised system.
   - Therefore, considering the backdoor's capability to execute arbitrary commands as a primary indicator of remote control, the most appropriate answer is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: A
