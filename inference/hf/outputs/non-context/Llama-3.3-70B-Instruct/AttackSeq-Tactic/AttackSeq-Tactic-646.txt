To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between delivering Gh0st RAT via email and employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Delivering Gh0st RAT via email**: This action is typically associated with the "Initial Access" tactic. The attacker is attempting to gain initial access to the victim's system by sending a malicious email that delivers the Gh0st Remote Access Tool (RAT). The Gh0st RAT is a type of malware that allows attackers to remotely control the infected computer.

2. **Employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL**: This action falls under the "Execution" tactic, as it involves executing malicious code on the victim's system. DLL side-loading is a technique where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL, allowing the attacker to execute their code under the context of the legitimate application.

Given these two actions, we are looking for a tactic that logically fits between them in an attack sequence. The sequence so far involves gaining access (Initial Access) and then executing malicious code (Execution).

- **Initial Access (A)**: This is the tactic involved in the first step (delivering Gh0st RAT via email), so it's not what we're looking for as the "in-between" tactic.
- **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic involves the attacker developing resources, such as creating or obtaining malware, that can be used in the attack. While resource development is crucial for an attack, it doesn't directly fit as a sequential step between initial access and execution in this context, as it's more about preparation.
- **Execution (C)**: This is the tactic involved in the second step (employing DLL side-loading techniques), so it's also not the "in-between" tactic we're looking for.
- **Lateral Movement (D)**: This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional resources. However, the actions described (delivering malware via email and executing malicious code via DLL side-loading) don't necessarily imply movement within a network but rather focus on gaining access and executing code on a system.

Considering the sequence and the tactics provided, the most logical choice that fits between gaining initial access and executing malicious code (in this specific context of delivering malware and then using a technique like DLL side-loading) would actually be **Execution (C)**, as it directly follows the initial access in terms of the attack lifecycle. The initial access provides the means for the malware to be delivered, and then the execution tactic is used to run the malicious code (in this case, loading a malicious DLL). However, based on the question's phrasing, it seems to be looking for a step that occurs after initial access but before the specific execution technique mentioned (DLL side-loading).

Given the context and the steps outlined, the question seems to be slightly misinterpreted in the analysis above because the correct sequence should consider what happens after the initial access (delivering Gh0st RAT) and before the specific execution method (DLL side-loading) is employed. In a typical attack sequence, after initial access, an attacker might engage in **Execution** to run their tools or malware, which could include the Gh0st RAT. The use of DLL side-loading as described would also be a form of execution but is more specific. 

However, considering standard attack sequences and the tactics provided:
- The initial access delivers the malware.
- The execution of the malware (which could be considered part of the initial steps after access) leads to the system being compromised.
- The specific technique of DLL side-loading is a method of execution.

Thus, the question's framing seems to imply looking for a step that logically follows initial access and precedes the specific execution technique of DLL side-loading, which might not perfectly align with the standard sequence of tactics as defined by ATT&CK. 

Given the standard interpretation of ATT&CK tactics and the sequence provided:
- Initial Access is about getting into the system.
- Execution is about running the malicious code.

The question seems to be probing for understanding of the sequence of actions in an attack, but based on standard ATT&CK tactics, **Execution (C)** is the closest fit for what happens after initial access and involves running malicious code, which would include the use of Gh0st RAT and setting up for further malicious activities like DLL side-loading.

**Final Answer: C**
