To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks by exploiting external servers and deploying web shells. This indicates that the initial phase of the attack involved gaining access to the network, likely through vulnerabilities in external-facing systems.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactic of establishing a foothold typically follows the initial access phase, where attackers gain their first entry point into the network. The use of exploited external servers and deployment of web shells as a gateway suggests that the attackers first needed to gain access to these external servers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before initiating an attack. While reconnaissance is a crucial initial step in many attack sequences, it is not directly related to the action of establishing a foothold but rather precedes it.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is used by attackers to avoid detection within the network. It is more relevant after the initial access has been gained and the attacker is trying to maintain their presence without being detected.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving through a network to gain access to more systems or data. Lateral movement typically occurs after an attacker has established an initial foothold.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining an initial entry point into the network. Given that FIN13 used exploited external servers and deployed web shells, this suggests that the initial access was gained through these means, making it the most likely tactic to have occurred before establishing a foothold.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes actions (exploiting external servers and deploying web shells) that are typical of gaining initial access to a network.
   - Establishing a foothold is a step that follows initial access, where the attacker secures their position within the network.
   - Among the provided options, the one that directly precedes the actions described (establishing a foothold) and is most closely related to the method of exploiting external servers and deploying web shells is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: D**
