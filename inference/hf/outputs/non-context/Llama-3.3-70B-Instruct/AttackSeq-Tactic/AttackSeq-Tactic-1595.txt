To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through spear phishing but before the infected device exhibited persistent C2 (Command and Control) beaconing to maintain access, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Infiltration**: The attack starts with spear phishing, which is a social engineering technique used to gain initial access to a network or system. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Post-Infiltration Actions**: After gaining initial access, an attacker typically seeks to establish a foothold, which may involve setting up a persistent connection back to their command and control servers. However, before establishing this persistent C2 connection, the attacker might need to perform certain actions to ensure the longevity and stealth of their access.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to evade detection and prevent their malware from being analyzed. While defense evasion is crucial throughout the attack lifecycle, it is not the primary goal immediately after initial access but before establishing a C2 channel.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network to expand access. Lateral movement could occur after initial access and before establishing a persistent C2 connection, but it's not the most direct next step in terms of setting up a C2 channel.
   - **C: Discovery**: After gaining initial access, an attacker often seeks to understand the network layout, identify valuable targets, and gather information necessary for further actions. Discovery is a critical phase that likely occurs after initial access and before the attacker establishes a persistent C2 connection, as it helps in planning the next steps, including where to move laterally and how to maintain access without being detected.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic involves actions taken by an adversary to disrupt, corrupt, or destroy systems and data. Impact is typically one of the later stages of an attack, after the attacker has established access, gathered necessary information, and decided on the objectives of their attack.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible next step after initial access (through spear phishing) but before establishing a persistent C2 connection would be for the attacker to perform **discovery** actions. This is because understanding the network, identifying potential targets, and gathering information are essential steps that help in planning the subsequent actions, including how to maintain access (through C2 beaconing) without being detected.

**Final Answer: C**
