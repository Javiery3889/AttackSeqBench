To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors into tactics.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where RIG Exploit Kit (EK) gains initial access through malvertising. This means the attackers are using malicious advertisements to redirect users to compromised websites or pages that have exploit kit JavaScript injected, which then exploits vulnerabilities in the user's browser or plugins to gain access to the system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP (Tactic, Technique, Procedure) here is "Initial Access" through "Exploit Public-Facing Application" (which would include exploit kits like RIG EK). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **before** this initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining resources, such as exploit kits, that can be used for future operations. Given that the scenario involves the use of RIG EK, it's plausible that before using this exploit kit for initial access, the attackers had to develop or acquire it.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that is actually described in the scenario, not what happened before.
   - **C: Exfiltration**: This involves the adversary stealing data, which would typically happen after initial access has been gained, not before.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic refers to the adversary's actions to disrupt, manipulate, or destroy data or systems, which also would occur after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the initial access via RIG EK.
   - Initial access is the point at which the attacker first enters the network, so we're looking for something that precedes this.
   - Resource development could include acquiring or developing the tools (like RIG EK) needed for the attack, which logically precedes using those tools for initial access.
   - The other options (Initial Access, Exfiltration, Impact) all occur at or after the point of initial access.

**Final Answer: A**
