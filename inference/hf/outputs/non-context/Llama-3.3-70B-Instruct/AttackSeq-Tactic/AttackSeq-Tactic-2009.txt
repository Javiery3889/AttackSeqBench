To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers send spear phishing emails disguised as payment documents to achieve initial access. The emails contain compressed files with malware executables.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves sending targeted emails (spear phishing) as a method to gain initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a victim's system. While execution of malware is part of the attack, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before achieving initial access through spear phishing.
   - **Reconnaissance (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. Sending targeted emails disguised as payment documents suggests that the attackers have some knowledge about their targets, such as their financial operations or interests, which could have been gathered through reconnaissance.
   - **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations, such as setting up command and control servers. While resource development is crucial for an attack, the question focuses on the actions leading up to the initial access via spear phishing.
   - **Persistence (D)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to a system or network after initial access has been achieved. The question asks about the tactic before initial access, not after.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers sent targeted emails, which implies they had some prior knowledge about their targets.
   - This prior knowledge likely came from gathering information about the targets, which aligns with the **Reconnaissance** tactic.
   - The other options do not fit as well with the actions described before achieving initial access through spear phishing.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs given the context of the question points towards the attackers first conducting reconnaissance to gather information about their targets before sending targeted spear phishing emails.

Final Answer: B
