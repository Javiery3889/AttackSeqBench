To determine the most likely next ATT&CK tactic after Korplug collects extensive system information and data, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Analysis of the Situation**: Korplug has already collected extensive system information and data. This action suggests that the initial access to the system has been achieved, and some level of reconnaissance has been performed. The collection of data from various drives indicates a focus on gathering sensitive information.

2. **Understanding Korplug's Actions**: The fact that Korplug communicates with fallback servers using encrypted TCP-based protocols implies a need for command and control (C2) communications. This is a common method used by malware or attackers to maintain control over compromised systems, receive updates, or send stolen data back to the attackers.

3. **Evaluating ATT&CK Tactics**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server. Given that Korplug is communicating with fallback servers, this aligns well with the Command and Control tactic, as it typically involves the use of encrypted protocols for stealthy communication.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic is about gaining an initial foothold into a network. Since Korplug is already collecting data and communicating with servers, initial access has likely already been achieved.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)**: This involves moving from one system to another within a network. While possible, the information provided does not directly indicate movement between systems; it focuses more on data collection and communication with external servers.
   - **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves transferring data from the compromised system to the attacker. While data collection is mentioned, the primary focus of the question is on the communication method used by Korplug, which suggests a broader purpose than just data exfiltration.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that Korplug is communicating with fallback servers using encrypted TCP-based protocols after collecting system information, the most likely next ATT&CK tactic is related to maintaining control and potentially receiving further instructions or sending collected data. This scenario best aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
