To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after establishing persistence and before gathering detailed system information, let's analyze the given sequence of events and the provided answer choices.

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The attackers have already established persistence through a scheduled task named 'Windows Update'. This indicates they have a foothold in the system and can maintain access over time. The tactic of establishing persistence is about maintaining a presence within the system.

2. **Gathering Detailed System Information**: Before this step, the attackers need to understand the environment they are operating in. This involves gathering information about the system, such as hostname, OS version, and potentially other details that could be useful for further exploitation or movement within the network.

Given these two points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another within the network. While it's possible that after establishing persistence, the attackers might attempt lateral movement, this action typically follows or is concurrent with gathering more information about the network and its systems.

- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or organization. Given that the attackers are looking to gather detailed system information (like hostname and OS version), the Discovery tactic aligns closely with the next logical step after establishing persistence. It makes sense for attackers to learn more about the system they've compromised before deciding on their next actions, such as lateral movement or further exploitation.

- **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is about evading detection by the system's defenses. While defense evasion is a crucial aspect of maintaining access and could be ongoing throughout the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of establishing persistence and then gathering system information.

- **D: Persistence**: The question states that persistence has already been established, so this option doesn't fit as the next step in the sequence.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after establishing persistence, the attackers would likely engage in **Discovery** to gather more information about the system before proceeding with other tactics like lateral movement or further exploitation.

Final Answer: B
