To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions that Iron Tiger gained access to the Mimi chat developer's backend and compromised its servers through a supply chain attack. This indicates an initial breach has occurred.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) starts with gaining access, which is typically categorized under "Initial Access" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Access (C)**: This is the tactic involved in gaining an initial foothold within a network. Given that Iron Tiger has already compromised the servers, this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used to support operations. While possible after initial access, it's not the most direct next step after gaining access through a supply chain attack.
   - **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves removing data from the target system. After gaining access, especially through a supply chain attack, exfiltrating sensitive data could be a logical next step for an adversary like Iron Tiger.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves evading detection by the target's defensive systems. While defense evasion techniques are likely used throughout an attack, the question seems to be asking for a tactic that follows the initial access in a more sequential manner, focusing on the objectives of the attack rather than the methods to avoid detection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial action - Iron Tiger has already gained access through a supply chain attack.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the likely next objective - After gaining access, especially in a scenario where sensitive data is likely available (such as in a chat application's backend), the next logical step would be to exfiltrate valuable data.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the options - Given the context, **Exfiltration (B)** is the most plausible next tactic after gaining access, as it aligns with a common objective of such attacks: stealing sensitive information.

Final Answer: B
