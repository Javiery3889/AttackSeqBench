To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the Chinese APT actors deployed a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute their malware payload, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute malware payload. This action is related to executing malicious code on a victim's system. According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, "Execution" (Tactic ID: TA0002) involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique mentioned (DLL sideloading) falls under the "Execution" tactic, specifically under the technique "Dynamic Link Library Search Order Hijacking" or similar techniques related to executing code. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **before** this execution.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the victim. It is unlikely to occur before the initial deployment of malware.
   - **B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. While collection can happen at various stages, including before initial access, it's not directly related to the action of deploying malware.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. Deploying a dropper executable via DLL sideloading implies that the attackers already have some level of access to the system, making "Initial Access" a likely precursor to the described action.
   - **D: Execution**: This is the tactic that includes the technique described in the question. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the execution of the malware payload.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading is an execution technique.
   - For this technique to be successful, the attackers must have already gained access to the system.
   - Therefore, the most logical precursor to executing malware in this manner is gaining "Initial Access" to the system.

**Final Answer: C**
