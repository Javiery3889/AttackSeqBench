To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The malware gained initial access to the logistics/shipping company's system through a compromised proprietary hardware/software scanner application. This indicates the first step in the attack sequence where the attacker gains entry into the target system.

2. **Identifying Financial Servers**: The malware then began identifying financial servers via automated attacks using SMB (Server Message Block) and RADMIN (Remote Administrator) protocols. This action suggests that the attacker is trying to discover valuable targets within the network, specifically financial servers, which could be used for further malicious activities such as data theft or ransomware attacks.

Given these steps, we need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the malware began identifying financial servers. Let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Impact**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions to manipulate, disrupt, or destroy data or systems. Identifying financial servers is more about discovery than causing impact, so this doesn't seem to be the immediate precursor to identifying financial servers.

- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling the malware and sending commands to it. While command and control is crucial for the operation of the malware, the question focuses on the action of identifying financial servers, which suggests a step beyond just establishing control.

- **C: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the system. While persistence is important for long-term access, the action described (identifying financial servers) is more aligned with exploring the network rather than ensuring continued access.

- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions to gain knowledge about the system, network, or organization. Identifying financial servers via automated attacks using SMB and RADMIN protocols directly aligns with the discovery tactic, as the attacker is trying to learn more about the network's layout and valuable assets.

However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the malware began identifying financial servers. Given that discovery is the tactic that involves identifying financial servers, we need to consider what would logically precede this action in terms of ATT&CK tactics.

The most logical precursor to discovery, especially in the context of identifying specific servers within a network, would be establishing a means to control the malware and receive information back, which is **Command and Control (B)**. This is because, to effectively discover and identify financial servers, the attacker would need to have a mechanism in place to issue commands to the malware and receive feedback or results from those commands.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access was gained through a compromised application.
2. The next logical step for the attacker would be to establish a means of controlling the malware.
3. With control established, the malware can then be used to discover the network, including identifying financial servers.

**Final Answer: B**
