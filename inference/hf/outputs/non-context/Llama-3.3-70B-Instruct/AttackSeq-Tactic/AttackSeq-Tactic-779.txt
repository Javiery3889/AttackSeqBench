To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions the execution of a PowerShell loader via an Internet Explorer exploit vector. This indicates an initial access vector where the attackers used a vulnerability in Internet Explorer to execute malicious code.
   - It then mentions the use of an LPE (Local Privilege Escalation) binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458 to gain system privileges. This is a clear indication of a privilege escalation attempt, where the attackers aim to increase their privileges from a standard user to a more privileged user, such as an administrator.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial exploitation of Internet Explorer to execute a PowerShell loader falls under "Execution" (TACTIC ID: TA0002) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as it involves executing malicious code on the victim's system.
   - The use of an LPE binary to exploit CVE-2019-1458 for gaining system privileges directly relates to "Privilege Escalation" (TACTIC ID: TA0004), as the goal is to elevate the privileges of the attacker's code or user account.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This is what the attackers achieved by using the LPE binary, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** this action.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This involves moving from one system to another within the network, which is not directly indicated in the provided sequence.
   - **C: Execution** - Given that the PowerShell loader was executed via an Internet Explorer exploit, this is the most likely tactic to have occurred before the privilege escalation, as it involves running the attacker's code on the victim system.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control server, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence starts with exploiting Internet Explorer to execute a PowerShell loader, which aligns with the "Execution" tactic.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the attackers used an LPE binary for privilege escalation.
   - Given the information, "Execution" is the tactic that directly precedes the described privilege escalation attempt, as it involves the initial execution of malicious code on the system.

Final Answer: C
