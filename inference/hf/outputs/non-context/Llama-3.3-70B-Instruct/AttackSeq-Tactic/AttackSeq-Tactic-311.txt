To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with establishing initial access through email attachments containing malicious VBA macros. This is a clear example of the "Initial Access" tactic, specifically the "Phishing" technique (T1566) or "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1566.001), where malicious attachments are used to gain access to a system.

2. **Execution**: After the initial access, for the Sednit's Delphi downloader to execute and send gathered information, there must be an execution phase. The use of `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST` indicates that the attacker is executing system commands to gather information. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic, where an adversary executes malicious code on a compromised system. The specific technique here could be "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1059), where command-line interfaces like `cmd.exe` are used to execute commands.

3. **Reconnaissance**: The command `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST` is used to gather system information and list running tasks, respectively. This action is part of the "Reconnaissance" tactic, as the adversary is gathering information about the system and its environment. Specifically, this could be related to "System Information Discovery" (T1082) and "Process Discovery" (T1057).

Given the sequence of events:
- Initial access is gained.
- The Sednit's Delphi downloader is executed.
- System information and task lists are gathered and sent to a C&C server.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Sednit's Delphi downloader sent gathered information to a C&C server. Since the execution of the downloader and the gathering of system information are closely related and essentially happen in sequence after initial access, the tactic that most likely occurred before sending the information (and thus, after initial access but before or as part of the execution that leads to sending information) is the "Execution" tactic. This is because the execution of the malicious code (in this case, the Delphi downloader and the system commands) is a prerequisite for the gathering and sending of system information.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Identify the initial access method: Email attachments with malicious VBA macros.
2. Determine the action of the Sednit's Delphi downloader: Execution of system commands to gather information.
3. Relate the gathering of system information to the appropriate ATT&CK tactic: Reconnaissance.
4. Since the question asks for the tactic before sending information to the C&C server, consider what must happen for this sending to occur: The malicious code must be executed.

**Final Answer: C**
