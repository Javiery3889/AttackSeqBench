To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the iOS malware was installed on already compromised systems but before it started gathering information, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Installation of Malware**: The malware has already been installed on the compromised systems. This implies that the initial access and execution phases have been completed.

2. **Gathering Information**: The next step mentioned is the malware gathering information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. This action corresponds to the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gathering information that can be used for future operations or to fulfill the adversary's intelligence requirements.

Given these points, we need to identify which tactic would logically occur between the installation of malware and the collection of sensitive information.

- **A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. While execution is necessary for the malware to run, the question implies that the malware is already installed and running, so this is not the best fit for what happens "after" installation but "before" data collection.

- **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control servers or creating additional malware. While resource development could occur at various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly fit the sequence described, as it's more about preparing for future actions rather than a direct precursor to collecting information.

- **C: Command and Control**: Establishing command and control (C2) is crucial for the adversary to communicate with the compromised system, send commands, and receive stolen data. This would logically occur after the malware is installed (to control the malware) and before the collection of information (as a means to receive the collected data).

- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gain knowledge about the system, network, or organization. While discovery is indeed about gathering information, the specific actions mentioned (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) seem more targeted and suggest that the malware is already in a position to collect specific data, implying that some level of discovery or setup has already occurred.

Considering these points, the most plausible sequence suggests that after the malware is installed, the adversary would need to establish a means to control the malware and receive the data it collects. Thus, the tactic that most likely occurred after the installation of the malware but before it started gathering information is related to setting up the communication channel between the compromised system and the adversary.

Final Answer: C
