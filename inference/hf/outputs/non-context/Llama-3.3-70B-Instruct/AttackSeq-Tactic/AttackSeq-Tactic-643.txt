To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after GreyEnergy operators gained credential access and before they established internal C&C proxies, let's analyze the sequence of events and the tactics involved.

1. **Initial Condition**: GreyEnergy operators have already gained credential access using tools like Mimikatz. This means they have obtained login credentials, which is a part of the "Credential Access" tactic.

2. **Objective**: The next step mentioned is the establishment of internal C&C (Command and Control) proxies. This implies the attackers are looking to maintain control over the compromised network and possibly expand their reach within it.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**: After gaining initial access, attackers often seek to escalate their privileges to gain more control over the system or network. This could be a logical step after gaining credential access, as higher privileges could facilitate the establishment of C&C proxies.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This is the objective mentioned after the initial condition (gaining credential access), but the question asks for the tactic that occurred before establishing C&C proxies. Thus, while C&C is the ultimate goal, it's not the step immediately before establishing internal proxies.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another within the network. While lateral movement could be a part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly precede the establishment of internal C&C proxies as a necessary step. Lateral movement might occur after gaining higher privileges or as part of expanding the attack scope.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This has already been achieved, as per the initial condition. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after this point.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining credential access and before establishing internal C&C proxies is **Privilege Escalation**. This is because gaining higher privileges would provide the attackers with the necessary access and control to set up internal C&C proxies effectively.

Final Answer: A
