To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial compromise but before the Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction, let's break down the sequence of events and the tactics involved:

1. **Initial Compromise**: The Duke group initiated their campaign using 'Office Monkeys'- and 'eFax'-themed emails to deliver Trojan.Cozer. This action is aimed at gaining initial access to the network, which aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic.

2. **Post-Compromise Actions**: After gaining initial access, the next steps typically involve establishing a foothold, escalating privileges, and gathering information about the network. The question mentions actions that occurred before the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks (which is a form of "Credential Access" and "Lateral Movement") and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server (which could be part of "Collection" or "Exfiltration").

Given the options and the context:
- **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques used to obtain credentials, which could be a step after initial access but before the mentioned Kerberos attacks. However, the question specifies that the Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks happened after the tactic in question, suggesting that credential access is not the best fit because the Kerberos attack is itself a method of credential access.
  
- **B: Exfiltration**: This involves the removal of data from the target system, which seems to be what happened after the mentioned tactic since email extraction is a form of data exfiltration. However, exfiltration typically occurs after data has been collected or after the attackers have gained sufficient access to the desired data.

- **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection, which can occur at any point during the attack. While defense evasion is crucial for maintaining access, it doesn't directly lead to the actions described (Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction) in a linear sequence.

- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, systems, and applications. After initial access, discovery is a logical next step to understand the network layout, identify potential targets (like the MS Exchange Server), and find opportunities for lateral movement or privilege escalation, which would precede the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction.

Considering the sequence of events and the tactics involved, the most plausible sequence suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers would likely engage in **discovery** to understand the network and identify targets before using specific techniques like Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for lateral movement and credential access, and extracting emails.

Final Answer: D
