To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after UNC2452 evaded detection and before they moved laterally through the network, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: 
   - The question mentions that UNC2452 used techniques like Masquerading (T1036) and Subvert Trust Controls (T1553) to evade detection. 
   - These techniques are typically used to avoid being detected by security controls, which suggests that the attackers were already inside the network.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after evasion and before lateral movement.

2. **Understanding the Techniques and Tactics**:
   - **Masquerading (T1036)** and **Subvert Trust Controls (T1553)** are techniques used to evade detection and maintain access, often by disguising as legitimate processes or users, or by manipulating trust mechanisms within the system.
   - **Lateral Movement** is the tactic of moving through a network to expand access, often to specific targets or to increase control.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the network, systems, and applications to understand the environment. After evading detection, an attacker would likely want to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and find ways to move laterally. Discovery would logically precede lateral movement as it helps in identifying paths and targets for lateral movement.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This is the act of moving through the network, which the question states happens after the tactic we are trying to identify.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining an initial foothold in the network, which would have occurred before the evasion techniques were used.
   - **D: Command and Control**: Establishing command and control is crucial for an attacker to issue commands to compromised systems, but it doesn't necessarily fit as the immediate step before lateral movement in the context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   1. The attackers used evasion techniques, indicating they were already inside the network.
   2. Before moving laterally, it would be beneficial for the attackers to gather information about the network.
   3. Discovery (A) is the tactic that aligns with gathering this necessary information.

**Final Answer: A**
