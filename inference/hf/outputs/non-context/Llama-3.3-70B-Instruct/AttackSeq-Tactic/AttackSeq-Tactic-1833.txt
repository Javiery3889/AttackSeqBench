To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already compromised hotel systems, captured credentials, and enabled remote access. The goal now is to gather credit card data by monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that best fits this next step in the attack sequence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve:
   - Compromising systems and capturing credentials (already done).
   - Enabling remote access (already done).
   - The next step involves monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer to gather credit card data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While it's a crucial part of the attack lifecycle, it doesn't directly involve gathering sensitive data like credit card numbers from clipboards or print jobs.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the compromised system. Enabling remote access is a form of persistence, but the question asks about the next step after gaining access, which is focused on data collection.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering sensitive data. Monitoring the clipboard for credit card numbers and intercepting documents sent to the printer directly aligns with collecting sensitive information, making it a strong candidate.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This tactic is about obtaining credentials. Since the question states that credentials have already been captured, this option doesn't fit the next step in the sequence described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained access and wants to gather specific data (credit card details).
   - The methods described (monitoring the clipboard and printer documents) are used for collecting sensitive information.
   - Therefore, the tactic that best aligns with these actions is focused on collecting data.

**Final Answer: C**
