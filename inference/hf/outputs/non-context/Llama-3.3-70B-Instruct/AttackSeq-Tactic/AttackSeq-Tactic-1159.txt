To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the options step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions that FastPOS, a type of malware, has already employed keylogging and RAM scraping. These techniques are used to steal sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and their associated data. The question specifically asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to ensure the immediate transmission of stolen credit card data, focusing on cards with valid service codes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned (keylogging and RAM scraping) fall under the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as they are methods used to gather sensitive information. However, the question asks for the tactic that follows the collection of this data, specifically for the transmission of the stolen data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Collection**: This is the tactic that involves gathering information. While keylogging and RAM scraping are part of collection, the question asks for the tactic that ensures the "immediate transmission" of the stolen data, which implies a step after collection.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gain knowledge about the system or network. It doesn't directly relate to the transmission of stolen data.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing a channel for controlling the malware and potentially exfiltrating data. Given that the malware has already collected sensitive information, the next logical step would be to transmit this data back to the attackers, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic is about how the adversary first gains access to the system. Since the malware is already operational (as it has collected data), initial access has already been achieved.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has collected sensitive data through keylogging and RAM scraping.
   - The next step in the attack sequence, given the data has been collected, would be to transmit this data back to the attackers.
   - The Command and Control tactic is the most relevant to this step as it involves the communication channel used by the malware to send the stolen data to the attackers.

**Final Answer: C**
