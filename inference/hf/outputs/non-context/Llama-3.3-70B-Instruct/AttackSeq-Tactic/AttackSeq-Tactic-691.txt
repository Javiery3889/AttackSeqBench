To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already performed defense evasion techniques. This implies the attacker is inside the network or on a host and is trying to avoid detection. After evasion, the attacker needs to gather information about the host before establishing communication with a Command and Control (C2) server using DNS tunneling.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence mentioned involves:
   - Defense evasion techniques (to avoid detection).
   - Gathering host information.
   - Establishing communication with a C2 server via DNS tunneling.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While it's a possible step in an attack, it doesn't directly relate to gathering host information before C2 communication.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or environment. It aligns with the need to gather host information before establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic is about executing malicious code on a host. While execution might be necessary for the backdoor to run, it doesn't directly involve gathering host information.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: The question already states that defense evasion has occurred, so this is not the next step but a preceding action.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already evaded defenses, indicating they are past the initial intrusion phase.
   - Before a backdoor can effectively communicate with a C2 server, especially through a method like DNS tunneling which might require specific configurations or information about the host's network environment, the attacker needs to gather information about the host.
   - The tactic that directly involves gathering this kind of information is **Discovery**.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the need to gather host information before establishing communication with the C2 server, the most plausible sequence of TTPs points towards the **Discovery** tactic as the next step after defense evasion and before the backdoor's communication setup.

Final Answer: B
