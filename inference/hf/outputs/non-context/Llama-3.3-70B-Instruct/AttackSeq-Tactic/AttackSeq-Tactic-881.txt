To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gathered network information using tools like ADFind (a tool for querying Active Directory) and port scanning. 
   - The next step mentioned is the propagation of beacons to other systems within the company's network. 
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves reconnaissance (gathering network information) followed by an action that suggests spreading or moving laterally within the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. While the initial steps (using ADFind and port scanning) align with Discovery, the propagation of beacons to other systems suggests a move beyond just discovering information.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic is about executing malicious code on a target system. While execution is a critical step in many attacks, the specific action of propagating beacons doesn't directly imply the execution of code on multiple systems but rather setting up a means for potential future command and control (C2) or further malicious activity.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection. Propagating beacons could be part of evading defenses, but it more directly implies movement or expansion within the network rather than solely evading defenses.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. Propagating beacons to other systems fits well with this tactic, as it suggests establishing a presence on multiple systems, potentially for further exploitation or to use those systems as a foothold for additional malicious activities.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial steps of using ADFind and port scanning are about gathering information, which is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - However, the question asks about the tactic that "most likely occurred next" after these initial steps, specifically when attackers propagated beacons to other systems.
   - Propagating beacons to other systems within the network is most closely associated with establishing a broader presence within the network, which aligns with the definition of Lateral Movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after the initial discovery phase, the attackers engaged in Lateral Movement by propagating beacons.

Final Answer: D
