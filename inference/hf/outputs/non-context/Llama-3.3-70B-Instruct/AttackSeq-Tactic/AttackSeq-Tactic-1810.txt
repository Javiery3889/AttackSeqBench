To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already collected credentials and are now setting up a mechanism to upload these stolen credentials to an external FTP server. The key elements here are the collection of credentials and the establishment of a method for exfiltrating this data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - Collecting credentials (which has already happened).
   - Preparing them for transmission.
   - Establishing a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control servers or acquiring exploit tools. While uploading credentials could be seen as part of resource development for future operations, it's more directly related to exfiltrating data.
   - **B: Collection**: This tactic is about gathering information that can be used for operations. The collection of credentials itself fits this tactic, but the act of uploading them to an external server is more about exfiltration than collection.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This involves gathering information about the target environment. Uploading credentials to an external server doesn't directly fit this tactic as it's more about data exfiltration than gathering new information about the target.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication channels to control compromised systems or exfiltrate data. Setting up a mechanism to upload stolen credentials to an external FTP server aligns closely with establishing a command and control channel for data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the action of uploading stolen credentials to an external server, which implies data exfiltration.
   - Data exfiltration is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic, as it involves communicating with external systems (in this case, an FTP server) to transfer stolen data.
   - While Resource Development could be a related tactic if the exfiltrated data is used to develop resources for future attacks, the immediate action described (uploading credentials) is more directly related to Command and Control.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the focus on establishing a mechanism for uploading stolen credentials to an external server, which is a form of data exfiltration and communication with an external system, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is Command and Control.

Final Answer: D
