To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions Vyveva establishing persistence by creating a new service for its loader. After this step, it aims to obtain system information such as OS version and architecture. The ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the choices are Persistence, Defense Evasion, Reconnaissance, and Discovery.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - **Persistence** is the tactic of maintaining access to a system or network.
   - **Defense Evasion** involves techniques to evade detection.
   - **Reconnaissance** is about gathering information about the target environment prior to an attack.
   - **Discovery** involves gaining knowledge about the system, network, or organization after initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Persistence (A)** is mentioned in the question itself as something Vyveva has already achieved by creating a new service for its loader. Therefore, it's not what happens before obtaining system information in this context.
   - **Defense Evasion (B)** could be a tactic used at various stages of an attack but isn't directly related to gathering system information.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)** typically occurs before the initial access to a system, which doesn't fit the timeline given that Vyveva has already established persistence.
   - **Discovery (D)** is the most likely tactic to occur after establishing persistence and before or as part of obtaining specific system information like OS version and architecture. This is because discovery involves techniques used to gather information about the system, network, or environment after gaining access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Vyveva has established persistence, which means it has already gained access to the system.
   - The next logical step for an attacker after gaining persistence would be to gather more information about the system to plan further actions.
   - Obtaining system information such as OS version and architecture is a part of the discovery process, which helps in tailoring the attack or deciding on the next steps.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the sequence of events and the definitions of the ATT&CK tactics, the most plausible sequence is that after establishing persistence, the next tactic would be to gather more information about the system, which aligns with **Discovery**.

Final Answer: D
