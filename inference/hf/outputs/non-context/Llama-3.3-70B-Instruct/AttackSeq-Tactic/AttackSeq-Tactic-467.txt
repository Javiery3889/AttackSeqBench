To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Gallmaker exploited the DDE protocol for remote code execution without leaving artifacts on disk and before establishing three primary IP addresses for their C&C infrastructure, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Exploitation of DDE Protocol for Remote Code Execution**: The initial step involves exploiting the DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol to achieve remote code execution. This action allows an attacker to run malicious code on a victim's system. This step aligns with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as it involves executing malicious code on a target system.

2. **No Artifacts Left on Disk**: The fact that no artifacts are left on disk suggests an effort to evade detection, which could imply the use of techniques under "Defense Evasion." However, the primary action described here is the exploitation and execution, not the evasion of detection methods.

3. **Establishing C&C Infrastructure**: Before establishing a Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure, an attacker would typically need to ensure they have a stable foothold in the network and possibly elevate their privileges to move laterally or to establish persistence. Establishing C&C infrastructure is directly related to the "Command and Control" tactic.

Given these steps, the sequence of events is:
- **Initial Exploitation and Execution**: The attacker exploits the DDE protocol for remote code execution, which aligns with "Execution."
- **Need for Persistence or Elevation**: Before setting up C&C, the attacker might need to ensure their access is stable, possibly through privilege escalation or defense evasion techniques.
- **Establishing C&C**: This is the final step mentioned, directly related to "Command and Control."

Considering the options provided and the sequence of events:
- **A: Execution** has already occurred as the initial step.
- **B: Command and Control** is what's being set up afterwards, so it's the outcome of the sequence, not the step in between.
- **C: Privilege Escalation** could be a necessary step after initial execution to ensure the attacker can perform actions required to establish a C&C infrastructure, but it's not directly implied by the question.
- **D: Defense Evasion** is relevant because exploiting a protocol without leaving artifacts on disk implies evasive techniques were used, and this could continue to be relevant as the attacker establishes their C&C infrastructure to avoid detection.

However, the question asks for the tactic most likely to occur **after** the exploitation and **before** establishing the C&C infrastructure. Given that the exploitation (Execution) has already happened, and the establishment of C&C is the next major step, the tactic that fits best in between these two, considering typical attack sequences, involves ensuring the attacker's actions remain undetected or preparing for further malicious activities. 

Since the exploitation has occurred, and the focus is on what happens before C&C establishment, the most relevant tactic that aligns with preparing for or supporting the establishment of C&C, without explicit mention of needing higher privileges (though it's a common step), would be ensuring the attacker's activities are not detected, which aligns with **Defense Evasion**. This is because the initial exploitation already achieved execution, and defense evasion techniques would be crucial in maintaining access without detection before setting up C&C channels.

**Final Answer: D**
