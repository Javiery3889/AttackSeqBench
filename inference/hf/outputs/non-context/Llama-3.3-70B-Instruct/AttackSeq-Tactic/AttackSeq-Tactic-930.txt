To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described actions, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The attacker decrypted obfuscated registry content using an AES256 Decryptor.
   - The attacker deployed the njRAT remote access tool.
   
   The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves decrypting hidden content and then deploying a remote access tool. The use of a decryptor to uncover hidden registry content suggests an attempt to uncover or utilize previously hidden information, possibly for malicious purposes. The deployment of njRAT, a known remote access tool (RAT), indicates an intention to establish control over the compromised system.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection and bypass security controls. While decrypting obfuscated content could be part of defense evasion, the deployment of a RAT like njRAT is more closely associated with establishing a persistent presence and control over a system.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command and control servers. Deploying a RAT like njRAT is a strong indicator of this tactic, as RATs are used to issue commands to the compromised system and receive data from it.
   - **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves the attacker developing resources, such as creating accounts or compromising additional systems, to support their operations. While deploying a RAT could be seen as developing resources, it's more directly related to maintaining access and control.
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic is about the initial entry point used by the attacker to gain access to a network or system. Deploying a RAT typically occurs after initial access has been achieved.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The deployment of njRAT indicates the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now looking to establish a persistent presence and control.
   - The action of decrypting obfuscated registry content could be part of setting up this persistence or preparing the system for further exploitation.
   - Given that njRAT is used for remote access and control, the most relevant ATT&CK tactic after its deployment would be related to maintaining communication and issuing commands to the compromised system.

**Final Answer: B**
