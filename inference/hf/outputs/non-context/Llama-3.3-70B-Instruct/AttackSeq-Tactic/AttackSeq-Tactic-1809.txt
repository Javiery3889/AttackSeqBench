To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the use of legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection, which implies a phase in an attack where the adversary is already inside the network and is trying to maintain access without being detected. The fact that they remained undetected for six months suggests a prolonged period of activity focused on gathering information or waiting for the right moment to act further.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The use of legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection is a technique often associated with the "Defense Evasion" technique (TA0005) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after this, given the context of remaining undetected for six months.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used to support operations, such as setting up command and control servers or acquiring exploits. While resource development could happen at any stage, it doesn't directly relate to the act of remaining undetected within a network.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing communication channels to control compromised systems within the target network. Using legitimate tools to avoid detection could be part of maintaining command and control, but the question implies we're looking for what happens after such techniques are successfully employed.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, systems, and applications. An adversary remaining undetected for six months likely spent time discovering the network layout, user behaviors, and potential vulnerabilities to exploit later.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic is focused on gathering sensitive information, which could be the ultimate goal after an adversary has established a foothold and remained undetected. However, collection might not necessarily be the immediate next step after avoiding detection, as the adversary might first need to understand the network better.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection suggests the adversary is past the initial access phase and is focused on persistence and evasion.
   - Remaining undetected for six months implies the adversary is in a phase where they are gathering information or waiting, rather than acting overtly.
   - Given the context, the most logical next step after successfully evading detection would be to **discover** more about the network, its vulnerabilities, and potential targets before deciding on the next course of action, such as collection or further exploitation.

**Final Answer: C**
