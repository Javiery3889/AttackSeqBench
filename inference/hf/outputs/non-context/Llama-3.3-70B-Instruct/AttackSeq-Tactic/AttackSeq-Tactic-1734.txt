To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the malware components collected detailed system information, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions that malware components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) have collected detailed system information. This includes IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings. The collection of such detailed information typically serves to gather intelligence about the target system and network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The action described (collecting system information) aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** this collection. 

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Exfiltration**: This involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. Given that the malware has collected detailed system information, the next logical step could be to exfiltrate this data back to the attackers, making it a plausible next step.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques used to maintain access to the system. While persistence is a common goal after initial access, it doesn't directly follow the collection of system information as a necessary next step.
   - **C: Collection**: The question states that collection has already occurred, so this cannot be the next step.
   - **D: Discovery**: Similar to Collection, Discovery is what has been described as happening before the question's timeframe, so it's not the next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has collected system information, which is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The next logical step for an attacker, after gathering valuable information, would be to exfiltrate this data to their command and control servers for further analysis or to use the information for future attacks.
   - Exfiltration directly follows the collection of sensitive data as it allows the attackers to utilize the gathered intelligence.

**Final Answer: A**
