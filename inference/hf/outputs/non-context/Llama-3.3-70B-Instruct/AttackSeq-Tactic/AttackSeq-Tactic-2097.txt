To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and other hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question mentions the use of a back door (Nidiran) and other hacktools to infect internal hosts. This implies that the attackers already have some level of access to the victim's network.

2. **Identifying the TTPs**: The use of a back door like Nidiran is associated with tactics that involve maintaining access or executing commands on a compromised system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** this action.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing code on a compromised system, which could be a part of using the Nidiran back door but doesn't necessarily precede its use in a logical attack sequence.
   - **B: Command and Control**: Establishing command and control (C2) is crucial for attackers to issue commands to compromised systems. While C2 is related to the use of back doors, it's more about the communication channel than the initial access or discovery phase.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold into a network. The use of a back door implies that initial access has already been achieved. Therefore, initial access would logically precede the use of tools like Nidiran.
   - **D: Discovery**: Discovery involves gathering information about the target environment. While discovery can happen at various stages of an attack, including after initial access to map out the internal network, it's less directly related to the action of using a back door compared to gaining initial access.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the use of a back door like Nidiran to infect internal hosts implies that the attackers already have access to the network, the most logical preceding tactic is gaining **Initial Access**. This is because before an attacker can use a back door or other hacktools to move laterally within a network, they must first gain entry into that network.

Final Answer: C
