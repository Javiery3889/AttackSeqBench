To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before StellarParticle established persistence, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that StellarParticle established persistence by leveraging credential hopping and configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) persistence. This indicates a stage in the attack where the adversary is already inside the network and is taking steps to maintain access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve establishing persistence, which is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The specific techniques mentioned are credential hopping and using malware for WMI persistence, both of which are methods used after initial access to a network has been gained.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This is the tactic where the adversary first gains access to the network. Given that persistence is about maintaining access, initial access must have occurred before persistence.
   - **B: Persistence**: This is the tactic being described in the question itself, not a precursor to it.
   - **C: Discovery**: While discovery (which involves the adversary learning more about the network and its systems) could occur after initial access and potentially before or concurrently with establishing persistence, it is not the most direct precursor to establishing persistence.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: Reconnaissance is often associated with the pre-attack phase or initial stages of an attack, gathering information about the target. While important, it is not as directly linked to the act of establishing persistence as initial access is.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Establishing persistence implies the adversary is already inside the network.
   - The most logical precursor to establishing persistence is gaining initial access to the network.
   - Initial access (A) is the point at which the adversary first enters the network, making it the most likely tactic to have occurred before establishing persistence.

**Final Answer: A**
