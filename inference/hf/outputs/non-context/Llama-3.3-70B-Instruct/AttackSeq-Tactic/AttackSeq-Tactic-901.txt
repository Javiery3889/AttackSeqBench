To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions evading defenses using techniques like DLL side-loading to launch malicious payloads. This is a method used to avoid detection by security software.
   - It then asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to allow PKPLUG (a malware/tool) to communicate with and control compromised systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial technique mentioned is "DLL side-loading," which is a method of defense evasion. This technique is used to execute malicious code under the guise of a legitimate process.
   - The question then shifts focus to the communication and control of compromised systems, implying a need for the malware (PKPLUG) to establish a connection back to its command and control (C2) servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that allow malware to maintain its presence on a system. While important, it doesn't directly relate to the communication aspect.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic has already been utilized (through DLL side-loading), but the question asks for the tactic that follows, related to communication and control.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This involves obtaining credentials to access systems or resources. It's not directly related to the communication between malware and C2 servers.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between compromised systems and the attackers' C2 servers, enabling the control of the compromised systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial step of evading defenses (through DLL side-loading) suggests the malware has successfully executed on the target system.
   - The next logical step for the malware, after evading defenses and launching its payload, would be to establish a means of communication with its C2 servers to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.
   - The tactic that directly supports this capability is Command and Control, as it involves techniques for establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attackers.

**Final Answer: D**
