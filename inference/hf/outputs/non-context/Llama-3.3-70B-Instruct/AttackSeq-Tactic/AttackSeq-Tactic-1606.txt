To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the Taidoor attackers gained initial access, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that the Taidoor attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities using malicious documents. This indicates the attackers used a specific method to gain entry into the system, which is classified under the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **before** this initial access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves an initial access method (exploiting vulnerabilities via malicious documents), but we're looking for what likely happened before this step. In a typical attack sequence, before gaining initial access, attackers often gather information about their target.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that involves gaining an initial foothold into a system, which is what the attackers did by exploiting vulnerabilities. However, the question asks for the tactic before this, so this choice doesn't fit.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving within a network after initial access has been gained. Since the question is about what happened before initial access, this choice doesn't apply.
   - **C: Discovery**: While discovery is an important part of the attack lifecycle, it typically occurs after initial access has been gained, as it involves finding information about the system, network, or application being attacked.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before attempting to gain access. It's a precursor to initial access and involves activities like gathering information about the target's security posture, network layout, and potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers used malicious documents to gain initial access, indicating a targeted attack.
   - Before such an attack, it's logical that the attackers would gather information about their target to understand potential vulnerabilities and the best method of attack.
   - Reconnaissance is the tactic that aligns with this preparatory phase of gathering information before attempting to breach a system.

**Final Answer: D**
