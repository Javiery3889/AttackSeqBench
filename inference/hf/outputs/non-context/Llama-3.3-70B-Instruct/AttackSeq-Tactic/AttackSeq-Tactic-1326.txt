To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that followed the establishment of a WebSocket connection to control a JavaScript backdoor and read emails from the webmail server, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after establishing a connection, is controlling a backdoor and accessing emails. This implies the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now leveraging that access for further malicious activities.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key actions here are establishing a connection (likely for command and control purposes), controlling a backdoor, and reading emails. These actions suggest the attacker is in the phase of exploiting the access gained to collect sensitive information.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While the WebSocket connection does facilitate C2, the question asks for the tactic that "most likely followed" after this connection was established, implying we're looking for what the attacker did after setting up C2.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves creating, purchasing, or compromising resources that can be used to support an operation. While resource development could be a part of the broader campaign, it doesn't directly relate to the actions of controlling a backdoor and reading emails.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network to expand access. While possible, the question doesn't specifically indicate movement between systems; it focuses on actions taken after a connection was established.
   - **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the target system. Reading emails from a webmail server directly aligns with exfiltrating sensitive information, which is a common goal after an attacker has established control over a system or backdoor.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained access and established a means of command and control.
   - The actions described (controlling a backdoor and reading emails) are aimed at exploiting the access for data theft.
   - Exfiltration is the tactic most directly related to the goal of stealing sensitive information (in this case, emails).

**Final Answer: D**
