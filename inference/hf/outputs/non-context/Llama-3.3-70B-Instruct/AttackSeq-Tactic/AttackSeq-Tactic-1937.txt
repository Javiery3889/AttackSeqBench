To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Mustang Panda uses a custom loader to execute a new Korplug variant. Before this execution, the attackers delivered malicious documents with filenames related to current events. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic most likely involved in this initial delivery phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) here involves delivering malicious documents (likely via phishing or some form of social engineering) and then executing malware (the Korplug variant) using a custom loader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves the development and acquisition of resources, such as infrastructure or capabilities, that can be used to support operations. While resource development is crucial for attackers, it doesn't directly relate to the delivery of malicious documents or the initial stages of an attack.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic involves the attackers' initial entry point into a network or system. Delivering malicious documents, especially those disguised as relevant or interesting to the target (e.g., 'COVID-19 travel restrictions EU reviews list of third countries.exe'), is a common technique used for initial access, often through phishing or spearphishing.
   - **Execution (C)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. While the question does mention the execution of a Korplug variant, the specific action of delivering malicious documents with enticing filenames is more about gaining initial access rather than the execution phase itself.
   - **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials that can be used to access systems, data, or services. While credential access might be a goal of the attackers, the delivery of malicious documents with current event themes is more directly related to gaining initial access to a system rather than obtaining credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The delivery of malicious documents, especially those with filenames designed to pique the interest of potential victims (e.g., related to current events like COVID-19), is a technique commonly used in phishing attacks.
   - Phishing and similar social engineering tactics are primarily used for gaining **Initial Access** to a system or network.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic most likely involved in delivering these malicious documents is **Initial Access**.

Final Answer: B
