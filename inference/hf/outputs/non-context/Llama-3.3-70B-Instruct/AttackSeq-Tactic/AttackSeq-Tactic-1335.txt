To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions a sequence of events involving a dropper app, which downloads exploits and payloads from a Command and Control (C&C) server. After this, the callCam app encrypts collected data for transmission. We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after these events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The initial event is the dropper apps downloading exploits and payloads from the C&C server. This action suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the system (Initial Access) and is now setting up for further exploitation.
   - The encryption of collected data by the callCam app for transmission indicates that the attacker is preparing to send stolen data back to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining an initial foothold into the system. Given that the dropper apps are already downloading exploits and payloads, it's likely that initial access has already been achieved.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving laterally within a network to expand access. While possible, the question doesn't specifically mention movement within the network but rather focuses on data transmission.
   - **C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the attacker transferring data from the compromised system to an external system under their control. The encryption of collected data for transmission strongly suggests that data exfiltration is about to occur or is occurring.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic is about establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C&C server. While the C&C server is mentioned, the question asks for the tactic following the downloading of exploits and payloads, which implies that Command and Control is already being established or has been established.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The dropper apps downloading exploits and payloads indicate a post-initial access phase where the attacker is preparing for further exploitation or data theft.
   - The encryption of data by the callCam app for transmission is a strong indicator of data being prepared for exfiltration.
   - Given these steps, the most logical next tactic in the sequence described would be the exfiltration of the encrypted data.

**Final Answer: C**
