To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that FIN13 used WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations after employing techniques for internal reconnaissance and gathering information on network configurations and services. This implies that the attackers had already gained access to the network and were in the process of exploring it and expanding their control.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned (using WMI and custom web shells) are related to maintaining access, executing commands, and possibly moving laterally within the network. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before these actions, which involved internal reconnaissance and gathering information.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining resources (e.g., infrastructure, tools) that can be used to support an operation. While resource development is crucial for attackers, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of actions described (internal reconnaissance and then using specific tools for cross-platform operations).
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gather information about the system, network, or organization. Given that the question mentions "after employing various techniques for internal reconnaissance and gathering information," this aligns closely with the Discovery tactic, as it involves exploring the network and gathering information about its configurations and services.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves the attacker moving through a network to expand their access. While using WMI and custom web shells could be part of lateral movement, the question asks for the tactic before these specific actions, which seems to be more about exploring and understanding the network layout rather than moving through it.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining an initial foothold within a network. The actions described (using WMI, custom web shells for cross-platform operations) suggest that initial access had already been achieved, and the attackers were in a later stage of their operation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes actions that follow initial access and involve exploring the network.
   - The use of WMI and custom web shells indicates the attackers were past the initial access phase and were engaged in activities that could facilitate further movement or persistence.
   - The tactic that most likely occurred before these actions, given the context of internal reconnaissance and gathering information, is **Discovery**.

Final Answer: B
