To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after gathering system-related details and browser history during the initial stages, credentials were stolen from applications such as MS Outlook and Mail.ru Agent. The initial stages involve gathering information, which is typically associated with the early phases of an attack.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with gathering system-related details and browser history. This action is indicative of an attacker trying to understand the environment and potential vulnerabilities or targets within it. The next step involves stealing credentials from specific applications, which suggests the attacker is looking to gain access to sensitive information or systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gather information about the system, network, or application. It aligns with the initial action of gathering system-related details and browser history but doesn't directly relate to stealing credentials.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access to a system or network. While important for long-term access, it doesn't directly relate to the initial gathering of information or the act of stealing credentials.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This is the tactic of gathering information about the target before actually attacking it. Reconnaissance can include gathering system details and browser history, fitting the initial stages described. It precedes the exploitation phase where credentials might be stolen.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate systems and data. While stealing credentials can have an impact, the description provided focuses more on the information gathering and access phase rather than the disruption or manipulation phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial action of gathering system-related details and browser history suggests an information-gathering phase.
   - The subsequent action of stealing credentials indicates the attacker is moving towards exploiting the gathered information for access.
   - Reconnaissance (C) is the tactic that most closely aligns with the initial information-gathering phase, which would logically precede the exploitation or credential theft phase.

**Final Answer: C**
