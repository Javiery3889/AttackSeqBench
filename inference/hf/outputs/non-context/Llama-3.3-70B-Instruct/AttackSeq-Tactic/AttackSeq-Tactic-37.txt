To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described actions, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions a PowerShell script that operates in memory. This indicates an attempt to evade detection since operating in memory (as opposed to writing files to disk) can make it harder for traditional antivirus software to detect malicious activity.
   - It leveraged the DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk. DCOM is a protocol that enables software components to communicate with each other, and in this context, it's being used to execute files without explicitly saving them to the disk, which is another evasion technique.
   - The key actions here are evasion of detection and execution of files without saving them to disk.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script operates in memory and uses DCOM to execute files without saving them to disk, both of which are techniques used to evade detection.
     - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** these evasion techniques were employed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials that can be used to access systems, data, or services. While credential access might be a goal of an attacker, it doesn't directly follow from the described evasion and execution techniques.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: The described actions (operating in memory, using DCOM to execute files without saving them to disk) are themselves defense evasion techniques. The question asks for what happened after these evasion techniques, not the evasion itself.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a system. Given that the PowerShell script was executing downloaded files, this is a strong candidate because the execution of these files would be the immediate next step after evasion techniques are successfully employed to avoid detection.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for command and control (C2) between the attacker and the compromised system. While C2 is crucial for an attacker to issue commands, it might not be the immediate next step after executing files, especially if those files are designed to achieve specific goals without needing immediate C2.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The PowerShell script's primary goal, as described, is to execute downloaded files without detection.
   - The use of DCOM for execution without saving files to disk is a technique that facilitates the execution of malicious code.
   - Therefore, the most direct and immediate tactic following the successful evasion and execution of files would be the **Execution** tactic itself, as it directly relates to the running of the malicious code on the system.
   - **Final Answer: C**
