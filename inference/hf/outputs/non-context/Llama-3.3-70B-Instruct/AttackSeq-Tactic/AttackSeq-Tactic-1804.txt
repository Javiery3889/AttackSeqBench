To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the email with a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment was opened, let's break down the scenario and analyze the options provided.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The scenario involves an email with a PDF attachment that actually contains a disguised executable file. When opened, this file initiates the attack sequence. This implies that the attacker has already gained access to Susan's system, at least to the point of executing malicious code.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) here involves social engineering (possibly Phishing, which is a technique under the Initial Access tactic) to trick the victim into opening the malicious attachment, followed by the execution of the malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker's initial entry point into the network. Techniques under this tactic include Phishing, which aligns with the scenario of sending a malicious email attachment. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred "after" the attachment was opened, suggesting that initial access has already been achieved.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining their presence within the system. While persistence is a likely goal after initial access, the immediate action of opening a malicious file would more directly relate to executing malicious code rather than establishing persistence mechanisms.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While reconnaissance might occur at various stages of an attack, the act of opening a malicious attachment does not directly imply reconnaissance; it's more about executing malicious code.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. Given that the disguised executable file was opened, initiating the attack sequence, this directly aligns with the execution of malicious code, which is the immediate consequence of the user's action.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack sequence starts with social engineering (phishing) to get the victim to open the attachment.
   - Upon opening, the malicious code (disguised as a PDF) executes, which directly corresponds to the Execution tactic.
   - The question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after the attachment was opened, pointing towards the immediate consequence of that action, which is the execution of the malicious code.

**Final Answer: D**
