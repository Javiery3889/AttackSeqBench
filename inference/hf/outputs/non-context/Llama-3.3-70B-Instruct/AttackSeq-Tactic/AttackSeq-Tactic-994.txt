To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework tactics.

1. **Spear-phishing attack**: This is a method used to gain initial access to a system. In the ATT&CK framework, this aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic, which involves techniques used to gain an initial foothold within a network.

2. **Exploitation of Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119)**: After gaining initial access, the next step involves exploiting a vulnerability to deliver a secondary payload. This action is part of the "Execution" tactic, as it involves executing malicious code on the victim's system. However, the exploitation itself is more closely related to the "Exploitation for Client Execution" technique under the "Execution" tactic.

3. **Delivery of a secondary payload and execution of ActionScript classes to install the payload**: The delivery and execution of the payload are also part of the "Execution" tactic, as they involve running malicious code on the victim's system.

Given the sequence of events:
- The spear-phishing attack is used for **Initial Access**.
- The exploitation of the Adobe Flash vulnerability leads to the **Execution** of malicious code.
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **before** the execution of the ActionScript classes to install the payload.

Considering the above points, the tactic that occurs before the execution of malicious code (in this case, the ActionScript classes) would be the one related to gaining access to the system where the exploitation and subsequent execution can take place.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Identify the sequence: Spear-phishing for initial access, exploitation of a vulnerability, and execution of malicious code.
2. Map to ATT&CK tactics: Initial Access for the spear-phishing, Execution for the exploitation and payload installation.
3. Determine the preceding tactic: Since Execution is the tactic involving the running of malicious code, the tactic before this would logically be how the attackers initially got access to execute this code.

**Final Answer: D**
