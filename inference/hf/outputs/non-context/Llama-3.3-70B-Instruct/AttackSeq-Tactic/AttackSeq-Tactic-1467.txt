To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after internal reconnaissance on the control environment of critical systems and before using malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations, let's analyze the sequence of events and the tactics involved.

1. **Internal Reconnaissance**: This step involves gathering information about the internal workings of the control environment. In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this aligns with the "Discovery" tactic, which involves the adversary trying to gather information about the system, network, or organization.

2. **Using Malicious Updates to Sever Connections**: This action implies modifying or manipulating existing software or systems to disrupt operations. This could be part of the "Impact" tactic, which involves the adversary attempting to manipulate, disrupt, or destroy data or systems.

Given these two points, we are looking for a tactic that logically fits between "Discovery" (which has already occurred) and "Impact" (which is the ultimate goal of severing connections). The options provided are:

- **A: Impact**: This is the tactic most directly related to the action of using malicious updates to cause harm or disruption, such as severing connections.
- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a means for the adversary to issue commands to compromised systems. While important, it doesn't directly fit the sequence described, as it's more about maintaining control over compromised systems rather than the act of disrupting operations.
- **C: Discovery**: This has already occurred, as the question states that internal reconnaissance has been conducted.
- **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within an environment. It could potentially fit between discovery and impact, as an adversary might need to move laterally to reach the systems they wish to update maliciously.

However, considering the specific action of using malicious updates to sever connections, the most direct precursor to this action, after discovery, would be gaining the necessary access or position to implement such updates. Lateral movement could be a part of this process, especially if the adversary needs to access specific systems or networks to carry out the update. But the question seems to focus on the action that directly precedes the impact, which is more about the positioning and preparation for the disruptive action rather than the disruption itself.

Given the choices and focusing on the sequence provided:
- The adversary has already conducted internal reconnaissance (Discovery).
- The goal is to use malicious updates to sever connections, which is an action that would fall under Impact.

The most plausible sequence suggests that after discovering the internal workings, the next step would involve positioning themselves to carry out the malicious update, which could involve **Lateral Movement** to reach the necessary systems or networks. However, the question's framing suggests looking for a tactic that directly precedes the impact of severing connections, which might not necessarily require lateral movement if the adversary already has the necessary access.

Considering the direct approach to the goal of using malicious updates to sever connections, and given that Discovery has already occurred, the tactic that most directly precedes Impact in this context, especially considering the need to position for and execute the update, would indeed be related to how the adversary interacts with the system. But since the question asks for the tactic most likely to occur before the impact of severing connections and after discovery, and considering the provided options:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Identify the sequence: Internal Reconnaissance (Discovery) -> ? -> Malicious Updates (Impact).
2. Evaluate options: 
   - A (Impact) is the goal.
   - B (Command and Control) is crucial but not directly the step before Impact in this context.
   - C (Discovery) has already happened.
   - D (Lateral Movement) could be necessary for positioning but isn't directly implied as the immediate precursor to the described Impact.

Given the context and focusing on the immediate precursor to the described action of using malicious updates to sever connections, the question seems to imply a need for a tactic that directly enables this action. However, the correct interpretation of the sequence provided and the tactics involved suggests that the question is looking for the tactic that logically precedes the impact, considering the adversary's actions.

**Final Answer: D**
