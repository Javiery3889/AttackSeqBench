To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before delivering the Taidoor malware via a spear-phishing email attachment exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158), let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Attack Vector**: The attack involves delivering malware (Taidoor) through a spear-phishing email. This method is used to gain initial access to a target's system. The exploit of a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) suggests a targeted attack aiming to execute malicious code on the victim's machine when they open the malicious attachment.

2. **Analyzing the ATT&CK Tactics**:
   - **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target environment, such as network and system configurations. While discovery is crucial for planning an attack, it typically occurs after initial access has been gained or in parallel with other tactics to refine the attack.
   - **Initial Access (B)**: This tactic is about how the attacker first gains access to the target network. Spear-phishing, especially when combined with exploiting a vulnerability like CVE-2012-0158, is a common method for achieving initial access.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before attempting to breach it. Reconnaissance would logically occur before attempting to deliver malware via spear-phishing, as it helps in identifying potential targets, vulnerabilities, and crafting a convincing phishing email.
   - **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic is focused on obtaining credentials that can be used to access systems or networks. While credential access might be a goal of the attack, it is not the most direct precursor to delivering malware via a spear-phishing campaign.

3. **Determining the Most Likely Preceding Tactic**:
   - Given that the attack involves delivering malware through a targeted phishing campaign, exploiting a known vulnerability, the most logical preceding tactic would be one that involves gathering information about the target to make the phishing attempt successful.
   - **Reconnaissance (C)** fits this description best because it involves activities that would precede the actual attack, such as identifying potential targets, understanding their email habits, and possibly even identifying the presence of vulnerable Microsoft Office versions on the target systems.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the attack vector: Spear-phishing with a malicious attachment exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
2. Understand the goal: Initial access to the target system.
3. Analyze each ATT&CK tactic in relation to the attack vector and goal.
4. Determine the most logical preceding tactic based on the analysis.

**Final Answer: C**
