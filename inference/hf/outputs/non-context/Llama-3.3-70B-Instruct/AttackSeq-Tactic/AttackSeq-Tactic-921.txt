To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT33 gained access through spear phishing and before they secured persistence, let's break down the sequence of events and the tactics involved.

1. **Initial Access**: APT33 used spear phishing campaigns to gain access to the targeted companies. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic, which involves techniques used to gain an initial foothold within a network.

2. **Sequence of Events**: After gaining initial access, an attacker would typically seek to understand the network layout, identify valuable assets, and possibly move laterally within the network to achieve their objectives. This phase involves gathering information about the environment, which is crucial before establishing a strong, persistent presence.

3. **Before Persistence**: The question mentions that before securing persistence using botnets, another tactic occurred. Persistence involves techniques that allow an adversary to maintain their presence within a network over time. The use of botnets for persistence indicates a later stage in the attack lifecycle, where the adversary has already gained sufficient knowledge of the network and has decided to establish a lasting presence.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Persistence**: This is the tactic of maintaining a presence within a network, which the question states happened after the tactic we are trying to identify. So, it's not the correct answer.
- **B: Initial Access**: This has already occurred, as APT33 used spear phishing to gain access. Therefore, it's not the correct answer because we're looking for a tactic that happened after initial access.
- **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control infrastructure or compromising third-party services. While important, the question's context suggests a focus on network interaction rather than external resource development.
- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gaining knowledge about the internal network, systems, and assets. After gaining initial access and before establishing persistence (especially through complex means like botnets), an attacker would likely engage in discovery activities to understand the network, identify potential targets, and plan the best approach for persistence and further exploitation.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial tactic used by APT33: Initial Access via spear phishing.
2. Understand the goal before persistence: The attackers needed to understand the network and possibly move laterally.
3. Evaluate each option against the sequence of events and the goals of the attackers.

**Final Answer**: D
