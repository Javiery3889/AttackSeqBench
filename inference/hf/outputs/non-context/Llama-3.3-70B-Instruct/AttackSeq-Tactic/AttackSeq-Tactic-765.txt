To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) where the attackers gained initial access by disguising malware as legitimate software updates for hotel guests. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic was most likely involved in obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay, before the initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The key elements here are "obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts" and the context of the Darkhotel APT's operation. The tactic we're looking for precedes the "Initial Access" tactic, as it involves gathering information necessary for the subsequent attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves acquiring resources such as personnel, infrastructure, or capabilities necessary for operations. While resource development is crucial for attackers, it doesn't directly involve gathering information about specific victims' locations or identities.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about potential targets, which can include their whereabouts, habits, or vulnerabilities. Reconnaissance is a precursor to many attacks, as it helps attackers select and prepare for targeting specific victims.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining an initial foothold within a network or system. The question specifies that the initial access was achieved through malware disguised as software updates, but it asks for the tactic that occurred before this step.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems or assets. It is not related to the initial gathering of information about potential victims.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that involves obtaining knowledge about victims before the attack.
   - Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about targets, which fits the description of obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
   - The other options do not directly relate to the act of gathering preliminary information about targets.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gathering information about the targets, which aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic.

Final Answer: B
