To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the attackers managed to compromise Avast's download servers, embed a malicious binary into the CCleaner software, and then have that software downloaded and executed by users, leading to the deployment of a malware payload. The key elements here are the compromise of the download servers and the embedding of malicious code into a legitimate software package.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied here starts with gaining access to Avast's infrastructure (specifically, the download servers), modifying a legitimate software package (CCleaner) to include malicious code, and then using the compromised software to execute the malicious payload on the users' systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems. While command and control is crucial for the post-exploitation phase, it doesn't directly relate to the initial compromise of Avast's servers or the embedding of the malware.
   - **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. While execution is a part of the attack sequence described, it's more about the phase after the malware is already on the system, not about how the malware got there in the first place.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within an infrastructure. While lateral movement might be relevant in some attacks, the question focuses on the initial compromise and distribution of malware, not movement within a network.
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network or system. Compromising Avast's download servers to embed malicious code into software would indeed be a method of gaining initial access to the systems of the software's users.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely enabled the attackers to compromise Avast's download servers and embed the malicious binary.
   - The compromise of Avast's servers and the embedding of the malware into CCleaner would be the initial step in the attack sequence, aimed at gaining access to the users' systems.
   - Therefore, the tactic that best aligns with this initial phase of the attack is **Initial Access**.

Final Answer: D
