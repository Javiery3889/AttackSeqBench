To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Turla utilized a PowerShell script to install the LightNeuron backdoor on the compromised Microsoft Exchange servers, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Tactic "Execution"**: The use of a PowerShell script to install malware (in this case, the LightNeuron backdoor) falls under the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Execution involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system.

2. **Analyzing Preceding Tactics**:
   - **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the initial entry point of the adversary into the network. While it's a starting point, the question implies a sequence of actions leading up to the execution of a PowerShell script, suggesting that initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Discovery (B)**: After gaining initial access, an adversary would likely perform discovery to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and gather information necessary for further actions. This could include identifying Microsoft Exchange servers as targets.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network, often to reach specific targets or to expand control within the network. If the initial access point was not directly on the Microsoft Exchange servers, lateral movement might be necessary to reach them.
   - **Execution (D)**: As mentioned, this is the tactic where the PowerShell script is utilized, which is the point of interest in the question.

Given the context that the PowerShell script was used to install the LightNeuron backdoor on compromised Microsoft Exchange servers, it implies that the adversary had already gained access to the network and was in a position to execute code on those specific servers.

3. **Determining the Most Likely Preceding Tactic**:
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to have occurred before the execution of the PowerShell script. Since execution is the act of running the script, we look at what would logically precede this action in terms of network compromise and movement.
   - **Initial Access (A)** is too early in the sequence, as it's about getting into the network, not about navigating within it or executing code on specific servers.
   - **Discovery (B)** could be a strong candidate because, after gaining access, an adversary would need to discover where the Microsoft Exchange servers are and potentially other details before executing a script to install a backdoor.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)** is also plausible if the initial access point was not the Exchange server itself, as the adversary would need to move laterally to reach the target servers.
   - **Execution (D)** is the tactic being performed (running the PowerShell script), so it cannot precede itself.

Considering the logical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, **Discovery (B)** is a critical step that would likely occur before executing a targeted action like installing a backdoor on specific servers. The adversary needs to know what systems are present, their roles, and how they can be exploited or used for further malicious activities. However, given the specific context of the question, which implies targeted action on Microsoft Exchange servers, **Lateral Movement (C)** could also be a strong candidate if we consider that the initial access might not have been directly to these servers.

Between **Discovery (B)** and **Lateral Movement (C)**, **Lateral Movement (C)** seems more directly related to the action of executing a script on specific servers (Microsoft Exchange servers) because it implies movement to those servers if they were not the initial access point. However, the question's focus is on the tactic before the execution of the PowerShell script, which suggests that the adversary is already in a position to execute code on the target system, making **Lateral Movement (C)** a slightly more fitting choice in the context of reaching the specific target (Microsoft Exchange servers) before executing the script.

**Final Answer: C**
