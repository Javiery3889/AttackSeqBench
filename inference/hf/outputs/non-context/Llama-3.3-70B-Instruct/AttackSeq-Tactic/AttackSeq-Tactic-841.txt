To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the use of anti-analysis features such as code obfuscation, anti-virtualization, and process hollowing. These techniques are typically used by attackers to evade detection and analysis by security tools and researchers.
   - It also mentions the coordination of multiple operations against different targets using specific domains (axroot.com and adobeair.net). This implies a level of command and control (C2) communication, where attackers might be using these domains to issue commands or receive data from compromised systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial part of the question focuses on evasion techniques (code obfuscation, anti-virtualization, process hollowing), which are commonly associated with the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to evade detection and bypass security controls.
   - The latter part of the question hints at the use of domains for coordinating attacks, which suggests a command and control (C2) channel. In the ATT&CK framework, establishing and using C2 channels falls under the "Command and Control" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic aligns with the initial techniques mentioned (code obfuscation, anti-virtualization, process hollowing) but does not directly relate to the coordination of attacks using specific domains.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic directly relates to the use of domains (like axroot.com and adobeair.net) for coordinating multiple operations against different targets, which is a key aspect of C2 communications.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which does not directly align with the use of anti-analysis features or the coordination of attacks via specific domains.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems or data, which is not directly implied by the information provided in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers employ evasion techniques and then coordinate attacks using specific domains.
   - The use of domains for coordinating attacks suggests a need for command and control, which is essential for managing and directing compromised systems or malware across different targets.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of coordinating multiple operations and using specific domains, aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic.

Final Answer: B
