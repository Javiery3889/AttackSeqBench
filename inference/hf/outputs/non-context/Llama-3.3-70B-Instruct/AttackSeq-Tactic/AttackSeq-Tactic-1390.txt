To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT10 used tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation and before conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network, let's analyze the sequence of events and the tools mentioned:

1. **Initial Step**: APT10 used Quasar RAT and mimikatz. 
   - **Quasar RAT** is a remote access trojan that can be used for various malicious activities, including reconnaissance and establishing persistence on a compromised system.
   - **Mimikatz** is a tool used for credential harvesting, which aligns with the tactic of **Credential Access**.

2. **Given Sequence**: After using these tools for reconnaissance and propagation, the next step involves conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network. This implies that the attackers have already gained some level of access to the network and are now looking to understand its layout and potentially identify additional targets.

3. **Analysis of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to credentials (e.g., passwords, keys). The use of mimikatz aligns with this tactic, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the use of such tools.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that allow an adversary to maintain their presence on a system or network over time. While persistence is likely a goal, the question focuses on the sequence leading up to internal reconnaissance.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network to expand access and control. Given that the attackers are preparing to conduct internal reconnaissance to map the network, lateral movement could be a logical step after gaining initial access and before thoroughly mapping the network.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security controls and monitoring. While defense evasion is crucial throughout an attack, it doesn't directly fit the sequence described as leading up to internal network reconnaissance.

4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after gaining initial access and potentially obtaining credentials, the attackers would likely move laterally within the network to expand their access before conducting thorough internal reconnaissance. This makes **Lateral Movement** the most likely tactic to occur after the initial use of Quasar RAT and mimikatz and before conducting internal reconnaissance.

Final Answer: C
