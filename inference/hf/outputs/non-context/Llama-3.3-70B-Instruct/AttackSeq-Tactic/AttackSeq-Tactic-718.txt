To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an Aria-body backdoor has been used to gather system information, and the Naikon APT group has collected files, screenshots, and metadata. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next to facilitate communication with the Command and Control (C&C) server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described involves:
   - Gathering system information (using the Aria-body backdoor).
   - Collecting files, screenshots, and metadata (by the Naikon APT group).
   - The need to communicate with a C&C server for command reception and data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While collection has already occurred (gathering system information, collecting files), the question asks about facilitating communication with the C&C server, which is not primarily about collection but about communication.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system or network. While important for maintaining access or moving laterally, it doesn't directly relate to communicating with a C&C server.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gaining knowledge about the system, network, or organization. Similar to Collection, it's about gathering information, not about establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C&C server to receive commands and send stolen data. This directly matches the scenario described, where the goal is to facilitate communication for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes activities that have already occurred (information gathering, data collection) and asks about the next step in the attack sequence related to C&C communication.
   - The primary goal now is to establish or utilize a means of communication with the C&C server.
   - Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the tactic that directly involves communication with a C&C server for command reception and data exfiltration is Command and Control.
   
Final Answer: D
