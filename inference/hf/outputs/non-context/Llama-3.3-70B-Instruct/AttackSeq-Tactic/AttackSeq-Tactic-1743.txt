To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions "Command and Control" using steganography to hide C&C data in files like PDF or JPG. This implies that the attackers have already established a means to communicate with compromised systems or devices. The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to enable the attackers to transfer the stolen data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - Establishing Command and Control (already done).
   - The use of steganography for hiding C&C data, which is a technique under the "Defense Evasion" tactic, as it helps evade detection.
   - The goal is to transfer stolen data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before an attack. It doesn't directly relate to transferring stolen data.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: While the use of steganography is indeed a defense evasion technique, the question asks about transferring stolen data, not evading defenses.
   - **C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system. Given that the attackers have already established command and control and are looking to transfer stolen data, exfiltration is the most relevant tactic.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This is mentioned in the question as already being conducted, so it's not the next step in the sequence regarding transferring stolen data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers have established command and control and are using steganography to hide their communications.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, given the goal of transferring stolen data, is exfiltration.
   - Exfiltration directly involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to the attackers, which aligns with the goal mentioned in the question.

Final Answer: C
