To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described action, let's break down the information provided and analyze the options step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a SOCKSBOT implant has already achieved persistence on a system. It has done so by creating a Windows service named 'Check for updates' and setting it to 'delay-auto' start. Additionally, it has reflectively loaded itself to spoof legitimate services with similar names. This action primarily falls under the tactic of **Persistence** because it involves techniques used to maintain access to a system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The described action involves creating a service for persistence and using reflective loading to evade detection, which are techniques associated with Persistence (creating a service) and potentially Defense Evasion (spoofing legitimate services).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: While the action of spoofing legitimate services can be considered a form of Defense Evasion, the primary goal described (ensuring persistence) aligns more closely with Persistence. However, after establishing persistence, an attacker might focus on evading defenses to maintain access undetected.
   - **B: Command and Control**: Establishing Command and Control (C2) is a critical step after gaining initial access and ensuring persistence. It allows the attacker to issue commands to the compromised system. Given that persistence has been achieved, setting up or utilizing a C2 channel would be a logical next step to leverage the access gained.
   - **C: Persistence**: The question already states that persistence has been achieved through the creation of a Windows service and reflective loading. While persistence is an ongoing effort, the question seems to ask for the next likely tactic after this specific action.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. While this could be a next step after establishing a foothold, it's not directly implied by the actions described, which focus on maintaining access to the current system rather than expanding access to others.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained initial access and ensured persistence.
   - The next logical steps could involve either evading detection to maintain access, establishing a command and control channel to utilize the access, or moving laterally within the network.
   - Given the context, establishing a **Command and Control** channel would be a critical step to effectively utilize the compromised system, issue commands, and potentially exfiltrate data or move laterally.

**Final Answer: B**
