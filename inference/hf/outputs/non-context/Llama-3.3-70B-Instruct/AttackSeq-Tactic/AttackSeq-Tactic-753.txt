To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Kingslayer gained access through the supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software but before configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: Kingslayer has already gained access through a supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software. This means the initial access tactic has already been completed, so option C (Initial Access) is not the correct answer because the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this point.

2. **Configuring a Diurnal Beaconing Algorithm**: This action is related to evading detection, which falls under the **Defense Evasion** tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this action. Thus, while Defense Evasion (option D) is relevant to the overall sequence, it's the action that happens after the tactic we're trying to identify.

3. **Credential Access (Option A)**: After gaining initial access, an attacker often seeks to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network. Obtaining credentials is a common next step to achieve these goals. This tactic involves techniques used to obtain credentials, which could be necessary before configuring more sophisticated evasion techniques or before collecting sensitive data.

4. **Collection (Option B)**: While collection of data is a crucial part of many attacks, it might not necessarily occur immediately after initial access and before configuring evasion techniques. Collection can happen at various stages of the attack, depending on the attackers' goals and the information they seek.

Given the sequence described:
- Kingslayer has already achieved **Initial Access**.
- The next step we're looking for precedes **Defense Evasion** (configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm).
- **Credential Access** is a plausible next step after initial access, as it would provide the attackers with the means to further their goals within the compromised system or network, such as escalating privileges or moving laterally.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the point in the attack sequence: After initial access but before defense evasion.
2. Evaluate the necessity of each option at this point in the sequence.
3. Recognize that **Credential Access** is a common and logical next step after gaining initial access, as it facilitates further movement and action within the target system or network.

**Final Answer: A**
