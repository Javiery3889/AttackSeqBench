To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before APT10 deployed malware for long-term remote access and performed internal reconnaissance, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of malware (such as PlugX or Quasar RAT) for long-term remote access and the performance of internal reconnaissance to establish a foothold on the network. This indicates actions taken after an initial breach has occurred, focusing on establishing persistence and gathering information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve deploying malware for remote access and performing internal reconnaissance. These actions are typically part of the "Persistence" and "Discovery" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, respectively. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before these actions, which suggests we are looking for an earlier phase in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system, which could be part of the process but doesn't necessarily precede the deployment of malware for remote access in a linear sequence.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network, which would logically precede the deployment of malware for long-term access and internal reconnaissance. It makes sense as a precursor to establishing persistence and gathering information.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information relevant to the adversary's objective, which would typically occur after initial access has been gained and some level of persistence has been established.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic involves actions taken to disrupt, manipulate, or destroy data and systems, which would generally occur later in the attack sequence, often after reconnaissance and establishment of access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before deploying malware and performing internal reconnaissance.
   - Deploying malware for long-term access and performing internal reconnaissance are actions that an adversary would take after gaining access to a network.
   - Therefore, the most logical precursor to these actions is gaining initial access to the network.

**Final Answer: B**
