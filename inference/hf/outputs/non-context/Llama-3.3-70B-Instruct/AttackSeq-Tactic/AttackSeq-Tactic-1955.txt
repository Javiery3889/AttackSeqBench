To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where a victim's computer has been surveyed, and specific information (name, machine serial number, system information) has been sent to a remote server.
   - The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 by OceanLotus is mentioned.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involves surveying the victim's computer and communicating with a remote server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery (A)**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system or network. While surveying the victim's computer fits into discovery, the act of sending information to a remote server and the subsequent use of a custom binary protocol for communication suggests a step beyond mere discovery.
   - **Impact (B)**: This tactic is about the attacker's actions to disrupt or manipulate the system or data. The described actions do not directly imply disruption or manipulation but rather communication and potentially command and control.
   - **Command and Control (C)**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling the compromised system. Using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is indicative of setting up a secure, covert channel for command and control communications, which aligns well with the actions described after the initial survey and data exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker removing data from the system. While sending system information to a remote server could be considered exfiltration, the specific mention of using a custom protocol for communication suggests an ongoing interaction rather than a one-time data theft.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial survey of the victim's computer and sending of system information could be part of the **Discovery** tactic, but this is not what the question asks about as the "next" step.
   - The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 by OceanLotus indicates an attempt to establish a secure and possibly covert communication channel with the compromised system.
   - This action is most closely aligned with establishing **Command and Control**, as it enables the attacker to issue commands to the compromised system and receive responses in a secure manner.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step in the sequence of TTPs described is the establishment of **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: C
