To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next after the execution of JavaScript and Windows executable files to install malware, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes the execution of specific files (05sall.js and module.avi.exe) to install malware. This action implies that an attacker has already gained access to the system, at least to the extent of being able to execute files.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The execution of files to install malware falls under the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This is because the attacker is executing malicious code (in the form of JavaScript and executable files) on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within an internal network. While possible after installing malware, it's not the immediate next step after executing files to install malware.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or environment. After installing malware, an attacker might use the malware for discovery, but this isn't the most direct next step after execution.
   - **C: Execution**: This is the tactic that has just occurred, as described in the question. The execution of malicious files to install malware directly aligns with this tactic.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling the malware that has been installed. After malware installation, an attacker would likely establish command and control to direct the malware's actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes the execution of malicious files, which aligns with the "Execution" tactic.
   - Immediately after installing malware through execution, the most logical next step for an attacker would be to establish a means to control the malware, which is essential for further actions like data exfiltration, lateral movement, or additional malicious activities.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next tactic after executing files to install malware is establishing **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D**
