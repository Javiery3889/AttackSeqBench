To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the options step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that initial access was gained through malicious delivery documents using social engineering. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic, which involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before persistence was achieved, not the initial access method itself.

2. **Persistence**: The question mentions that persistence was achieved by adding the path to the VBS script to the task scheduler. This is a technique used to maintain access to the system. The tactic of "Persistence" involves methods that an adversary uses to keep access to a system or network over time.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: Already occurred, as per the question.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to evade detection and bypass security controls. Adding a script to the task scheduler could be part of defense evasion, as it might be done in a way to avoid detection, but the primary goal here seems to be persistence.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system or network. While reconnaissance might occur after initial access to plan further actions, it doesn't directly relate to achieving persistence through modifying the task scheduler.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. Adding a VBS script to the task scheduler to execute at a later time aligns with execution, as it ensures the script (and thus the adversary's code) will run.

Given the context that the question asks for the tactic that occurred before persistence was achieved by modifying the task scheduler, and considering that execution of code is a precursor to establishing persistence mechanisms like scheduling tasks, the most logical sequence is:

- Initial Access (already happened)
- Execution of the VBS script (to set up persistence)
- Persistence (achieved by adding the script to the task scheduler)

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before persistence was achieved, in this case, is the execution of the adversary's code to set up the persistence mechanism.

Final Answer: D
