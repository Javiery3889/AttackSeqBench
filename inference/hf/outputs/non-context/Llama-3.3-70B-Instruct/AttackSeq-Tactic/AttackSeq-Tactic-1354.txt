To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the actions of UNC1151, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - The question mentions that UNC1151 has already registered credential theft domains to spoof legitimate websites. This action is aimed at deceiving victims, likely as part of a phishing campaign.
   - The goal is to steal credentials, which implies that the attackers are looking to gain access to systems, data, or services that require authentication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action (registering domains to spoof legitimate websites) suggests a setup for phishing, which is a technique used for gaining initial access or obtaining credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving within a network to gain access to additional resources. While lateral movement might occur after initial access is gained, it doesn't directly relate to the act of stealing credentials through phishing.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves removing data from a system or network. Exfiltration would occur after the attackers have gained access and are looking to remove sensitive information, which is not the immediate goal described.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. Given that the attackers are using spoofed websites to steal credentials, this tactic aligns closely with the described actions.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. While phishing can be used for initial access, the specific mention of stealing credentials suggests that the focus is on obtaining the credentials themselves, which could be used for initial access but also for other purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have set up a means to deceive victims (spoofing legitimate websites).
   - The goal is to steal credentials, which directly aligns with obtaining access to systems or data.
   - Considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the tactic that most directly involves obtaining credentials is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C**
