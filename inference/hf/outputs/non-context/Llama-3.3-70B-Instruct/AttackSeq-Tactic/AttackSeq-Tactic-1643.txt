To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before SideCopy gained initial access, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions SideCopy gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and a complex infection chain. This indicates we are looking at the initial stages of an attack, specifically how the attacker first gains access to the target system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve initial access through malicious files and a subsequent infection chain. This suggests we are focusing on the early stages of an attack lifecycle, specifically the "Initial Access" phase.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving within a network to gain access to additional systems or data. It typically occurs after initial access has been gained, making it less likely to be the tactic that occurred before initial access.
   - **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems, data, or services. While credential access can be a part of the initial access phase, it is more about the actions taken after or as part of gaining access rather than before.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure necessary for operations, which could include developing or obtaining malware like the malicious LNK files and HTAs mentioned. However, it's more about preparing resources for the attack rather than the direct action of gaining access.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan the attack. Reconnaissance typically occurs before the initial access phase, as it helps attackers identify vulnerabilities and choose the best method for gaining access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to occur **before** initial access.
   - Initial access involves gaining entry into a system or network.
   - Reconnaissance is about gathering information to plan the attack, which logically precedes the initial access attempt.
   - The other options (Lateral Movement, Credential Access, Resource Development) either occur during or after the initial access phase or are not directly related to the planning phase that precedes initial access.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that reconnaissance would occur before attempting to gain initial access, as it involves gathering information necessary to plan and execute the initial access phase effectively.

Final Answer: D
