To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after installing webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence, the actors used tools like Mimikatz. Mimikatz is a tool known for extracting plaintext passwords, hash, PIN code, and kerberos tickets from memory, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the actors used such tools to pivot to additional systems.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Installing webshells for persistence.
   - Using tools like Mimikatz, which is associated with Credential Access (to extract credentials).
   - Pivoting to additional systems within the network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Credential Access**: This is the tactic directly associated with using tools like Mimikatz to obtain credentials. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before using such tools, suggesting that Credential Access is what happened during the use of Mimikatz, not before.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection. While defense evasion could occur at various stages of an attack, it's not directly implied as a prerequisite for using Mimikatz in the context provided.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It's a preliminary phase but not directly linked to the immediate actions before using tools like Mimikatz for credential extraction and pivoting.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the actor trying to gain knowledge about the system and network. Discovery would likely occur before attempting to use tools like Mimikatz to pivot, as understanding the network layout and available systems would be necessary for effective pivoting.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The actors have already gained initial access and installed webshells for persistence.
   - Before they can effectively use tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems, they would need to understand the network layout, including where other systems are and how they can be accessed.
   - The Discovery tactic (D) aligns with the actions an actor would take to gather this necessary information before pivoting.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the need for the actors to understand the network and system layout before using tools like Mimikatz to pivot, the most logical ATT&CK tactic that occurred before this action is Discovery.

Final Answer: D
