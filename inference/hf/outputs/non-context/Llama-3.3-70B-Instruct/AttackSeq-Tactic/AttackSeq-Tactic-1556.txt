To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the attackers executed malicious code using DESLoader, following their penetration of the network through SSL-VPN abuse or stolen credentials, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The attackers have already gained access to the network. This access was achieved through either SSL-VPN abuse or by using stolen credentials. The use of DESLoader for executing malicious code indicates a stage where the attackers are already inside the network and are looking to execute their payload.

2. **Identifying the TTPs**: 
   - **Initial Access (Tactic)**: This involves the attackers gaining an initial foothold within the network. Methods include exploiting public-facing applications, using stolen credentials, or driving-by compromises, among others. Given that the attackers penetrated the network through SSL-VPN abuse or stolen credentials, this tactic has already been accomplished.
   - **Execution (Tactic)**: This involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. The use of DESLoader falls under this category as it is a method to execute malicious code.

3. **Analyzing Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Execution**: This is the tactic that involves executing malicious code, which aligns with the use of DESLoader but does not precede it in the sequence of actions.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing resources that can be used for future operations, such as setting up command and control infrastructure. While important, it does not directly precede the execution of malicious code in a necessary sequence.
   - **C: Impact**: This tactic involves actions taken to disrupt or manipulate the system or data. It typically follows the execution of malicious code and is not a precursor to it.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that involves gaining an initial foothold in the network, which has already been achieved through SSL-VPN abuse or stolen credentials.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the attackers have already gained access to the network (through SSL-VPN abuse or stolen credentials) and are now executing malicious code using DESLoader, the most logical preceding tactic in the sequence provided is **Initial Access**. This is because gaining access to the network is a necessary precursor to executing malicious code within that network.

Final Answer: D
