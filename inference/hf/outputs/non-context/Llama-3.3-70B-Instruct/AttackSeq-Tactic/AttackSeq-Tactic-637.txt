To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving GreyEnergy, a malware known for targeting industrial control systems (ICS). It mentions that before achieving initial access through spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers, GreyEnergy likely engaged in a specific tactic to inform their targeting of ICS control workstations and servers running SCADA software.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The question implies a sequence where the attackers first gather information about their target (in this case, ICS control workstations and servers) before launching a spearphishing campaign and compromising web servers to gain initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the attacker and the compromised systems. It doesn't directly relate to the initial targeting phase.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the creation, purchase, or compromise of resources (like infrastructure or tools) that can be used for future operations. While it's a preparatory phase, it's more about developing capabilities rather than targeting.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information that can be used for future operations. It's a broad category but doesn't specifically focus on the initial reconnaissance needed for targeting.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target environment, which directly supports the planning and execution of the attack, including identifying potential vulnerabilities and targets such as ICS control workstations and servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of specific systems.
   - The attackers needed to identify and understand their targets before launching a targeted attack like spearphishing.
   - Reconnaissance is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target, which would be necessary before deciding which systems to target and how to craft the spearphishing campaign.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the need for GreyEnergy to gather information about their targets before the attack, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is Reconnaissance.

Final Answer: D
