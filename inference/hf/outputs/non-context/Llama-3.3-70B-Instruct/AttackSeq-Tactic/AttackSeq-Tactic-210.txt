To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where a group, Dropping Elephant, uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gain initial access to high-profile targets, specifically diplomatic and economic entities.
   - The focus is on gathering information, which implies the group is in the early stages of their operation, aiming to understand their targets better.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve gaining initial access through specific methods (spear-phishing and watering hole attacks).
   - The goal is to gather information, which suggests that after gaining access, the next logical step would involve exploring and mapping out the target's environment to identify valuable data or systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that involves gaining an initial foothold within a network, which aligns with the spear-phishing and watering hole attacks mentioned. However, the question asks for the tactic that "most likely occurred" after gaining access, as the focus is on gathering information.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic involves causing an effect on the target, such as data destruction or denial of service, which does not align with the goal of gathering information.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to learn more about the environment they have gained access to, which could be part of gathering information but is more about understanding the network and systems rather than the initial step of gathering information about the target.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target before or after gaining access, which fits the description of targeting diplomatic and economic entities with a focus on gathering information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Given that the question specifies the group's focus on gathering information about diplomatic and economic entities, it suggests that before or as part of their initial access, they would engage in reconnaissance to understand their targets better.
   - Reconnaissance can occur before initial access as part of planning and can continue after access is gained to gather more specific information about the internal environment.
   - The other options either describe the act of gaining access itself (Initial Access) or actions that occur after information gathering has begun (Discovery, Impact).

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Based on the information provided and the focus on gathering information about the targets before or as part of the initial access phase, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic is Reconnaissance.

Final Answer: D
