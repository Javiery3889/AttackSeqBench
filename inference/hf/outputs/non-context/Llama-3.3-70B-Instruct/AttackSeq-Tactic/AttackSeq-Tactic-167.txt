To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the use of encrypted backdoors in memory and the configuration of loader DLLs to evade detection. This already indicates that the attacker has gained some level of access to the system and is taking steps to remain undetected.
   - It specifically talks about Lazarus backdoors connecting to specific servers for task management. Lazarus is a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, and their backdoors are used for maintaining access and controlling compromised systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The use of encrypted backdoors and evasion techniques suggests that the attacker is past the initial access phase and is focused on maintaining access and avoiding detection.
   - Connecting to specific servers for task management implies a level of command and control (C2) communication, where the compromised system receives instructions from the attacker's command center.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker's initial entry into the system. Given that the question describes activities that imply the attacker is already inside the system (using backdoors, evading detection), this choice seems too early in the sequence.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This involves gathering information about the target system or network. While reconnaissance can occur at various stages of an attack, the specific actions described (using backdoors, connecting to servers for task management) suggest the attacker is beyond the information-gathering phase.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: The question mentions configuring loader DLLs to evade detection, which aligns with defense evasion. However, the primary focus of the question seems to be on what happens after evasion techniques are put in place, particularly the connection to servers for task management.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling the compromised system. The mention of Lazarus backdoors connecting to specific servers for task management directly aligns with command and control activities, as it implies the attacker is using these backdoors to issue commands or receive data from the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attacker has already gained access and is using techniques to evade detection.
   - The primary action described (connecting to servers for task management) is about controlling the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the most likely next step in the sequence, given the context provided, is related to commanding and controlling the compromised system.

Final Answer: D
