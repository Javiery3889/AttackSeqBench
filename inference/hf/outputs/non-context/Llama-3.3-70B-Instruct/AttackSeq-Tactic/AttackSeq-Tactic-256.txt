To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before UNC2452 used a supply chain compromise for Initial Access in the SolarWinds Orion platform attack, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Attack**: The SolarWinds Orion platform attack involved a supply chain compromise where attackers inserted malicious code into software updates of the SolarWinds Orion IT monitoring and management software. This allowed them to gain access to the networks of numerous high-profile organizations.

2. **Identifying the Tactic in Question**: The tactic we are focusing on is the one that likely occurred before the Initial Access (TA0001) via the supply chain compromise. Initial Access refers to the tactics used by attackers to initially gain access to a network.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance (TA0043)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment and its defenses. It is a precursor to many attacks as it helps attackers understand potential vulnerabilities and plan their approach.
   - **B: Command and Control (TA0011)**: This tactic is about establishing a means for the attacker to issue commands to compromised systems within the target network. It typically occurs after Initial Access has been achieved.
   - **C: Discovery (TA0007)**: This involves the attacker learning more about the internal workings of the network and systems after gaining access. Like Command and Control, it usually happens after the attacker has already gained access.
   - **D: Resource Development (TA0022)**: This tactic is about the attacker developing or obtaining resources (like malware, infrastructure, etc.) that can be used in the attack. While it can occur at various stages, it's less directly tied to the sequence immediately before Initial Access in the context of planning and executing a supply chain attack.

4. **Evaluating the Sequence**: Given that the question asks for the tactic most likely to occur before the supply chain compromise for Initial Access, we need to consider which of these tactics would logically precede such an action. Reconnaissance is a foundational step in many attacks, as it allows attackers to identify vulnerabilities and plan their approach, including how to exploit a supply chain for initial access.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Reconnaissance (A) is the most plausible tactic to have occurred before the supply chain compromise. It aligns with the typical attack lifecycle, where understanding the target (in this case, the SolarWinds software update process and its security) would be crucial before attempting to compromise it.

Final Answer: A
