To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attackers implemented checks for security software to evade detection but before the SLUB malware variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information, let's break down the steps and analyze the given options.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of events where attackers first implement checks for security software to evade detection. This action is typically associated with the "Defense Evasion" tactic, as it involves techniques used to evade detection by security controls. After this, but before interacting with a Mattermost server to collect system information, we are looking for a tactic that fits within this timeline.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Defense Evasion**: This is the tactic where attackers try to evade detection. Implementing checks for security software falls under this category.
   - **Interaction with a Mattermost server to collect system information**: This action is related to collecting data about the system, which aligns with the "Collection" tactic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system or network. While it's the ultimate goal mentioned (collecting system information), we're looking for what likely happened immediately after defense evasion but before the collection of system information via the Mattermost server.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This has already occurred, as the attackers implemented checks for security software.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining an initial foothold on the system. Given that the attackers are already past the point of evading security software, initial access has likely already been achieved.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker trying to gain knowledge about the system, network, or organization. After evading detection and before collecting specific system information, the attackers would likely try to discover more about the environment they are operating in to plan their next steps effectively.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first evade detection (Defense Evasion).
   - Before they can collect specific system information, they would need to understand the environment better, which involves discovering the system, network, and its components.
   - Thus, the most plausible sequence after evading detection but before collecting system information is the "Discovery" phase, where they gather information about the system and its environment to facilitate further actions.

**Final Answer: D**
