To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions the Rising Sun implant performing initial reconnaissance. This suggests that the initial phase of the attack, which involves gathering information about the system and network, has already occurred.
   - The question specifically asks about establishing communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests after the initial reconnaissance.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial reconnaissance aligns with the "Discovery" tactic, which involves gathering information about the target system or network.
   - Establishing communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests is indicative of setting up a channel for command and control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the compromised system and the attacker's control servers. Using encrypted HTTP POST requests for this purpose fits well within this tactic, as it's a common method for hiding C2 communications within normal network traffic.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the creation, purchase, or compromise of resources (like infrastructure or tools) that can be used for future operations. While establishing C2 is crucial, the specific action of using encrypted HTTP POST requests for communication doesn't directly relate to resource development.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic has already occurred, as indicated by the initial reconnaissance. The question asks for the tactic that follows this phase, specifically related to establishing C2 communications.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system or network. While important for the attack's progression, it doesn't directly relate to establishing communication with control servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The initial reconnaissance phase (Discovery) has been completed.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, as described, involves setting up a means of communication with the attackers' control servers.
   - Using encrypted HTTP POST requests for this purpose is a method of establishing Command and Control (C2) communications, which is essential for the attackers to issue commands and receive data from the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial reconnaissance is the establishment of Command and Control communications.

Final Answer: A
