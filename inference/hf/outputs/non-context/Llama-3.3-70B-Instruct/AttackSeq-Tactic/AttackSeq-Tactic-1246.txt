To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Mustang Panda used spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files containing HTA scripts as a distribution method but before leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade detection, let's analyze the sequence of events described:

1. **Initial Access**: The use of spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files containing HTA scripts is a method of gaining initial access to a system. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Phishing" technique.

2. **Execution**: After gaining initial access, the next step involves executing the malicious code or payload on the victim's system. The fact that '.lnk' files with HTA scripts were used indicates that execution of malicious code has occurred, as these scripts would run on the victim's system, allowing the attackers to execute their code. This corresponds to the "Execution" tactic.

3. **Persistence and Defense Evasion**: The mention of leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade detection suggests actions taken after initial execution to maintain access and avoid being detected. PlugX is a remote access trojan (RAT) that can be used for persistence and to execute further malicious actions, while Cobalt Strike is a tool used for post-exploitation and can be utilized for defense evasion among other tactics.

Given this sequence, the question asks for the tactic most likely to occur after the initial execution (via spearphishing and HTA scripts) but before the defense evasion tactics (using PlugX and Cobalt Strike for evasion). 

- **Defense Evasion (A)** is the tactic of evading detection, which aligns with the use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike but is not what happens immediately after initial execution.
- **Collection (B)** involves gathering information, which could happen after initial access but is not directly implied by the use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike for evasion.
- **Discovery (C)** is about the adversary trying to gain knowledge about the system and network, which could occur after initial access but again is not directly related to the evasion tactics mentioned.
- **Execution (D)** is the tactic that involves executing malicious code, which has already occurred with the HTA scripts but considering the sequence, the question seems to ask for what happens after this initial execution but before evasion.

However, considering the sequence and the tactics provided, **Execution (D)** seems to be the closest match because the initial execution has occurred (via spearphishing and HTA scripts), and the next steps involve further execution of malicious code or commands (potentially through PlugX and Cobalt Strike), which could be part of setting up for defense evasion. The question's phrasing suggests looking for a step after initial access but before evasion, and given the options, **Execution** best fits as it directly follows initial access and precedes the actions taken for defense evasion in the attack sequence described.

Final Answer: D
