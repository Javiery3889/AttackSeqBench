To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Hi-Zor RAT used string-stacking and double XOR encoding for its operations and before it sent a victim's Volume Serial Number information through a secure TLS connection, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the use of string-stacking and double XOR encoding by Hi-Zor RAT. These techniques are typically used for obfuscation and evasion, suggesting that the malware is attempting to hide its activities from detection. The sending of a victim's Volume Serial Number information through a secure TLS connection implies a phase where the malware is exfiltrating data or communicating with its command and control (C2) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned (string-stacking and double XOR encoding) are related to evasion techniques, which fall under the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The action of sending information through a secure TLS connection could be part of "Command and Control" (for communicating with the C2 server) or "Exfiltration" (for sending stolen data out of the network), but given the context, it seems more closely related to establishing or maintaining communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining a communication channel with the C2 server. Given that the malware is sending information (Volume Serial Number) through a secure TLS connection, this could indeed be part of the Command and Control tactic, as it involves communication with the C2 server.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher privileges on a system. While important for many attacks, the information provided does not directly suggest actions related to privilege escalation.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: The use of string-stacking and double XOR encoding clearly falls under Defense Evasion, as these are techniques used to evade detection. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after these evasion techniques were used.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing resources, such as malware or infrastructure, to support their operations. While the use of Hi-Zor RAT and its evasion techniques could be part of resource development, the specific actions described (using evasion techniques and then sending data) seem more operational than developmental.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of evasion techniques (string-stacking and double XOR encoding) by Hi-Zor RAT suggests an initial phase of avoiding detection, aligning with "Defense Evasion".
   - After evading detection, the next logical step for the malware would be to communicate with its C2 server or exfiltrate data, which aligns with "Command and Control" when considering the sending of a victim's information.
   - Given the context, "Command and Control" seems the most likely tactic to occur after evasion techniques have been successfully employed and before or as part of the data exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: A**
