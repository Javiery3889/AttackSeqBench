To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before FIN13 used web services and JSP tools to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) Mentioned:**
   - The use of proxies and encoding data for command and control.
   - The use of web services and JSP tools to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

2. **Understand the ATT&CK Tactics Involved:**
   - **Command and Control (B):** This involves establishing a means for the adversary to issue commands to compromised systems or systems used in the attack. The mention of using proxies and encoding data for command and control directly aligns with this tactic.
   - **Exfiltration (C):** This involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. While stealing targeted data for fraudulent transactions is mentioned, this seems to be the goal rather than the step immediately before using web services and JSP tools.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):** This involves gathering information about the target system or network. The question does not directly mention activities typically associated with reconnaissance, such as gathering information about the target before the attack.
   - **Resource Development (A):** This tactic involves the adversary obtaining resources needed to support their operations, such as setting up infrastructure for command and control or obtaining tools. The use of proxies and encoding for command and control could be part of resource development, as it involves setting up the necessary infrastructure for the attack.

3. **Determine the Most Likely Preceding Tactic:**
   - Given that the question mentions the use of proxies and encoding data for command and control before stealing data, we are looking for a tactic that would logically precede these actions. 
   - **Reconnaissance (D)** is a fundamental initial step in many attack sequences, where the adversary gathers information necessary to plan the attack. This would logically precede the setting up of command and control channels and the actual data theft, as understanding the target environment is crucial for a successful attack.
   - **Resource Development (A)** could also be considered, as it involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and tools for the attack. However, the specific mention of using proxies and encoding for command and control suggests that the resources needed for the attack are already being utilized.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described, **Reconnaissance (D)** is the most likely tactic to have occurred before the actions described. Reconnaissance provides the necessary information for planning and executing the subsequent steps of setting up command and control channels and stealing data.

Final Answer: D
