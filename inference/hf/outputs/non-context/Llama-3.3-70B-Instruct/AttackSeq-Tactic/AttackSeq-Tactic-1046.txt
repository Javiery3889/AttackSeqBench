To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before ProjectM actors gained initial access, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that ProjectM actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, using malicious RTF and Excel files as payloads. This indicates the method used for initial access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve gaining initial access, which is a specific tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before this initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Impact**: This tactic involves the attacker's actions after they have gained access and are trying to affect the system or data. It's unlikely to occur before initial access.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This is the tactic that involves gaining an initial foothold on the system. The question specifies that the actors gained initial access through specific methods, so this is the tactic that has already occurred, not the one before it.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves increasing the privileges of the attacker once they have access. It cannot occur before initial access because the attacker needs to be inside the system first.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the preparation and development of resources (like malware, infrastructure) that an adversary uses to conduct attacks. Given that the actors used specific payloads (malicious RTF and Excel files) and tactics (spear-phishing, watering hole attacks), it's reasonable to assume that some form of resource development occurred before these attacks to prepare these tools and methods.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the tactic before initial access.
   - Initial access is the point at which the attacker first gains entry into the system.
   - For an attacker to use specific and prepared payloads and tactics, they must have developed or acquired these resources beforehand.
   - Therefore, the most logical choice that precedes initial access, given the context of using prepared payloads and tactics, is resource development.

**Final Answer: D**
