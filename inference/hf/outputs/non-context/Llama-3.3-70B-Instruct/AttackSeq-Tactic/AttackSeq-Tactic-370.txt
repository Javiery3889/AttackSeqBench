To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before London Blue sent a test email from an attack email account to verify successful delivery as part of their Business Email Compromise (BEC) campaign, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: London Blue is known for conducting BEC campaigns, which typically involve scamming businesses by impersonating high-level executives or other important individuals to trick employees into transferring funds or sensitive information. The tactic of sending a test email to verify successful delivery indicates a preparatory phase where the attackers are ensuring their email account is set up correctly and can reach the intended targets without being blocked or flagged.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs**:
   - **Command and Control (A)**: This tactic involves establishing a channel for controlling compromised systems or sending commands to malware. While important, it doesn't directly relate to the act of setting up an email account for a BEC campaign.
   - **Resource Development (B)**: This tactic involves the creation, purchase, or compromise of resources (like domains, email accounts, or infrastructure) that can be used for future operations. Setting up an email account for sending test emails aligns closely with this tactic, as it involves preparing resources for the campaign.
   - **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network or system. While crucial for many types of cyber attacks, the act of sending a test email from an attack email account doesn't necessarily imply gaining initial access to a target's system.
   - **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security systems. While defense evasion is a common aspect of many attacks, the specific action of sending a test email to verify delivery doesn't directly imply evading defenses at this stage.

3. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - Given the context of setting up and testing an email account for a BEC campaign, the most relevant tactic is **Resource Development (B)**. This is because the attackers are developing the resources (in this case, an email account) necessary for their campaign. The act of sending a test email is part of ensuring these resources are functional and ready for use.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The tactic that most likely occurred before London Blue sent a test email is related to preparing the necessary resources for the attack, which includes setting up and testing the email account.

Final Answer: B
