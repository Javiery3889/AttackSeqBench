To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions that threat actors acquired domain names from multiple registrars and compromised websites. This action is related to setting up or enhancing their malicious infrastructure, which typically involves preparing resources that can be used for various stages of an attack.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves acquiring resources (domain names) and compromising systems (websites), which suggests a preparation phase for potential attacks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target, which might not directly follow the preparation of malicious infrastructure unless the collection is about the infrastructure itself or the targets to be attacked using this infrastructure.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic is about gaining an initial foothold into a network or system. While compromising websites could be a form of initial access, the context provided (acquiring domain names and compromising websites to support malicious infrastructure) suggests a broader preparation phase rather than a specific initial access event.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving within a network after gaining initial access. The preparation of malicious infrastructure (acquiring domain names and compromising websites) does not directly imply movement within a compromised network.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic is about establishing and maintaining infrastructure that can be used for various malicious purposes, such as command and control (C2) servers, phishing sites, or other types of malicious websites. Acquiring domain names and compromising websites to support malicious activities aligns closely with this tactic.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The threat actors' actions (acquiring domain names and compromising websites) are preparatory steps for potential attacks, indicating they are setting up resources for future malicious activities.
   - These actions are most closely related to preparing the infrastructure necessary for conducting attacks, which aligns with the **Resource Development** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the described actions would be related to using these developed resources for malicious purposes, but the question asks for the tactic that "most likely occurred" after these actions, which directly points to the development of resources as the immediate next step.

Final Answer: D
