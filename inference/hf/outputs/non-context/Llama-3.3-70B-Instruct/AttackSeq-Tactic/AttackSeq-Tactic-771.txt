To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically the Darkhotel APT, has already evaded detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors and has encrypted gathered data in log files. The focus is on what tactic most likely occurred as the attacker targeted stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve evading detection (Defense Evasion) and encrypting data. However, the question asks about targeting stored secrets and credentials, which suggests the attacker is looking to gain access to sensitive information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. While lateral movement might be a part of the attack chain, the specific action of targeting stored secrets and credentials for various services doesn't directly imply movement between systems.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: The question mentions that defense evasion has already occurred through the use of digital certificate-signed backdoors. This tactic is about avoiding detection, which has been achieved according to the scenario provided.
   - **C: Persistence**: Persistence involves maintaining access to a system or network. While important for long-term access, the question focuses on the action of targeting and potentially accessing stored credentials, not necessarily maintaining access over time.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining access to credentials like passwords, keys, or other authentication data. Targeting stored secrets and credentials from browsers and email services directly aligns with the goal of obtaining such credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already evaded detection.
   - The focus is on accessing stored secrets and credentials.
   - Credential Access is the tactic most directly related to obtaining such information.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the information and the focus on accessing stored secrets and credentials, the most plausible sequence of TTPs points towards accessing credentials.

Final Answer: D
