To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the exploitation of specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. This exploitation leads to the execution of commands and the installation of an MSI package on the system. The ATT&CK tactic we are looking for is the one that most likely occurred after this exploitation.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The initial step involves exploiting a vulnerability, which allows the attackers to execute commands. This is a form of code execution.
   - The installation of an MSI package further indicates that the attackers are setting up their presence on the system, possibly for persistence or to prepare for further actions.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker's initial entry point into the network. Given that the exploitation of vulnerabilities and command execution have already occurred, the initial access has already been achieved.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on the system. The exploitation of vulnerabilities to execute commands directly aligns with this tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this exploitation.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials that can be used to access systems, data, or services. While credential access might be a subsequent step in an attack to move laterally or escalate privileges, it is not directly implied by the exploitation of vulnerabilities for code execution and MSI package installation.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure that can be used for future operations. Installing an MSI package could be seen as setting up resources for further exploitation or persistence, but this is not the most direct interpretation of "Resource Development" in the context of ATT&CK, which typically refers to activities like setting up command and control (C2) infrastructure or obtaining resources for future campaigns.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The exploitation of vulnerabilities to execute commands indicates that the attackers have already gained access to the system (Initial Access) and are now executing code (Execution).
   - The installation of an MSI package suggests setting up for potential future actions, which could involve persistence, privilege escalation, or moving laterally within the network.
   - Given the choices, **B: Execution** is the tactic that directly aligns with the action of exploiting vulnerabilities to execute commands. However, since the question asks for the tactic that occurred "after" this exploitation, and considering the typical flow of an attack, the next logical step after gaining execution capabilities would indeed involve further actions on the system, such as establishing persistence, escalating privileges, or accessing credentials. Among the provided options, **C: Credential Access** seems like a plausible next step in an attack sequence after initial execution, as attackers often seek to escalate privileges or gain access to more sensitive areas of the system.

**Final Answer: C**
