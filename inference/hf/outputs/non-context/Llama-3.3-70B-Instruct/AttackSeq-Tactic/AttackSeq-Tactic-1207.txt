To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the given information in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions BlueBravo's malware gathering system information (username, computer name, network connections, running processes) and then enabling HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding. The key elements here are the gathering of system information and the establishment of encrypted communication.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - Gathering system information aligns with the **Discovery** tactic, which involves collecting information about the target system or network.
   - Enabling HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding for command and control (C2) purposes aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic, which involves establishing a means for the adversary to communicate with compromised systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the creation, purchase, or compromise of resources such as infrastructure, tools, or personas that can be used to support an operation. While resource development might be necessary for setting up C2 infrastructure, it doesn't directly relate to the act of gathering system information or establishing encrypted communication.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic is about gathering information about the target system or network. The initial action of gathering system information (username, computer name, etc.) fits within this tactic. However, the question asks about enabling HTTPS communication, which goes beyond mere discovery.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a target system. While execution is necessary for the malware to run and gather information, the question focuses on the communication aspect post-execution.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication between the adversary and the compromised system. The use of HTTPS with RC4 and Base64 encoding for encrypted communication directly supports this tactic, especially in the context of maintaining command and control over the compromised system after initial discovery and execution phases.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware's initial action of gathering system information aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.
   - The subsequent action of enabling encrypted HTTPS communication for command and control purposes directly supports the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - Given the question asks which tactic most likely occurred to enable HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding, the focus is on the communication aspect, which is crucial for command and control.

**Final Answer: D**
