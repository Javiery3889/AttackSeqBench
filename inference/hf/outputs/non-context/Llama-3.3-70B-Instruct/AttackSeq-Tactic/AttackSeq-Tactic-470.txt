To determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after spear phishing emails containing infected document files with OLE binary objects were used, let's break down the scenario and analyze the options provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where spear phishing emails with infected documents (containing OLE binary objects) are used to target specific individuals. This action is typically aimed at gaining initial access to the target's system or network.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The use of spear phishing with infected documents is a common technique for gaining initial access. The infected documents, when opened, can execute malicious code, potentially leading to the installation of malware or the creation of a backdoor, which facilitates further malicious activities.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to evade detection and bypass security controls. While defense evasion could occur after initial access, it is not the immediate next step after gaining access through spear phishing.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It could happen before or after initial access, depending on the attacker's goals and the information they already possess. However, it's less directly related to the immediate outcome of opening a malicious document.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves executing malicious code on a compromised system. Given that the spear phishing emails contain infected documents designed to execute malicious code when opened, this tactic aligns closely with the immediate next step after the victim interacts with the phishing email.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining an initial foothold within a network. The use of spear phishing with infected documents is a method of achieving initial access, so this option describes the action that has already occurred, not the next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers sent spear phishing emails with infected documents.
   - The infected documents, when opened, would execute malicious code.
   - The execution of this malicious code is the direct result of the victim's interaction with the phishing email.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the spear phishing emails were used is the execution of the malicious code contained within the infected documents.

**Final Answer: C**
