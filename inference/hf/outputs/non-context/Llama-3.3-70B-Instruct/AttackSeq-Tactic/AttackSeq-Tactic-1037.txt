To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors into tactics and techniques.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions establishing a command and control (C2) connection using a Chinese botnet and a stealth botnet targeting the finance server. This implies that the attackers have already gained some level of access to the target network and are now communicating with their command and control servers.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP (Tactic, Technique, Procedure) mentioned here is the establishment of a command and control connection. In the ATT&CK framework, establishing a C2 channel is a technique (Technique ID T1043: Commonly Used Port, or more broadly under T1071: Application Layer Protocol, among others) under the tactic of "Command and Control."

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. While exfiltration could be a goal of the attackers, the question specifically mentions establishing a C2 connection, not the act of stealing data.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing a means to communicate with compromised systems to control them. The question directly mentions establishing a C2 connection, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target system or network. While collection could occur after establishing a C2 connection, the question does not specifically mention gathering information as the primary action.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary trying to gain knowledge about the system, network, or organization. Like collection, discovery could be a subsequent action but is not directly implied by the establishment of a C2 connection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the establishment of a command and control connection, which is a direct indicator of the "Command and Control" tactic in the ATT&CK framework.
   - The other options, while potentially related to actions that could occur before, during, or after establishing a C2 connection, do not directly match the action described in the question.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred, given the establishment of a C2 connection, is "Command and Control."

Final Answer: B
