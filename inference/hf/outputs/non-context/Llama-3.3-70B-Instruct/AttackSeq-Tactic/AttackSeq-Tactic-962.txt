To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Initial Infection Vector (TONEDEAF)**: The question starts with the execution of a malicious file named "System.doc" as "TONEDEAF," which establishes communication with a Command and Control (C2) server. This suggests an initial infection vector where the attacker gains access to the system, likely through a phishing email or some form of social engineering that tricks the user into opening the malicious document.

2. **Establishment of C2 Communication**: The establishment of communication with a C2 server indicates that the attacker has successfully gained a foothold in the system and is now communicating with their command and control infrastructure. This is typically associated with the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Detection by ExploitGuard**: The question then mentions that FireEye's ExploitGuard detected and prevented an anomaly caused by Microsoft Excel. This implies that after the initial infection, the attacker attempted to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel, which was detected and blocked.

Given this sequence of events, we need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the detection by ExploitGuard. Let's evaluate the options:

- **A: Persistence**: Persistence tactics involve techniques that attackers use to maintain their presence within a system. While persistence is a crucial aspect of an attack, the question focuses on the sequence leading up to the detection of an exploit attempt, not the maintenance of access.

- **B: Reconnaissance**: Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target system or network. This could potentially occur after initial access and before attempting to exploit specific vulnerabilities like the one in Microsoft Excel. However, the question does not directly imply information gathering activities.

- **C: Impact**: Impact tactics are about the attacker's actions to disrupt, corrupt, or destroy data and systems. The detection of an anomaly caused by Microsoft Excel suggests an attempt to exploit, which could be part of causing impact, but the question asks for the tactic before this detection.

- **D: Defense Evasion**: Defense evasion tactics involve techniques used by attackers to evade detection and bypass security controls. Given that the attacker attempted to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel after establishing C2 communication, and this attempt was detected, it's plausible that defense evasion techniques were employed to try and avoid detection before the exploit attempt was made.

Considering the sequence of events and the nature of the detection, the most likely tactic that occurred before the detection by ExploitGuard is an attempt to evade defenses to maintain stealth and successfully exploit the vulnerability.

Final Answer: D
