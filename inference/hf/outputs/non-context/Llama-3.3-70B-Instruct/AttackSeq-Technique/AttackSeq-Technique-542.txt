To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after OceanLotus decrypted and loaded additional data using DLL Side-Loading but before executing shellcode extracted from resource data for persistence, let's analyze the given sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which can then execute the malicious code. This is a method used for defense evasion and execution.

2. **Executing shellcode extracted from resource data for persistence**: This implies that the attacker is looking to maintain access to the system by executing code that will allow them to come back or remain in the system even after a reboot or other system changes.

Given these points, the sequence suggests the attacker is moving from initial execution and evasion (DLL Side-Loading) towards establishing persistence (executing shellcode for persistence).

Let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication. While it could be part of the attack chain, it doesn't directly fit between DLL Side-Loading and executing shellcode for persistence in terms of logical sequence for establishing a foothold.

B. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique is about hiding artifacts to evade detection, which could indeed happen after initial execution (like DLL Side-Loading) to avoid being detected before establishing persistence. However, it's more about evasion rather than a direct step towards executing shellcode for persistence.

C. **T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**: This involves modifying kernel callback tables, which is a sophisticated technique for persistence and evasion. However, it's more specific to kernel-level modifications and might not directly follow DLL Side-Loading in a straightforward attack sequence aimed at executing shellcode for persistence.

D. **T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which aligns closely with the concept of executing shellcode. Given that the attacker has already used DLL Side-Loading (a form of code execution), injecting portable executable code could be a logical next step before or as part of executing shellcode for persistence, as it allows for the execution of malicious code within a legitimate process.

Considering the logical flow from executing malicious code via DLL Side-Loading to establishing persistence through shellcode execution, **T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection** seems the most directly related technique that would occur in this sequence. It aligns with the goal of executing malicious code within a process, which can lead to persistence.

Final Answer: D
