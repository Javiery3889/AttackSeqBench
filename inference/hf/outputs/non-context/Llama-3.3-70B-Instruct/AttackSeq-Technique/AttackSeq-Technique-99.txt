To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Bitter APT group utilized a phishing campaign with malicious documents, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Attack Vector**: The Bitter APT group started with a phishing campaign that included malicious documents. This is a common initial attack vector used to gain access to a target's system or network. The technique used here aligns with **T1566-Phishing**, but since this is the initial step mentioned in the question, we're looking for what likely happened next.

2. **Objective of the Phishing Campaign**: The goal of such campaigns is often to trick victims into opening malicious documents or clicking on links that lead to malware downloads, credential theft, or other malicious activities. Given that the target was high-ranking officers, the attackers likely aimed to gain access to sensitive information or systems.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the attacker's IP address. While proxies can be used at various stages of an attack, including after initial access for command and control (C2) communications, it's not directly related to the immediate actions following a successful phishing campaign with malicious documents.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique already used by the Bitter APT group as the initial attack vector, so it's not what happened after.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**: After gaining initial access through phishing, attackers often try to obtain valid accounts to move laterally within the network, maintain access, or escalate privileges. This technique is a plausible next step after a successful phishing campaign, especially if the phishing aimed at obtaining login credentials or if the malicious documents were designed to capture such information.
   - **D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**: This technique involves modifying file associations to execute malicious code. While it could be part of an attack chain, it's more specific to scenarios where the attacker is trying to execute malware by exploiting the way operating systems handle file types, which doesn't directly follow from the described phishing campaign without additional context on the malicious documents' behavior.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of a phishing campaign targeting high-ranking officers with the likely goal of gaining access to sensitive information or systems, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence would involve attempting to use obtained credentials or create new accounts to move within the network. Thus, **T1078-Valid Accounts** is the most logical next technique in the sequence described.

Final Answer: C
