To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker, referred to as "Longhorn," has established communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers. This communication utilizes a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - The key detail here is the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication with C&C servers, which implies an effort to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage**: This technique involves storing data in the Registry or in memory to avoid detection. While it's a method to avoid detection, it doesn't directly relate to the communication process with C&C servers.
   - **B & C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves transferring data to or from a system in a way that is scheduled or periodic. Although it could be part of the communication strategy, it doesn't specifically address the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for maintaining operational security.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect the C2 channel, which directly aligns with the scenario described. The use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication with C&C servers implies the creation of an encrypted channel to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of the question, which are the establishment of communication with C&C servers and the use of a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze each answer choice in the context of these key elements.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for C&C communication is most directly related to creating an encrypted channel.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the details in the question, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique that aligns with the scenario described is the one related to creating an encrypted channel for communication.

Final Answer: D
