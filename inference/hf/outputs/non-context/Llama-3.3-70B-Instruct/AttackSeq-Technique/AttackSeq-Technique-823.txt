To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FIN4, presumably a threat actor group, captures user credentials through spearphishing emails that contain embedded VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros.
   - The use of spearphishing emails with VBA macros is a common technique for initial access, aiming to trick users into enabling macros that execute malicious code, potentially leading to the installation of malware or the direct capture of credentials.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step involves spearphishing, which aligns with the technique **T1566-Phishing**. However, this technique is not listed among the answer choices. We need to focus on what happens after the initial phishing attempt, specifically the capture of user credentials.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1528-Steal Application Access Token**: This technique involves stealing access tokens used for authentication, which could be a subsequent step after initial access but doesn't directly relate to the capture of credentials through spearphishing with VBA macros.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which could include keystrokes or other input methods. Given that the spearphishing emails aim to capture user credentials, this could be a plausible next step if the malware installed through the VBA macros includes a keylogger or similar input capture functionality.
   - **C: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This sub-technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to gain access to sensitive information. While related to email, it doesn't directly align with the capture of credentials through spearphishing.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the capture of user credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The scenario starts with spearphishing emails containing VBA macros, aiming to capture user credentials.
   - The most direct technique related to capturing credentials (especially in the context of user interaction like entering credentials) after such an initial access method would be **input capture**.
   - While the other options could be part of a broader campaign, they don't directly align with the immediate action of capturing credentials through the described method.

**Final Answer: B**
