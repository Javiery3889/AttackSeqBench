To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after evading defenses using obfuscation and sandbox detection, RogueRobin established communication with Command and Control (C2) servers using a custom DNS tunneling protocol. The key elements here are the use of a custom DNS tunneling protocol for C2 communication.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves evasion techniques (obfuscation and sandbox detection) followed by establishing C2 communication. The specific technique we're focused on involves using a custom DNS tunneling protocol for this communication.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071.004-DNS**: This refers to a specific sub-technique under "Application Layer Protocol" where DNS is used for C2 communication. Given that the question specifies the use of a custom DNS tunneling protocol, this seems directly relevant.
   - **B: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**: This technique involves modifying the PATH environment variable to intercept and execute commands. It does not directly relate to the use of DNS tunneling for C2 communication.
   - **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: While this technique does involve tunneling, it is more general and does not specifically mention DNS. However, it could encompass DNS tunneling, but it's broader than what's described.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information. It does not relate to the technical details of establishing C2 communication via DNS tunneling.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of a custom DNS tunneling protocol for C2 communication.
   - T1071.004-DNS directly addresses the use of DNS for C2 communication, which aligns with the details provided in the question.
   - While T1572-Protocol Tunneling could be relevant because it involves tunneling, T1071.004-DNS is more specific to the use of DNS.
   - T1574.007 and T1566 are not relevant to the scenario described.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the specific mention of a custom DNS tunneling protocol for C2 communication, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique is the one that directly involves using DNS for this purpose.

Final Answer: A
