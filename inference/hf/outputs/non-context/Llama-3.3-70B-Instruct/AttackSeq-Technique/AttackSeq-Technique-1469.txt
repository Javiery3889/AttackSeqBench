To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation. This is a known vulnerability that allows an attacker to escalate privileges on a system. After this exploitation, the attacker wants to ensure the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup. The question specifically asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred between the exploitation and conducting discovery using GitHub gists.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Exploiting a vulnerability for Local Privilege Escalation (CVE-2015-1701).
   - Ensuring a backdoor (SLUB) remains active upon system startup.
   - Conducting discovery using GitHub gists.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1556.006 - Multi-Factor Authentication**: This technique involves bypassing or compromising multi-factor authentication mechanisms, which does not directly relate to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.
   - **B: T1546.010 - AppInit DLLs**: This technique involves loading a DLL into a process at startup, which could potentially be used to maintain persistence but is more specific to loading DLLs into processes rather than ensuring a backdoor remains active at system startup.
   - **C: T1113 - Screen Capture**: This technique is related to capturing screenshots, which does not fit the context of maintaining a backdoor's activity upon system startup.
   - **D: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically when a system boots up or a user logs on, which directly aligns with ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already escalated privileges using CVE-2015-1701.
   - The goal is to keep the SLUB backdoor active when the system starts up.
   - Among the given options, the technique that directly supports maintaining persistence and ensuring the backdoor remains active upon system startup is related to autostart execution.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate technique for ensuring the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup, after exploiting CVE-2015-1701 and before conducting discovery, is related to autostart execution mechanisms.

Final Answer: D
