To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions APT28, a known advanced persistent threat group, and their use of a backdoor component named "advstoreshell.dll". This backdoor is indicated in a configuration file during data collection, suggesting that the attackers are using it for communication. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated secure communication with their Command and Control (C&C) servers.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the deployment of a backdoor (advstoreshell.dll) and the need for secure communication with C&C servers. The backdoor itself is a tool used for persistence and possibly for establishing a communication channel, but the question specifically asks about the technique used for secure communication.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to hide malicious activity. While it could be related to persistence or evasion, it doesn't directly imply secure communication.
   - **B: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This involves using standard web protocols for C&C communication, which could be part of the communication process but doesn't inherently imply security.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves creating an encrypted channel for C&C communications, which directly addresses the need for secure communication.
   - **D: T1218.014-MMC**: This doesn't directly relate to the context provided, as it's more about exploiting Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for execution, not about secure communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the secure communication aspect after deploying a backdoor.
   - Secure communication implies the need to protect the data being transmitted between the compromised host and the C&C servers.
   - Among the given options, the technique that directly addresses the establishment of a secure communication channel is the creation of an encrypted channel.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of needing secure communication with C&C servers after deploying a backdoor, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique is the one that involves encrypting the communication channel to prevent interception or eavesdropping.

Final Answer: C
