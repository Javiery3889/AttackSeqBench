To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Turla established a hidden foothold in infected networks for persistent access and before its operators downloaded specialized tools for gathering information and stealing documents, let's analyze the given options in the context of the attack sequence described:

1. **Establishing a hidden foothold** implies that the attackers have gained initial access and are now looking to maintain persistence and possibly evade detection. This step is about ensuring they can come back and continue their operations without being noticed.

2. **Before downloading specialized tools** for gathering information and stealing documents, the attackers would likely want to ensure their foothold is secure, and they have the necessary access and capabilities to support the deployment of these tools.

Let's evaluate the options:

A. **T1036.004 - Masquerade Task or Service**: This technique involves disguising a malicious task or service as a legitimate one to avoid detection. This could be a plausible step after establishing a foothold, as it would help in maintaining persistence by making malicious activities appear legitimate.

B. **T1074.002 - Remote Data Staging**: This involves staging data in a remote location, often in preparation for exfiltration. While data staging could be part of the attack sequence, it seems more related to the actions taken after gathering information rather than immediately after establishing persistence and before downloading tools.

C. **T1115 - Clipboard Data**: This technique involves capturing clipboard contents, which could be useful for gathering information but seems more specific to certain types of data theft rather than a general step in establishing a secure foothold or preparing for tool deployment.

D. **T1014 - Rootkit**: A rootkit is a tool used to hide malicious software from the operating system. Installing a rootkit could indeed help in maintaining a hidden foothold by hiding the presence of malicious tools and activities from system administrators and security software.

Given the context, the most likely technique to occur after establishing a hidden foothold and before downloading specialized tools would be one that enhances persistence and evasion capabilities. Between the options provided, **T1014 - Rootkit** seems the most directly related to ensuring a hidden foothold is maintained by hiding malicious activities and tools from detection, which would be crucial before introducing additional tools for information gathering and document theft.

Final Answer: D
