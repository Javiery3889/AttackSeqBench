To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that APT28, a known advanced persistent threat group, has ensured persistence by altering the timestamps of files downloaded by the second stage dropper. This action is aimed at concealing these files from potential discovery by victims who might be looking for newly created files on the disk. The technique of altering timestamps to hide malicious activity is a form of indicator removal, which aligns with the concept of hiding evidence of malicious activity.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - Ensuring persistence: This implies that the attacker has already gained access and is looking to maintain that access over time.
   - Altering timestamps: A specific action taken to conceal evidence of the malicious files, which is a form of indicator removal.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. While encryption is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their communications, it doesn't directly relate to the action of altering file timestamps to conceal files.
   - **B: T1218.013-Mavinject**: This technique involves injecting code into a running process. It's a method of executing malicious code in the context of a legitimate process, but it doesn't directly follow from altering timestamps to hide files.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise (IOCs) from a system to avoid detection. Altering timestamps of malicious files to make them blend in with older files is a form of indicator removal, making this a likely next step after ensuring persistence.
   - **D: T1546.017-Udev Rules**: This technique involves creating or modifying udev rules to execute commands or programs when specific events occur. While it's a method of persistence, it doesn't directly relate to the action of hiding files by altering their timestamps.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The action described (altering timestamps) is directly related to hiding evidence of malicious activity.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique that aligns with this action is indicator removal, as it involves removing or altering indicators that might lead to the detection of malicious activity.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after altering timestamps to conceal files is related to further hiding or removing indicators of compromise.

**Final Answer: C**
