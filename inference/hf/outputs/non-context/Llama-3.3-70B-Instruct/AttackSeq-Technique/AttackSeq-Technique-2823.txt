To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Hacking Team's spyware gained initial access, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access Method**: The spyware gained initial access by disguising an executable file as a PDF document and was delivered via a spearphishing email. This already indicates that the initial access vector involved deception and social engineering, specifically targeting individuals with emails that appeared legitimate but contained malicious content.

2. **Analyzing Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising a piece of malware or a malicious file to look like a legitimate file. Given that the spyware was disguised as a PDF document, this technique aligns closely with the initial access method described. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred *after* gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique used for the initial access (spearphishing email), so it's not what happened after gaining access.
   - **C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves injecting malware into a legitimate process, which could be a plausible next step after initial access to maintain persistence and evade detection. It's a method that could be used after the malware has been executed on the victim's system.
   - **D: T1647-Plist File Modification**: This technique is related to modifying Plist files, typically on macOS systems, to achieve persistence. While it's a post-compromise technique, the initial access method described doesn't specifically suggest macOS or the need to modify Plist files as the immediate next step.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial access was gained through spearphishing, which aligns with **T1566-Phishing**, but this is not what we're looking for since we need the technique that occurred afterward.
   - **T1036-Masquerading** was part of the initial access method, not a subsequent action.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing** is a technique that could plausibly follow initial access, as it's a method to hide malicious code within legitimate processes, aiding in persistence and evasion.
   - **T1647-Plist File Modification** seems less directly related to the immediate actions following the described initial access method, especially without specific context indicating the target system is macOS.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of gaining initial access through disguising malware as a PDF and delivering it via spearphishing, and considering the need for the malware to establish a foothold on the system, **T1055.012-Process Hollowing** appears to be the most plausible next step. This technique would help the malware to blend in with normal system activity, making it harder to detect.

Final Answer: C
