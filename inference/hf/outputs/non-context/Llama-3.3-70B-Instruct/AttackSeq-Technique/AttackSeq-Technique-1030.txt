To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the use of HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (C2) by Gamaredon's modules. It specifically highlights the action of automatically uploading harvested documents to the C&C server. This action implies data exfiltration, which is the process of transferring sensitive data from a target system to an external system or attacker-controlled server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP here involves the exfiltration of data (harvested documents) over the established command and control channel. The techniques mentioned in the answer choices need to be evaluated in the context of this data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves restricting the size of data transfers to avoid detection. While it could be relevant in certain contexts of data exfiltration, it doesn't directly describe the act of exfiltrating data itself.
   - **B: T1137.006-Add-ins**: This involves using add-ins (like Microsoft Office add-ins) for persistence or execution. It doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique directly involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the scenario described. The use of HTTP and HTTPS for C2, followed by the upload of harvested documents, fits this technique.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system or applications. While it could be used in various phases of an attack, it doesn't specifically describe the act of exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes the exfiltration of harvested documents over an established C2 channel.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this action is the one that directly involves exfiltrating data over such a channel.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is the technique that matches this description.
   
Final Answer: C
