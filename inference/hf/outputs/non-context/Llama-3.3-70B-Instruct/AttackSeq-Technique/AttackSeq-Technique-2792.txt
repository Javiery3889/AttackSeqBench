To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already compromised an iOS device and is now looking to facilitate communication with a Command and Control (C2) server. The methods of communication mentioned are POST and GET requests, which are common HTTP methods used for sending and receiving data over the internet.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the compromised iOS device, the need to communicate with a C2 server, and the use of HTTP requests (POST and GET). The technique we're looking for should involve establishing or utilizing network communication for C2 purposes.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1557.002 - ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. While it's a network-based attack, it doesn't directly relate to communicating with a C2 server using HTTP requests.
   - **B: T1102 - Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C2 communication. Given that web services often use HTTP methods like POST and GET for communication, this seems like a plausible choice.
   - **C: T1518 - Software Discovery**: This technique is about discovering software on a system, which doesn't directly relate to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **D: T1001.001 - Junk Data**: This sub-technique involves sending junk data to a system, which doesn't fit the context of using HTTP requests for C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has compromised an iOS device and needs to communicate with a C2 server.
   - The communication method involves HTTP requests (POST and GET), which are commonly used in web services.
   - Among the given options, **T1102 - Web Service** is the technique that most closely aligns with using HTTP requests for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B**
