To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before APT41 moved laterally within targeted networks, we need to consider the actions involved in lateral movement and the prerequisites for such actions.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes APT41's actions of moving laterally within targeted networks. This includes pivoting between Windows and Linux systems until they access game production environments. Lateral movement (T1021) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves moving from one system to another within a network. However, before an adversary can move laterally, they typically need to have some knowledge of the network layout and the systems within it.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP mentioned here is lateral movement, but the question asks for the technique that likely occurred before this movement. Techniques that involve discovery or reconnaissance are typically precursors to lateral movement because they provide the necessary information about the network and its systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems, which could be relevant but is more about identifying systems that can be accessed remotely rather than understanding the internal network layout.
   - **B: T1218.002-Control Panel**: This is not directly related to the initial steps of network discovery or reconnaissance that would precede lateral movement.
   - **C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique directly involves gathering information about the victim's network, which would be essential for planning and executing lateral movement. It includes activities like network mapping and identifying potential targets within the network.
   - **D: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**: While relevant for cloud environments, the question does not specifically limit the scenario to cloud services, and lateral movement described involves both Windows and Linux systems, not exclusively cloud services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Lateral movement within a network requires prior knowledge of the network's structure and potential targets.
   - Gathering victim network information (T1590) is a technique that directly supports the acquisition of this necessary knowledge.
   - The other options either are less directly related to the prerequisite knowledge gathering for lateral movement or are more specific to certain environments (like cloud services) that are not the focus of the question.

**Final Answer: C**
