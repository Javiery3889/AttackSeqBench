To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the attack began with emails impersonating Mexico's tax department, we need to analyze the initial steps of the attack and how they typically progress.

1. **Initial Attack Vector**: The attack starts with phishing emails that impersonate Mexico's tax department. This is a common social engineering tactic used to trick victims into performing a certain action, in this case, downloading a malicious attachment.

2. **Malicious Attachment**: The download and execution of the malicious attachment initiate the attack chain. This action likely leads to the installation of malware on the victim's system.

3. **Post-Compromise Techniques**: After the initial compromise, attackers typically seek to gather information about the victim's environment, escalate privileges, or move laterally within the network.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1187-Forced Authentication**: This technique involves forcing a user to authenticate to a captured network resource, which might not directly follow the initial compromise via a malicious email attachment.

- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: After gaining initial access, attackers often try to gather more information about the victim, including identity information. This could involve collecting data from the compromised system or network and aligns well with post-compromise activities.

- **C: T1114-Email Collection**: While collecting emails can be a goal of an attack, it is more specific to gathering sensitive information and might not be the immediate next step after the initial compromise.

- **D: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies**: This sub-technique involves exploiting trust in a network, such as exploiting a trusted relationship between systems. While it's a possible post-compromise activity, it might not be the most direct or immediate next step after initial access via a malicious attachment.

Considering the typical progression of an attack and the need for attackers to understand their newly gained foothold, **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** seems the most plausible next step. This technique aligns with the attackers' need to gather intelligence on the compromised system or network to plan further actions, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
