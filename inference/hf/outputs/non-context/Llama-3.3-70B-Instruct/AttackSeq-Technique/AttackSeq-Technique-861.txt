To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary group, TG-3279, has already gained access to a network, is using specific tools (Conpee or Etso), and has added scheduled system tasks using compromised credentials obtained via pwdump6. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated Command and Control (C2) communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves initial access, credential compromise (using pwdump6), and establishing a C2 channel. The key detail here is the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which implies using a standard port in a non-standard way to potentially evade detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This technique involves using mail protocols for C2 communication, which doesn't directly relate to using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning**: Active scanning is about gathering information about the target environment, not about establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. However, the question specifies the use of port 443, which is a standard port for HTTPS, but being used in a non-standard way (for non-HTTPS traffic).
   - **D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**: This technique is about acquiring infrastructure for C2, which doesn't directly address the method of communication (using a specific port in a non-standard way).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which indicates a standard port being used in a non-standard manner for C2 communication.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique that aligns with using a standard port (like 443) in a non-standard way for C2 would be related to the concept of using non-standard ports or protocols for communication. However, the provided options don't directly mention using standard ports in non-standard ways.
   - Given the choices, **T1571-Non-Standard Port** seems to be the closest in context because it's about using ports in a way that could avoid detection, even though it typically refers to using ports that are not standard for the protocol in question. The use of port 443 (a standard HTTPS port) for non-HTTPS traffic could be seen as a form of non-standard usage, aiming to blend in with legitimate traffic.

5. **Final Answer**: 
Given the context and the available choices, the best fit seems to be the technique related to using ports in a manner that could help evade detection, even though the direct reference is to non-standard ports. However, it's crucial to note that the perfect match based on the description (using a standard port for non-standard traffic) isn't explicitly listed as an option. The closest in spirit, given the aim of evading detection and the provided options, would be:

**Final Answer: C**
