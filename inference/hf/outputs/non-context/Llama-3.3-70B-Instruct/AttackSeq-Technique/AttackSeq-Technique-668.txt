To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the CopyKittens attack group's use of specific techniques as part of their multi-stage infection framework. These techniques include the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution to prevent detection. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned involve evasion and anti-analysis tactics. The use of a global mutex can be related to ensuring only one instance of malware runs on a system, and runtime API address resolution can help in dynamically resolving API addresses, potentially to evade static analysis or detection mechanisms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1070.007 - Clear Network Connection History and Configurations**: This technique involves clearing network connection history and configurations, which could be a step to cover tracks but doesn't directly relate to the evasion techniques mentioned.
   - **T1001 - Data Obfuscation**: Data obfuscation is a technique used to make data difficult to understand, which aligns with the intent of preventing detection but is more about the data itself rather than the execution or evasion of the malware.
   - **T1547.012 - Print Processors**: This technique is related to accessing or manipulating print processors, which doesn't directly follow from the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution in terms of evasion or anti-analysis.
   - **T1622 - Debugger Evasion**: Debugger evasion techniques are used to prevent a debugger from attaching to a process or to detect and evade debuggers. Given the context of using a global mutex and runtime API address resolution for evasion, this technique aligns closely as it also pertains to evading detection and analysis.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution indicates the malware is designed to evade detection and possibly analysis.
   - The next logical step in such a sequence, aimed at preventing detection, would involve further evasion techniques.
   - Among the given options, **T1622 - Debugger Evasion** directly relates to evasion and anti-analysis, making it a plausible next step after the mentioned techniques.

**Final Answer: D**
