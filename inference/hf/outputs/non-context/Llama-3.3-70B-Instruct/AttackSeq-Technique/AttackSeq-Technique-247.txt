To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the execution of CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' for evading detection. This indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity by masquerading as a legitimate process, which is a common technique used by attackers to evade detection by security software. The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next to maintain persistence through repeated executions of the downloaded payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial action involves disguising CertUtil.exe, which is often used for downloading or manipulating files, suggesting the attacker has already gained some level of access to the system and is looking to establish persistence. The next step in the sequence should logically involve maintaining access or ensuring the payload (likely malicious) continues to execute over time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While it could be part of an attack sequence for command and control (C2) communication, it doesn't directly relate to maintaining persistence through repeated executions of a payload.
   - **B: T1505.003-Web Shell**: Web shells are used for remote access to a compromised web server. This technique doesn't directly align with the scenario of executing a downloaded payload repeatedly for persistence on a potentially non-web server system.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task or job to execute at a specific time or interval, which directly supports the goal of maintaining persistence by ensuring repeated execution of a malicious payload.
   - **D: T1583.007-Serverless**: Serverless applications are a type of cloud service, and while they can be used in various malicious ways, they don't directly fit the scenario of executing a payload on a compromised system for persistence in the way described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already evaded detection by disguising CertUtil.exe.
   - The goal now is to maintain persistence, which means ensuring the malicious payload continues to run.
   - Among the given options, scheduling a task or job (T1053) directly supports this goal by allowing the attacker to specify when and how often the payload should be executed, thereby maintaining persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
