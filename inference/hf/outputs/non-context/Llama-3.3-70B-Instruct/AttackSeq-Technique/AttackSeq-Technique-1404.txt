To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Spear Phishing Emails (CVE-2015-2545):** The attack starts with exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2015-2545) via spear phishing emails. This indicates the initial access technique is T1566 - Phishing, specifically spear phishing, which is a subset of phishing.

2. **Achieving Persistence using an ActiveSetup Registry Key:** After gaining initial access, the attackers achieve persistence using an ActiveSetup registry key. This action aligns with the technique T1546 - Event Triggered Execution, but since it's not listed among the choices, we focus on the next step in the sequence which involves communication with the attacker's infrastructure.

3. **Communication with Attacker's Infrastructure:** The question asks about the technique most likely used to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure after achieving persistence. Let's evaluate the answer choices in this context:

   - **A: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. Given that the attackers have already gained access and achieved persistence, using an application layer protocol (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for C2 communication is a common and plausible next step.
   
   - **B: T1548 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique is related to abusing elevation control mechanisms to gain higher privileges, which doesn't directly relate to communicating with the attacker's infrastructure.
   
   - **C: T1566 - Phishing:** This is the initial access technique and not relevant to the communication phase after persistence has been established.
   
   - **D: T1090.001 - Internal Proxy:** While proxying could be used for communication, the specific mention of "internal" might not directly apply to communicating with external attacker infrastructure without further context on internal proxy usage for external C2.

Given the context and the need for the attackers to communicate with their infrastructure after establishing persistence, the most likely technique for this purpose would involve using existing protocols that can bypass traditional network monitoring, such as those at the application layer.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Identify the initial access vector and persistence method.
2. Determine the need for communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
3. Evaluate each answer choice against the context of communicating with external infrastructure.
4. Select the choice that best aligns with common tactics for command and control communication.

**Final Answer: A**
