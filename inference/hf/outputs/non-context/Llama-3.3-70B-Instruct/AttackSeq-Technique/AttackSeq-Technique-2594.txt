To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions the use of 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion, which implies the malware is trying to hide or protect itself from being detected.
   - After evasion, the malware gathers detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The first TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) mentioned is defense evasion using 'Enigma Protector'.
   - The second action is gathering system information, specifically network configurations and active TCP connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. It does not directly relate to gathering system information like network configurations and TCP connections after defense evasion.
   - **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the network connections of the system they are targeting. This could include active TCP connections and network configurations, aligning with the described action after defense evasion.
   - **C: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**: This technique is focused on discovering cloud infrastructure, which does not directly align with gathering detailed system information such as network configurations and active TCP connections on a local system.
   - **D: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**: This technique involves modifying autostart entries to maintain persistence. While it's a post-compromise technique, it doesn't directly relate to gathering system network information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where, after evading defenses, the malware collects detailed system information.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for gathering system information, specifically network configurations and active TCP connections, is **System Network Connections Discovery**.
   - This technique directly aligns with the actions described in the question, making it the most plausible next step in the attack sequence.

Final Answer: B
