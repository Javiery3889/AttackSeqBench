To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, before gaining initial access, needs to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities. The initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails with malicious documents exploiting CVE vulnerabilities. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique most likely used for gathering this information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves gathering information about targets before launching a spear-phishing campaign. This implies the attacker needs to know something about the potential victims to craft effective spear-phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves establishing fallback channels for command and control (C2) in case the primary channel is compromised. It doesn't directly relate to gathering information about targets before initial access.
   - **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This involves scanning IP blocks to gather information about potential targets, which could be relevant but is more about network reconnaissance than specifically gathering information about entities.
   - **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique directly involves collecting information about the identities of potential victims, which can include names, positions, contact information, etc. This is crucial for crafting targeted spear-phishing emails.
   - **D: T1074-Data Staged**: This technique is about staging data in a location that can be accessed by the attacker, typically after initial access has been gained, not before.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique used before gaining initial access, specifically for gathering information about targets.
   - The most relevant technique for this purpose is gathering information that can be used to identify and target specific individuals or entities.
   - Among the given options, **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is the most directly related to this goal, as it involves collecting information about potential victims, which is essential for a targeted attack like spear-phishing.

**Final Answer: C**
