To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the WinDealer malware loading a DLL module into memory. This action is followed by the encryption and staging of stolen information in the %TEMP% directory under the ".a" file extension. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Identifying Relevant Techniques**:
   - **T1546.002 - Screensaver**: This technique involves using a screensaver to hide malicious activity. It doesn't directly relate to loading DLLs or encrypting/staging data.
   - **T1564 - Hide Artifacts**: This technique is about hiding artifacts to evade detection. While it could be relevant in a broader context of malware operation, it's not directly linked to the specific actions of loading a DLL and then encrypting/staging data.
   - **T1059.010 - AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This involves using automation tools to execute malicious code. While it could be a method for executing malware, it doesn't directly relate to the described sequence of loading a DLL and then encrypting data.
   - **T1129 - Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules (like DLLs) to execute code. Given that the question mentions loading a DLL module into memory, this technique directly aligns with the initial action described.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The key detail in the question is the loading of a DLL module into memory. This action is a strong indicator of the use of shared modules to execute malicious code, which aligns with **T1129 - Shared Modules**.
   - The subsequent actions of encrypting and staging stolen information could be part of the malware's operation after it has been loaded and executed, potentially using the loaded DLL for these purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   1. The question specifies the loading of a DLL, which is a direct indicator of using shared modules.
   2. The use of shared modules (T1129) is a technique that would occur before the malware can perform its intended functions, such as encrypting and staging data.
   3. The other options, while potentially relevant in a broader context of malware operations, do not directly precede the actions of encrypting and staging data in the way that loading a shared module (DLL) does.

**Final Answer: D**
