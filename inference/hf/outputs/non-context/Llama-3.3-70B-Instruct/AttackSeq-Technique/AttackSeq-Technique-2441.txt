To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions Mustang Panda fetching additional shellcode from a C2 (Command and Control) IP address to execute on infected endpoints. This action is part of the Command and Control operations, indicating the attackers are already inside the network and are looking to expand their control or execute further malicious activities. The question specifically asks about the technique that most likely occurred to deploy the PlugX implant during these operations.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the deployment of the PlugX implant and the fetching of additional shellcode from a C2 IP address. PlugX is a type of malware used by various threat actors, including Mustang Panda, for remote access and control. The deployment of such malware typically involves transferring the malware tool into the victim's network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-standard protocols for communication, which could be relevant in some contexts of command and control but doesn't directly relate to the deployment of malware like PlugX.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique is about scheduling tasks on a compromised system to execute at a later time, which could be used for persistence but doesn't directly address the deployment of the malware.
   - **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools within a compromised network, which could apply to moving the PlugX implant within the network but doesn't specifically address the initial deployment from outside the network.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique is about transferring tools into a compromised network, which aligns with the deployment of the PlugX implant from a C2 server into the victim's network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the deployment of the PlugX implant as part of Command and Control operations.
   - The deployment of malware like PlugX from a C2 server into a victim's network is a critical step in establishing control.
   - The technique must involve the transfer of the malware into the network, which is a key aspect of the attack sequence described.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for deploying the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations involves transferring the tool into the compromised network. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred is related to the ingress of tools into the network.

Final Answer: D
