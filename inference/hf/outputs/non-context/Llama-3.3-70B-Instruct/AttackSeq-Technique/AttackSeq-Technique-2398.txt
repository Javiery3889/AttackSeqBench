To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions TDrop2, a malware, evading detection through process hollowing and disguising payload retrieval. This indicates the malware is attempting to hide its activities and gather information without being detected.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involves evasion techniques, suggesting the malware is trying to operate stealthily.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The malware uses process hollowing for defense evasion, which is a technique to hide malicious code within a legitimate process.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to gather details about the infected system after evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system, which could be used for various purposes, including gathering system information. However, it's more about the method of interaction rather than the specific goal of system information gathering.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique directly involves gathering information about the system, such as its configuration, architecture, and other details. This would be a logical step after evasion to understand the environment the malware is operating in.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: While this is another evasion technique, it's more focused on detecting and evading virtualization and sandbox environments rather than gathering system information.
   - **D: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This involves archiving data, which doesn't directly relate to the immediate goal of gathering system details post-evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already evaded detection, indicating it's past the initial stages of infection and is now likely looking to understand its environment.
   - To effectively operate, spread, or exfiltrate data, the malware needs to gather information about the system it's infecting.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery** directly aligns with this goal, as it involves techniques used to gather information about the target system.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of the malware evading detection and the need to understand the system it's operating on, the most plausible next step in the sequence of TTPs would be to gather system information.

Final Answer: B
