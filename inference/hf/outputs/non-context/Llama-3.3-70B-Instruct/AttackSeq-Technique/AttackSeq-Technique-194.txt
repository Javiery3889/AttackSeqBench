To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after FamousSparrow utilized cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor in the Execution phase, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The Execution phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves techniques that allow an adversary to execute code on a remote system. The use of cmd.exe for downloading and installing a backdoor (SparrowDoor) indicates that the adversary has already gained access to the system and is now executing commands to establish persistence and possibly elevate privileges.

2. **Analyzing the Techniques**:
   - **T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. Given that the backdoor has already been installed, this technique would have occurred before the Execution phase mentioned.
   - **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access. Like spearphishing, this would typically be an initial access technique rather than something that occurs after a backdoor has been installed.
   - **T1134 - Access Token Manipulation**: This technique is used to manipulate access tokens to elevate privileges or maintain access. After installing a backdoor, an adversary might use this technique to ensure they can maintain access or move laterally within the network without being detected.
   - **T1597 - Search Closed Sources**: This technique involves searching closed sources (like internal networks or systems) for sensitive information. While this could be a post-exploitation activity, it's more related to the Discovery phase rather than a direct follow-up to installing a backdoor.

3. **Determining the Most Likely Technique**:
   - Given that the SparrowDoor backdoor has been installed, the next logical steps for the adversary would involve maintaining access, elevating privileges, or moving laterally within the network. Among the provided options, **T1134 - Access Token Manipulation** is the most directly related to these goals. It would allow the adversary to manipulate access tokens, potentially elevating their privileges or ensuring they can use the installed backdoor effectively without detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the current phase and action: Execution phase with cmd.exe used for downloading and installing a backdoor.
2. Consider the goals post-backdoor installation: Maintaining access, elevating privileges, or moving laterally.
3. Match these goals with the provided ATT&CK techniques.
4. Select the technique that best aligns with these post-installation goals.

**Final Answer**: C
