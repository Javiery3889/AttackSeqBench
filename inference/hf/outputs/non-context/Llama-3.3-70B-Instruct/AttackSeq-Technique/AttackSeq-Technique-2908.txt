To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions APT15 deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistent communication over DNS. Before this deployment, the attackers needed to gain remote access to the network. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated this remote access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are gaining remote access and the subsequent deployment of a backdoor (RoyalDNS) for persistent communication. The initial access could involve various techniques, but given the context, we're looking for a method that would allow attackers to remotely access the network before establishing a more permanent backdoor.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This involves using local accounts to gain access. While local accounts can be used for lateral movement or privilege escalation, they might not be the primary method for initial remote access without prior compromise.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a network. This could include services like VPNs, Citrix, or other remote access services that are not typically considered "internal" to the network. Given the context of needing remote access before deploying a backdoor, using external remote services could be a plausible initial vector.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This involves using valid accounts to gain access to a system or network. While valid accounts can be used for initial access (especially if credentials are compromised), the question implies a need for a technique that facilitates remote access specifically.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This involves using cloud accounts to gain access. While cloud accounts can be a vector for initial access, the question does not specifically mention cloud services as part of the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers need to gain remote access before they can deploy the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - The use of external remote services (T1133) provides a direct method for gaining remote access to a network, which aligns with the need for initial access before deploying a backdoor.
   - While valid accounts (T1078) and local accounts (T1078.003) could be used for access, they don't specifically address the "remote" aspect as directly as external remote services do.
   - Cloud accounts (T1078.004) are not directly implied in the scenario provided.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique for facilitating remote access before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor is using external remote services. 

Final Answer: B
