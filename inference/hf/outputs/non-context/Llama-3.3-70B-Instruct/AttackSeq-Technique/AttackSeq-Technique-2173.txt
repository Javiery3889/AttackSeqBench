To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spear phishing emails. These emails exploit Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance, and the initial access is gained when the victim opens OLE2 format attachments. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before gaining this initial access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with spear phishing, which is a social engineering technique used to deceive victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on links. The fact that Microsoft Word features are exploited for reconnaissance suggests that the attackers are gathering information before or as part of the initial access phase.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host system, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but might not directly precede the initial access gained through opening malicious attachments.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique of spear phishing itself, which is mentioned in the question as the initial vector of attack. It directly precedes the initial access and is the method used to trick the victim into opening the malicious attachment.
   - **C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: Similar to T1592, this involves gathering information about the victim's network. While it could be part of the reconnaissance, it's less directly related to the act of sending phishing emails and gaining initial access through attachment opening.
   - **D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative credentials or authentication materials to gain access, which doesn't directly relate to the initial phase of sending phishing emails and exploiting Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies that the attackers sent spear phishing emails, which directly corresponds to **T1566-Phishing**.
   - The exploitation of Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance is part of the phishing campaign aimed at tricking the victim into opening the attachment, which leads to initial access.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before gaining initial access is the phishing attempt itself, as it is the vector through which the initial access is achieved.

**Final Answer: B**
