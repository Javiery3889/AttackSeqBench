To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes an infection sequence involving two components: `sysOptimizer.bat` and `sysCrt32.exe`. 
   - `sysOptimizer.bat` is involved in collecting personal files, which suggests a data collection phase of the attack.
   - `sysCrt32.exe` initializes execution components, indicating it might be responsible for setting up the environment for further malicious activities.
   - The question asks about the technique used to transfer collected data securely to FTP servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - Data collection (by `sysOptimizer.bat`).
   - Initialization of execution components (by `sysCrt32.exe`).
   - Secure transfer of collected data to FTP servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system. Given that the data has been collected and the question specifies the transfer of this data to FTP servers, this option seems highly relevant. Automated exfiltration could indeed involve transferring data to FTP servers as part of the exfiltration process.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique is about scheduling tasks or jobs to execute at a specific time or interval. While it could be used in the context of an attack for maintaining persistence or executing malicious tasks, it doesn't directly relate to the secure transfer of data to FTP servers.
   - **C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This sub-technique involves obtaining credentials from files. It doesn't directly relate to the transfer of collected data to FTP servers.
   - **D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This sub-technique specifically refers to exfiltrating data to cloud-based text storage sites. While it involves exfiltration, the specific context (text storage sites) doesn't match the scenario described (transfer to FTP servers).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the transfer of collected data to FTP servers, which implies a need for exfiltration techniques.
   - Among the provided options, **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the most directly related to the exfiltration of data, which aligns with the action of transferring collected data to FTP servers.
   - The other options either relate to different phases of an attack (persistence, credential acquisition) or a more specific exfiltration method that doesn't match the FTP server context.

**Final Answer: A**
