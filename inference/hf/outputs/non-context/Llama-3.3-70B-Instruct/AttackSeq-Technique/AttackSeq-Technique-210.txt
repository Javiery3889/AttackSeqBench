To determine the most plausible sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by FamousSparrow for data exfiltration after the described communication with the Command and Control (C&C) server, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question mentions that SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol. This indicates an established communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker's server.
   - It also mentions encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys, which suggests that the attackers are using encryption to protect the data being transmitted.
   - The question asks about the method of data exfiltration used by FamousSparrow after this communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step involves establishing a secure communication channel (using HTTPS and encryption), which is a common precursor to exfiltrating data.
   - The question specifically asks about the exfiltration method, implying we are looking for a TTP related to data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over an already established command and control channel. Given that SparrowDoor has already communicated with the C&C server, using this channel for exfiltration is plausible and efficient.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a process to evade detection or gain access. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery:** This sub-technique involves gathering information about security software installed on the system. It's more related to reconnaissance than to data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This is a duplicate of option A, indicating the same technique of exfiltrating data over an established command and control channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers have established a secure communication channel with the C&C server.
   - They are using encryption for their communications, indicating a desire to protect the data being transmitted.
   - The most direct and efficient method for exfiltrating data, given an established C&C channel, is to use that channel for exfiltration.
   - Options B and C do not directly relate to the act of exfiltrating data.

5. **Final Answer:**
Given the context and the techniques described, the most plausible method for data exfiltration after establishing a secure communication channel with a C&C server is to use that channel for exfiltration. Since options A and D are identical and correctly describe this method, but the format requires selecting one answer, the first occurrence of this correct technique is chosen.

Final Answer: A
