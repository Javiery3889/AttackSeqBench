To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes an initial access vector where a VBA macro is executed using 'mshta.exe' to download a dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL. This indicates the attacker has already gained initial access to the system.
   - The focus is on ensuring "continuous execution of malicious code every two hours," which implies the attacker wants to maintain persistence on the compromised system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial access technique isn't the focus but rather what happens after the initial compromise to maintain persistence.
   - The key detail is the need for the malicious code to run every two hours, suggesting a scheduling mechanism.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1565-Data Manipulation**: This technique involves modifying data to affect the operation of a system or to hide activity. It doesn't directly relate to scheduling or executing code at regular intervals.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is an initial access technique and doesn't pertain to maintaining persistence or scheduling tasks.
   - **C: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**: This sub-technique involves modifying the behavior of Terminal Services by replacing or modifying DLLs. While it could potentially be used for persistence, it doesn't directly relate to scheduling tasks to run at specific intervals.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task to execute at a specific time or interval, which aligns with the requirement for continuous execution of malicious code every two hours.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained access to the system through a VBA macro and 'mshta.exe'.
   - The goal is to ensure the malicious code runs every two hours, indicating a need for a scheduling mechanism.
   - Among the provided options, only one directly relates to scheduling tasks to run at specific intervals.

**Final Answer: D**
