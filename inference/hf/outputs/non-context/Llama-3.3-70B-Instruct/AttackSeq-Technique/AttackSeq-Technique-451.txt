To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Geumseong121, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that Geumseong121 employed Defense Evasion tactics by disguising their fundraising apps to appear unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps. Before this, they needed to distribute the malicious app and gain access to victims' devices through a charity website.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves distributing a malicious app and gaining access to victims' devices through a website. This implies an initial access technique that involves interacting with or compromising a website or the user's device through web-based means.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media like USB drives. It doesn't directly relate to distributing apps through a website.
   - **B: T1037.001-Logon Script (Windows)**: This involves executing scripts during the logon process, typically for persistence or privilege escalation, not for initial access through a website.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's device by exploiting vulnerabilities when they visit a website. It's a common method for initial access and aligns with the scenario of accessing devices through a charity website.
   - **D: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**: This technique is about searching for specific information within websites owned by the victim, which doesn't fit the scenario of distributing malicious apps through a website.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies the use of a charity website as a vector for distributing malicious apps.
   - The technique must allow for initial access to the victim's device through this website.
   - Drive-by Compromise (T1189) fits this scenario as it involves exploiting vulnerabilities in user devices when they visit a compromised or malicious website, which could be used to distribute the malicious app.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique used by Geumseong121 to distribute the malicious app and gain access to victims' devices through the charity website is Drive-by Compromise.

Final Answer: C
