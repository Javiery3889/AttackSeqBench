To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an initial access technique where Tropic Trooper, a known threat actor, exploits Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to execute commands. This is followed by the execution of a backdoor's installer, which is triggered by users' actions or interactions.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial access is gained through exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. The next step involves the execution of a backdoor installer that relies on user interaction.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with command and control (C2) servers. While encryption might be used in the communication between the backdoor and its C2, this does not directly relate to the execution of the backdoor installer based on user interaction.
   - **B: T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This sub-technique involves creating a fork of a process to hide malicious activity. Although process manipulation is a common tactic, the question specifically mentions the execution of the backdoor installer triggered by user action, not the forking of resources or processes.
   - **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique refers to executing code in existing applications or services to blend in with normal activity, but it doesn't directly imply the need for user interaction to trigger the execution.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code by convincing a user to perform a certain action, such as opening a malicious document or clicking on a link. This directly aligns with the scenario described, where the backdoor's installer is executed as a result of user interaction.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial exploitation of the Equation Editor vulnerability allows the attackers to gain access.
   - The subsequent step involves executing a backdoor installer, which requires user interaction to be triggered.
   - Among the provided options, **T1204-User Execution** is the technique that most closely matches the scenario of leveraging user action or interaction to trigger the deployment of the backdoor's installer.

**Final Answer: D**
