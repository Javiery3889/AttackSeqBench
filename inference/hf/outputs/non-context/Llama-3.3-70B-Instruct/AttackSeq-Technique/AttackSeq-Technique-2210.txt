To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions leveraging credential access to retrieve data via tools like Mimikatz and procdump. These tools are commonly used for extracting credentials from a system, such as passwords, hashes, or even dumping the memory of a process (like LSASS) to obtain sensitive information. After obtaining such access, the attacker's goal is to gather email data from the victim's systems.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial step involves credential access, which aligns with techniques under the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The use of Mimikatz and procdump suggests the attacker has gained access to the system and is looking to exploit this access for further data collection, specifically email data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download or upload files. While it could be used in various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to gathering email data.
   - **B: T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This involves stealing web cookies, which could potentially be used to access web-based email accounts without needing the password, but it's more about session hijacking than directly collecting email data.
   - **C: T1114-Email Collection**: This technique directly involves collecting email data, which could be through various means such as accessing email client applications, webmail, or email servers. Given the context of the question, this seems highly relevant.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which could potentially reveal sensitive information but is less directly related to the systematic collection of email data compared to other options.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained credential access, indicating they are past the initial stages of the attack.
   - The goal is to collect email data, suggesting the attacker is looking for specific, potentially sensitive information.
   - Among the provided options, **T1114-Email Collection** is the most directly related to the goal of gathering email data.

**Final Answer: C**
