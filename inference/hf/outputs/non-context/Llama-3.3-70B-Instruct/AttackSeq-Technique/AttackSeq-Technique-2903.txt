To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the 'yty' framework collected keystrokes, screenshots, and file information using its plugins, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The 'yty' framework is collecting sensitive data (keystrokes, screenshots, and file information) from a compromised system. This action suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now in the phase of gathering valuable data.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The collection of keystrokes, screenshots, and file information indicates that the attacker is in the "Collection" phase of the attack lifecycle, which is part of the broader "Credential Access" and "Collection" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1583.005-Botnet**: This technique involves using a botnet to conduct attacks. While botnets can be used for various malicious activities, the collection of keystrokes, screenshots, and file information doesn't directly imply the use of a botnet for these specific actions.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Given that the 'yty' framework has collected sensitive data, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data back to the attacker, making this a plausible next step.
   - **C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using symmetric encryption over a non-C2 protocol. While this is also a method of exfiltration, it's more specific to the use of symmetric encryption and non-C2 protocols, which may not be the immediate next step without more context on the encryption methods used by the 'yty' framework.
   - **D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories. The scenario describes the collection of specific types of data (keystrokes, screenshots, file information) rather than accessing general data repositories, making this less directly related to the next step after data collection.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the 'yty' framework has collected sensitive data, the most logical next step in the attack sequence would be to exfiltrate this data. The most straightforward and directly related technique to this action is exfiltrating the data over a C2 channel, as it directly follows the collection of data and is a common method used by attackers to retrieve stolen data.

Final Answer: B
