To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after FIN13 utilized lateral movement methods, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement refers to the techniques used by attackers to move through a network after gaining initial access. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or leveraging tools like Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and custom web shells (like BUSTEDPIPE mentioned) to access additional systems.

2. **Purpose of Lateral Movement**: The primary goal of lateral movement is to expand the attacker's control within the network, often to reach sensitive areas or data. This could be for various purposes, including data exfiltration, establishing persistence, or disrupting operations.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: T1056.001 - Keylogging**: Keylogging involves capturing keystrokes to obtain sensitive information like passwords or encryption keys. While it's a possible action after gaining access, it's more about establishing persistence or obtaining further credentials rather than directly following lateral movement aimed at data access.
   - **B: T1123 - Audio Capture**: Audio capture involves recording audio from a compromised system, typically for espionage purposes. This is less directly related to the immediate goals of lateral movement, which often focus on data or system control.
   - **C: T1567 - Exfiltration Over Web Service**: Exfiltration involves transferring data from the compromised network to the attacker's systems. Given that lateral movement is often aimed at accessing sensitive data, exfiltration is a logical next step after successfully moving laterally within a network.
   - **D: T1039 - Data from Network Shared Drive**: Accessing data from a network shared drive is a method of collecting sensitive information. While this could be a goal of lateral movement, the specific mention of utilizing web services for exfiltration (as in option C) aligns more closely with the use of custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.

4. **Conclusion**: Considering the context provided, the most plausible next step after utilizing lateral movement methods (especially with the mention of custom web shells) would be to exfiltrate data over a web service. This directly leverages the access gained through lateral movement and aligns with the capabilities suggested by the use of custom web shells.

Final Answer: C
