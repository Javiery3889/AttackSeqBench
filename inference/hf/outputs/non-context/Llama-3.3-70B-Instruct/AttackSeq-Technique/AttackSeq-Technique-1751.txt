To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the described actions, let's break down the scenario and analyze the techniques mentioned in the answer choices.

1. **Initial Action**: TG1021 used compromised domain credentials to access shared folders and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB. This action involves lateral movement and the use of credentials to access network resources, which is a common step after initial access to expand control within a network.

2. **Technique Used Initially**: The use of compromised credentials and SMB for lateral movement and dropping a web shell loader aligns with techniques like T1021 (Remote Services) for the initial access and lateral movement, and potentially T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services) if the web shell is exploiting a vulnerability in a remote service.

3. **Next Likely Step**: After gaining access and dropping a web shell, the next steps often involve escalating privileges to gain more control over the system or network, maintaining access, or moving laterally to other systems.

Let's evaluate the answer choices based on this context:

A. **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves exploiting weaknesses in elevation control mechanisms to gain higher levels of access. Given that the attackers have already gained access and are looking to compromise additional servers, escalating privileges to move more freely within the network is a logical next step.

B. **T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**: This technique involves using Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) for lateral movement. While it's a method for moving laterally, the initial action already described the use of SMB for lateral movement and dropping a web shell, making this less likely as the immediate next step unless it's part of a broader lateral movement strategy.

C. **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**: This technique is about using publish/subscribe protocols for command and control (C2). While establishing C2 is crucial, the immediate next step after dropping a web shell and looking to compromise additional servers might not necessarily involve setting up a new C2 channel unless the existing method is insufficient.

D. **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services. Given that the attackers have dropped a web shell, which could be exploiting a vulnerability, this could be a plausible next step if they're looking to exploit services on additional servers. However, the question implies they're past the initial exploitation phase and are now looking to expand their access.

Considering the logical progression of an attack, after gaining initial access and dropping a web shell, the attackers would likely seek to **escalate their privileges** to move more freely and access more sensitive areas of the network. This makes **A: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism** the most plausible next step as it directly supports the goal of compromising additional servers by potentially granting higher levels of access.

Final Answer: A
