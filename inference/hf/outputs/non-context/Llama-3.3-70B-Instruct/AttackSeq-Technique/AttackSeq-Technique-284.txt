To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the initial access and before downloading additional malware, let's break down the scenario and analyze the given answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear-phishing emails containing exploit documents. This method is used to gain initial access to the victim's system. The technique used here is not explicitly mentioned in the choices but is a precursor to the actions described.

2. **Action on Objective**: After gaining initial access, the attacker needs to establish a foothold, maintain access, or move laterally within the network. The question mentions employing encoded blobs to bypass detection for downloading additional malware, which implies the attacker is trying to evade defenses and possibly set up a command and control (C2) channel or execute further malicious actions.

Given answer choices and their relevance:
- **A: T1059.011-Lua**: This refers to the use of Lua, a scripting language, as a command and scripting interpreter. While it could be used in various stages of an attack, it's less directly related to the immediate actions following initial access and preceding the use of encoded blobs for malware download.
  
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. It's a broad category that could be relevant after initial access, as attackers often use built-in scripting interpreters (like PowerShell, cmd, or bash) to execute further malicious scripts or commands, potentially including those that decode and execute blobs.

- **C: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves using a local account to move laterally or maintain access within a network. While important for post-exploitation activities, it's not directly related to the action of downloading additional malware using encoded blobs.

- **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which could be a step in maintaining access or escalating privileges but doesn't directly relate to the action of using encoded blobs to download malware.

Considering the sequence of actions:
1. Initial access via spear-phishing.
2. A need to execute commands or scripts to possibly decode and execute blobs for downloading additional malware.

The most plausible sequence suggests that after gaining initial access, the attacker would likely use a **command and scripting interpreter** to execute further scripts or commands, which could include decoding and executing the blobs for downloading additional malware. This action is a precursor to more advanced post-exploitation activities like credential theft or lateral movement.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access method: Spear-phishing with exploit documents.
2. Determine the next logical step: Executing commands or scripts to further the attack.
3. Evaluate the choices based on relevance to executing scripts or commands.
4. Choose the most appropriate technique based on the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B**
