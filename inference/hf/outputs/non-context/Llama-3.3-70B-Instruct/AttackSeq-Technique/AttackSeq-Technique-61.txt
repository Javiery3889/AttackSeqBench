To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the successful execution of Office Macro Scripts to load the Chinotto malware. This implies that the initial stage of the attack involves exploiting Office applications' macro capabilities to execute malicious code. The goal is to evade detection and load the malware without alerting defenses.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with the execution of Office Macro Scripts, which is a method used to execute code on a victim's system. This technique is often used to bypass traditional security controls that might block executable files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves using spearphishing with an attachment to gain initial access. While it could be a precursor to the execution of Office Macro Scripts, it doesn't directly relate to evading detection after the malware is loaded.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. Office Macro Scripts fall under this category, but the question asks for the technique that occurred after the successful execution of these scripts to evade detection.
   - **C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: Reflective code loading is a technique where code is loaded into memory without being written to disk. This can be used to evade detection since traditional signature-based detection methods might not catch the malware if it doesn't touch the disk.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: Hijacking execution flow involves intercepting and altering or redirecting the flow of API calls, which can be used to evade detection or hide malicious activity. However, this is more about altering the behavior of existing processes rather than loading new code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies that Office Macro Scripts were used to load the Chinotto malware, indicating the malware is already on the system.
   - The goal is to evade detection and load the malware without alerting defenses, suggesting the need for a technique that minimizes the footprint of the malware.
   - Reflective code loading (T1620) directly addresses the need to load malware into memory without touching the disk, which aligns with evading detection by traditional means.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the need to evade detection after the initial loading of the malware via Office Macro Scripts, the most plausible technique is reflective code loading, as it allows the malware to reside in memory without being written to disk, thus reducing the likelihood of detection.

Final Answer: C
