To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has established persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe to maintain a Poison Ivy server process.
   - The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique most likely used to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**: This technique involves generating requests to manipulate multi-factor authentication mechanisms. It doesn't directly relate to securing communication over a network.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to redirect traffic, which might be used for communication but doesn't inherently imply securing the communication channel itself.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique is about executing system commands or programs in response to specific events. It doesn't directly relate to securing network communications.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to secure communication channels. Given the context of securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP, this seems the most relevant.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the goal of the attacker, which is to secure communication.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that securing communication typically involves protecting the data in transit.
   - **Step 3**: Among the provided options, identify the technique that directly addresses securing or protecting data in transit.
   - **Step 4**: Eliminate options that do not directly relate to securing communication channels (A, B, C).
   - **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP, especially in the context of maintaining a command and control (C2) channel like Poison Ivy, is to create an encrypted channel.

Final Answer: D
