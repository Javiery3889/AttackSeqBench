To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the BlackEnergy dropper executed "vba_macro.exe" using a macro-enabled Word document, let's break down the information provided and analyze the options:

1. **Initial Action**: The BlackEnergy dropper executes "vba_macro.exe" via a macro-enabled Word document. This action involves running malicious code directly in memory, which is a common technique used by attackers to evade detection and establish a foothold in a system.

2. **Understanding the Techniques**:
   - **T1547: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically when a system boots up or a user logs on. It's a method used for persistence.
   - **T1092: Communication Through Removable Media**: This involves using removable media (like USB drives) to transfer data between systems, often to bypass network controls.
   - **T1546.012: Image File Execution Options Injection**: This is a specific case of modifying the Image File Execution Options registry key to load a malicious DLL instead of or in addition to a legitimate one, facilitating code execution.
   - **T1095: Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-standard network protocols (not typically used by applications) for communication, potentially to evade detection.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The execution of "vba_macro.exe" from a macro-enabled Word document indicates an initial stage of compromise where the attacker is trying to establish a presence on the system. 
   - **T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution)** could be a plausible next step for achieving persistence, ensuring the malware remains active even after a system restart or user logoff.
   - **T1092 (Communication Through Removable Media)** seems less directly related to the immediate next steps following the execution of a dropper from a document.
   - **T1546.012 (Image File Execution Options Injection)** is a technique that could be used for persistence or privilege escalation but is more specific to modifying how executables are loaded.
   - **T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol)** might be used for command and control (C2) communication but doesn't directly follow from the execution of a dropper in terms of establishing persistence or further compromise.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of executing a dropper and the need for the malware to establish persistence to continue its operations, **T1547: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** appears to be the most logical next step. This technique would allow the malware to survive system reboots and maintain its presence on the compromised system.
