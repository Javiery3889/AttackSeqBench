To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses defense evasion methods (redirecting victims to legitimate services and using domain shortening services) to ultimately access credentials through phishing pages that impersonate login portals. The key elements here are the use of phishing to impersonate login portals and the goal of accessing credentials.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves defense evasion techniques leading to phishing aimed at capturing credentials. The ATT&CK techniques mentioned in the options need to be evaluated in the context of this sequence, particularly focusing on how credentials are accessed or captured.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1003.004-LSA Secrets**: This technique involves accessing Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which could include credentials. However, this technique is more about post-compromise credential access from the system itself rather than through phishing.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique is about using a proxy to hide the true source of traffic. While it could be used in conjunction with phishing for evasion, it doesn't directly relate to accessing credentials through phishing pages.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique is about developing capabilities, such as tools or infrastructure, to support an operation. It's too broad and doesn't directly relate to the specific action of accessing credentials through phishing.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which could include credentials entered into phishing pages impersonating login portals. It directly aligns with the goal of accessing credentials through phishing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions accessing credentials through phishing pages.
   - Phishing is a method to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as credentials.
   - Among the given options, **T1056-Input Capture** is the most relevant technique when considering the capture of credentials through user input, such as when a user enters their login credentials into a phishing page.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs given the context of the question points towards input capture as the method used to access credentials.

Final Answer: D
