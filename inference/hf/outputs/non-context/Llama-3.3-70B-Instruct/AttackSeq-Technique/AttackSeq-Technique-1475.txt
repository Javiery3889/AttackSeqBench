To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions a sequence of actions involving the SLUB backdoor, which includes retrieving commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet and obtaining the username and computer name. This indicates an initial stage of compromise where the attacker is gathering information about the system.
   - The techniques mentioned in the answer choices are from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary tactics and techniques.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1485-Data Destruction** (A) involves deleting or destroying data, which doesn't directly follow the action of gathering system information.
   - **T1102-Web Service** (B and D, duplicate option) could be related to the use of web services for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration, but it doesn't directly relate to the discovery process described.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** (C) involves techniques used to identify the owner or users of a system, which aligns with obtaining the username and computer name as part of the discovery process.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The SLUB backdoor's action of retrieving commands and obtaining system information (username and computer name) suggests it is in the process of gathering intelligence about the compromised system.
   - Given that **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** directly involves identifying system owners or users, this technique aligns with the actions described in the question.
   - The other options (A, B, D) do not directly follow the described sequence of gathering system information as closely as **T1033** does.
   
Final Answer: C
