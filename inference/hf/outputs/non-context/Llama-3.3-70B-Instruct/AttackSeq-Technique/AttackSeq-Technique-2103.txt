To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-sandboxing techniques. This implies we are looking for an action or technique that would logically precede the use of evasion methods, specifically those designed to evade analysis and sandbox detection.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The question mentions the employment of anti-analysis and anti-sandboxing techniques. In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, techniques like `T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion` directly relate to anti-sandboxing. However, we need to identify a technique that would plausibly occur before such evasion techniques are employed, particularly in the context of an infection chain aiming to evade defense mechanisms.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing**: This technique involves manipulating the command line arguments of a process to disguise its true purpose. While it could be used for evasion, it doesn't necessarily precede anti-sandboxing techniques in a logical sequence of infection.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim. It's more related to data collection rather than evasion or initial infection chain activities.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This is directly related to evading sandbox detection, which is mentioned in the question as part of the evasion techniques used. However, the question asks for a technique that occurred before such evasion.
   - **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: Using non-standard ports could be a method to evade detection by traditional security mechanisms but doesn't directly relate to the sequence of employing anti-analysis and anti-sandboxing techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question hints at an action that precedes evasion techniques, specifically those aimed at analysis and sandbox evasion.
   - Techniques like `T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion` are directly related to evasion but are part of the evasion process itself, not preceding it.
   - `T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing` could be part of an evasion strategy but doesn't necessarily fit as a precursor to employing anti-sandboxing techniques in a way that's more direct than other options.
   - `T1113-Screen Capture` is more about post-infection data collection rather than evasion or initial infection tactics.
   - `T1571-Non-Standard Port` could be used early in an infection chain to communicate with command and control servers without being detected by traditional firewall rules, potentially before more specific evasion techniques like sandbox evasion are employed.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of the question, which asks for a technique that likely occurred before anti-analysis and anti-sandboxing techniques were employed, the most plausible answer is related to the initial stages of an infection chain where attackers might try to establish communication or presence without immediate detection. Using non-standard ports for communication could be an early tactic to avoid detection, making it a plausible precursor to more specific evasion techniques.

Final Answer: D
