To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary, Infamous Chisel, is in the process of collecting files of interest from a local system. Before exfiltrating these files, the adversary needs to enumerate data directories and gather system information. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely enables this enumeration and gathering of information.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves collecting files, enumerating data directories, gathering system information, and then exfiltrating the collected files. The specific technique we are looking for fits into the middle part of this sequence, between collecting files and exfiltrating them.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique involves stealing web cookies, which doesn't directly relate to enumerating data directories or gathering system information on a local system.
   - **B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique is about using non-standard protocols for communication, which doesn't directly apply to the task of enumerating directories or gathering system information.
   - **C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This involves using cloud accounts for various malicious purposes, which is not directly relevant to the local system enumeration described.
   - **D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique is specifically about discovering local file and directory structures, which aligns perfectly with the need to enumerate data directories and gather system information before exfiltrating files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The adversary needs to identify where the files of interest are located on the system.
   - Enumerating data directories is crucial for finding these files.
   - Gathering system information can help in understanding the system's layout and potential security measures.
   - Among the given options, only one directly addresses the need to discover and explore the file system and directory structure.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the technique that most likely enables Infamous Chisel to enumerate data directories and gather system information is directly related to discovering file and directory structures on the local system.

Final Answer: D
