To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the XAgent app is hiding its icon and running in the background on an iOS 7 device. The focus is on the technique most likely used to collect geo-location data from the device after this initial action.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial action involves hiding the app's icon and running in the background, which suggests evasion techniques. However, the question specifically asks about collecting geo-location data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding** is related to encoding data to avoid detection, which doesn't directly relate to collecting geo-location data.
   - **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules** is about bypassing authentication mechanisms, not directly related to geo-location data collection.
   - **C: T1614-System Location Discovery** involves gathering information about the system's location, which aligns with collecting geo-location data.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** is about identifying the system's owner or user, not directly related to geo-location.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The XAgent app's action of hiding and running in the background suggests it's trying to operate stealthily.
   - Collecting geo-location data is a specific action that would fall under discovering system location information.
   - Among the given options, **T1614-System Location Discovery** is the technique that directly involves collecting information about the device's location.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the focus on collecting geo-location data from the device, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique is related to system location discovery.

Final Answer: C
