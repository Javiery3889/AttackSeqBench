To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the delivery and opening of malicious Excel Web Query files (.iqy) as part of a spear-phishing campaign by DarkHydrus. This is followed by the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands for script execution by RogueRobin. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before the use of these obfuscated PowerShell commands.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with spear-phishing, which involves delivering malicious files (.iqy) to the victim. Once these files are opened, they presumably lead to the execution of malicious code. The question then mentions the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands for script execution.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique involves using a container orchestration tool to execute malicious code. While it's a method for executing scripts, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of receiving malicious files and then executing obfuscated PowerShell commands.
   - **B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This involves using a protocol to tunnel network traffic to avoid detection. It doesn't directly fit the sequence of executing scripts after opening malicious files.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter (like PowerShell) to execute scripts. Given that the question mentions the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, this technique seems closely related but is actually what is being used, not what happened before.
   - **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves making data unreadable to hide its contents. Given that the PowerShell commands are described as "obfuscated," it suggests that data obfuscation occurred to hide the intent of the PowerShell scripts before they were executed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack starts with a spear-phishing campaign delivering .iqy files.
   - The malicious files lead to the execution of code, which in this context, involves using PowerShell.
   - Before the PowerShell commands can be executed in a way that avoids detection, they need to be obfuscated.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the execution of these obfuscated PowerShell commands is the obfuscation of the data (the PowerShell commands) themselves.

**Final Answer: D**
