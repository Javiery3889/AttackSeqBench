To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the VBA code within the external template decrypted data from the malicious Microsoft Word document and dropped it into files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg', let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Situation**: The scenario describes a malicious Microsoft Word document that uses VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code to decrypt data. This data is then dropped into files named 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'. The file 'fmx.ps1' suggests a PowerShell script, which is a scripting language used for task automation and configuration management on Windows systems. The presence of a PowerShell script file indicates that the next step in the attack sequence likely involves the execution of this script.

2. **Understanding ATT&CK Techniques**:
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the use of a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. PowerShell is a common interpreter used for this purpose.
   - **T1053.002-At**: This sub-technique involves using the Windows Task Scheduler's 'at' utility to schedule tasks. While it's a method for executing commands, it's more about scheduling rather than direct execution of scripts like PowerShell.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for communication. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of scripts or commands on a compromised system.
   - **T1562.012-Disable or Modify Linux Audit System**: This technique is specific to modifying audit systems on Linux platforms, which doesn't directly relate to the execution of PowerShell scripts on Windows.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - Given that 'fmx.ps1' is a PowerShell script, the most logical next step after dropping this file would be its execution. The technique that directly involves executing scripts or commands through an interpreter like PowerShell is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.
   - The other options do not directly relate to the execution of PowerShell scripts. **T1053.002-At** is about scheduling tasks, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is about communication protocols, and **T1562.012-Disable or Modify Linux Audit System** is specific to Linux and audit system modification, which doesn't fit the context of executing a PowerShell script on a Windows system.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the VBA code decrypts and drops the files is the execution of the PowerShell script 'fmx.ps1'. Therefore, the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred is related to using a command and scripting interpreter.
