To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where Infamous Chisel automatically collects files from the local system and application directories.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to exfiltrate these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - The key elements here are the automatic collection of files and the use of specific methods (Tor hidden service and SSH connections) for exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1020 - Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system. Given that the question mentions the automatic collection of files and the use of specific channels (Tor hidden service and SSH connections) for exfiltration, this seems highly relevant.
   - **T1614 - System Location Discovery**: This technique is about discovering the system's geographic location. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of files.
   - **T1499.001 - OS Exhaustion Flood**: This sub-technique involves overwhelming a system with traffic in order to degrade its performance, which is unrelated to the exfiltration of collected files.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - Step 1: Identify the key action in the question, which is the exfiltration of collected files.
   - Step 2: Recognize that the exfiltration is done automatically and involves specific methods (Tor hidden service and SSH connections).
   - Step 3: Match the key action with the provided ATT&CK techniques.
   - Step 4: Eliminate techniques that do not directly relate to exfiltration (T1614 and T1499.001).
   - Step 5: Select the technique that best matches the description of automatic exfiltration, which is T1020 - Automated Exfiltration.
   
Given that both A and B are labeled as T1020-Automated Exfiltration, and this is the technique that best fits the description provided in the question, the correct answer would logically be either A or B. However, since both options A and B are identical and correctly represent the technique for automated exfiltration, and there's no distinction provided between them in the context of the question, we must choose one based on the information given.

Final Answer: A
