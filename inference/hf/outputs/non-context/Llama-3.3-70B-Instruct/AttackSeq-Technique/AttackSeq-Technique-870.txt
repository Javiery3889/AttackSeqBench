To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after GreyEnergy stealthily deployed selected modules and before using internal C&C proxies for Lateral Movement, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - GreyEnergy deployed selected modules to specific targets as needed.
   - These modules were partially encrypted using AES-256 for Defense Evasion.
   - The next step in the sequence involves using internal C&C (Command and Control) proxies for Lateral Movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action involves deploying and encrypting modules (Defense Evasion).
   - The subsequent action is related to Lateral Movement using internal C&C proxies.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but doesn't directly relate to the actions described (deployment of encrypted modules and lateral movement).
   - **B: T1564.002-Hidden Users**: This technique is about creating hidden users, which could be a part of establishing persistence but doesn't directly follow the deployment of encrypted modules for evasion and the use of C&C proxies for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making files or information difficult to understand or detect, which aligns with the use of AES-256 encryption for Defense Evasion. Given that the modules were partially encrypted, this technique directly relates to the actions described before the lateral movement phase.
   - **D: T1584.008-Network Devices**: This involves compromising network devices, which could be part of lateral movement but doesn't directly follow the sequence of encrypting modules for evasion and then moving laterally.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker (GreyEnergy) is taking steps to evade detection by encrypting modules and then plans to move laterally within the network.
   - The encryption of modules (using AES-256) is a clear indicator of attempting to obfuscate files or information (T1027), which is a technique used for Defense Evasion.
   - This action of encrypting modules would logically precede the attempt to move laterally within the network, as it sets the stage for covert operations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence involves the use of obfuscated files or information (T1027) after the deployment and encryption of modules and before the lateral movement phase.

**Final Answer: C**
