To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that attackers have already gathered detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) queries. This action is part of the discovery phase, where attackers are trying to learn as much as they can about the victim's system. The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next as part of their surveillance objectives related to data acquisition.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with the attackers gathering system details, which is a discovery tactic. The next step should logically align with the goal of acquiring more data from the system, given that the attackers are in the surveillance phase and aiming for data acquisition.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1070.003-Clear Command History**: This technique involves clearing command history to evade detection. While it's a plausible action for attackers to take, it doesn't directly relate to acquiring data from the system.
   - **B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This involves making encoded or obfuscated data readable. It could be relevant if the attackers found encoded data, but the question doesn't specify that they encountered encoded files.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: Archiving collected data is more about exfiltration and securing the data for later use rather than the act of acquiring it from the system.
   - **D: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the goal of data acquisition mentioned in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already used WMI queries for discovery.
   - The next logical step in their surveillance objectives related to data acquisition would be to collect more data directly from the system.
   - T1005 (Data from Local System) directly relates to collecting data from the system, fitting the context of surveillance and data acquisition objectives.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of the question and the techniques provided, the most plausible next step in the sequence of TTPs for the attackers' surveillance objectives related to data acquisition from the victim's system is collecting data directly from the system.

Final Answer: D
