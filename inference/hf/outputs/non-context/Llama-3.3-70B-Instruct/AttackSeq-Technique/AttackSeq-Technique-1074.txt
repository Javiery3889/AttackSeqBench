To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with the use of a PowerShell loader to deploy malware. This indicates an initial access and execution phase.
   - The malware is deployed via an Internet Explorer exploit, which suggests exploitation of a client application vulnerability.
   - The campaign then targets system-level privileges with an LPE (Local Privilege Escalation) binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458. This indicates a privilege escalation phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - Initial Access: Using an Internet Explorer exploit to deploy malware.
   - Execution: Deploying malware via a PowerShell loader.
   - Privilege Escalation: Using an LPE binary to exploit CVE-2019-1458 for system-level privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1055.014-VDSO Hijacking**: This is a Linux-specific technique related to exploiting the VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) to hijack system calls. It doesn't directly relate to the initial phases of exploiting Internet Explorer or using PowerShell for malware deployment.
   - **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves exploiting weaknesses in elevation control mechanisms to gain higher privileges. While it's relevant to privilege escalation, the question specifically mentions exploiting CVE-2019-1458, which is more directly related to exploiting a vulnerability for client execution and then escalating privileges.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications (like Internet Explorer) to execute malicious code. Given the context of using an Internet Explorer exploit to deploy malware, this technique aligns well with the initial phase of the attack.
   - **D: T1069.002-Domain Groups**: This involves using domain groups to escalate privileges or move laterally within a network. While relevant to post-exploitation activities, it doesn't directly precede the exploitation of a system vulnerability like CVE-2019-1458 for privilege escalation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack starts with exploiting an Internet Explorer vulnerability, which aligns with exploiting a client application for execution.
   - The use of a PowerShell loader for deploying malware further supports the execution phase.
   - Before targeting system-level privileges, the attackers would need to have code execution on the system, which is achieved through client execution exploitation.

5. **Final Answer**:
Given the sequence of events described, the most likely technique to have occurred before the campaign targeted system-level privileges with an LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458 is the exploitation of a client application (Internet Explorer) for the initial execution of malicious code.

Final Answer: C
