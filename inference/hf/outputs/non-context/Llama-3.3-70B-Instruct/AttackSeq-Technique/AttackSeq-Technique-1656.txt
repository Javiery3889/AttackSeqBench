To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after victims were redirected to compromised websites where scripts or HTML smuggling techniques were employed for malware delivery, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where victims are redirected to compromised websites. These websites use scripts or HTML smuggling techniques to deliver malware. This implies an initial stage of an attack where the attacker is attempting to gain access to the victim's system or device.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The described sequence involves:
   - Redirecting victims to compromised websites.
   - Using scripts or HTML smuggling for malware delivery.

Given this context, we are looking for an ATT&CK technique that would logically follow the successful delivery of malware, which typically aims to establish a foothold in the victim's environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which could be a later stage of an attack after the attacker has established access and is looking to extract sensitive information.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or to deliver malware. While phishing could be an initial vector, the question describes a scenario post-malware delivery.
   - **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's owners or users, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but doesn't directly follow malware delivery in terms of immediate post-exploitation actions.
   - **D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: Spearphishing via a link is a specific type of phishing that involves sending targeted emails with malicious links. This technique is more about the initial compromise rather than post-malware delivery activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario described involves the delivery of malware through compromised websites and scripts/HTML smuggling.
   - The immediate next steps after successful malware delivery would typically involve establishing a foothold, escalating privileges, or beginning to move laterally within the network, rather than the techniques described in the answer choices directly.
   - However, considering the options provided, **T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites** seems less directly related to the immediate post-compromise activities like establishing a foothold or reconnaissance but is more aligned with actions an attacker might take after gaining access and looking to extract data.
   - **T1566-Phishing** and **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link** are more about initial access vectors rather than post-exploitation techniques.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** could be part of the attacker's reconnaissance but doesn't directly follow the described action of malware delivery through compromised websites as closely as exfiltration might in terms of being a distinct, later-stage activity.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the need to select the most plausible next step after malware delivery via compromised websites, none of the options perfectly fit the immediate next steps like establishing a foothold or escalating privileges. However, considering the provided options and the logic of post-exploitation activities, **A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites** might be considered a later-stage activity that could follow initial compromise, even though it's not the most direct next step.

**Final Answer: A**
