To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where a malware, CEIDPageLock, uses a dropped driver to evade detection and then connects to a Command and Control (C&C) server to download a configuration.
   - The key elements here are the evasion of endpoint security products and the communication with a C&C server for downloading configurations.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The first part involves evasion techniques, but the question focuses on the communication aspect, specifically downloading configurations from a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1216.002-SyncAppvPublishingServer**: This technique involves using a publishing server for application virtualization, which doesn't directly relate to the described scenario of connecting to a C&C server for downloading configurations.
   - **B: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature**: This involves using an invalid code signature to evade detection, which is not directly related to the communication with a C&C server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 (Command and Control) communication. Given that CEIDPageLock connects to a C&C server to download configurations, this technique aligns closely with the scenario described.
   - **D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This involves collecting data from information repositories, which doesn't directly match the scenario of downloading configurations from a C&C server for the purpose of malware operation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes CEIDPageLock communicating with a C&C server to download configurations after evading detection.
   - The focus is on the communication aspect for C2 purposes.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the technique that best matches this description because it involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, etc.) for communication between the malware and its C&C server, which fits the context of downloading configurations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs given the context is related to using application layer protocols for C2 communication.

Final Answer: C
