To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT28, a known advanced persistent threat group, has already gained initial access to a network through spear-phishing and OLDBAIT (a technique related to exploiting outdated or vulnerable software). The question asks which ATT&CK technique would most likely allow APT28 to move deeper into the victim networks after they have exploited internet-facing servers.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) here involves:
   - Initial Access: Gained through spear-phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities (OLDBAIT).
   - The next step involves moving deeper into the network after exploiting internet-facing servers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting services that are available remotely, which could include internet-facing servers. After gaining initial access, exploiting remote services could be a logical next step to move deeper into the network, especially if the initial access was through a vulnerable service.
   - **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: While cloud services could be a target for lateral movement, the question specifically mentions exploitation of internet-facing servers, not necessarily cloud services.
   - **C: T1653-Power Settings**: Modifying power settings is more related to disrupting or preparing for persistence and evasion rather than moving deeper into a network.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: Hiding artifacts is related to evasion techniques, which, while important for maintaining access, does not directly contribute to moving deeper into the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already gained initial access.
   - They need to move deeper into the network.
   - Exploiting internet-facing servers suggests they are looking for vulnerabilities in services that are exposed to the internet.
   - The most direct technique for moving deeper, given this context, involves exploiting these services further.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of exploiting internet-facing servers to move deeper into the network, the most plausible technique is the exploitation of remote services, as it directly aligns with the scenario of leveraging vulnerabilities in services exposed to the internet for further network access.

Final Answer: A
