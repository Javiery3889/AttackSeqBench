To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before T9000 (exfiltration of collected sensitive data to a C2 server), let's analyze the given options in the context of a typical attack sequence.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the exfiltration of sensitive data, which is a late-stage activity in the attack lifecycle. The technique T9000 involves compressing, encrypting, and sending collected data to a Command and Control (C2) server. We need to identify a technique that logically precedes this action.

2. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud-based storage sites. While it is an exfiltration technique, it doesn't directly relate to the preparation or actions immediately preceding the exfiltration to a C2 server as described.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is about exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which is similar to what T9000 describes. However, the question asks for a technique that occurs before exfiltration, not the exfiltration itself.
   - **C: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools**: This involves modifying security tools to avoid detection. While this could be a part of the attack sequence to ensure the exfiltration goes undetected, it's not directly related to the preparation for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is a precursor to exfiltrating data securely. Before an attacker can compress, encrypt, and send data to a C2 server, they would likely establish a secure (encrypted) communication channel to protect the data in transit.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for a technique that precedes the exfiltration of data to a C2 server.
   - Exfiltration (T9000) involves sending data securely, implying the need for a secure channel.
   - Establishing an encrypted channel (T1573) is a logical precursor to secure exfiltration, as it ensures the data cannot be intercepted and read during transmission.

**Final Answer: D**
