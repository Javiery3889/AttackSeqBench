To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after APT15 evaded policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe to facilitate the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: APT15, a known advanced persistent threat group, has evaded security policy settings that were meant to disable the command prompt. They achieved this by copying and patching cmd.exe, which is a critical system file in Windows that provides the command-line interface. This action suggests that the attackers were looking to maintain access and execute commands on the compromised system, possibly to install additional malware like the RoyalDNS backdoor.

2. **Analyzing the Techniques**:
   - **T1574.013 - KernelCallbackTable**: This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table to hide malicious activity. While it's a method used for evasion, it doesn't directly relate to the installation of backdoors or the evasion of policy settings to execute commands.
   - **T1562 - Impair Defenses**: This technique involves impairing system defenses, which aligns with the action of evading policy settings to use the command prompt. By patching cmd.exe, APT15 impaired the defense mechanism that was supposed to prevent command prompt usage, facilitating further malicious activities like installing backdoors.
   - **T1556.005 - Reversible Encryption**: This technique is about using reversible encryption to conceal data. While encryption might be used in the communication of the backdoor, the primary action described (evading policy settings and patching cmd.exe) doesn't directly relate to reversible encryption.
   - **T1649 - Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**: This involves obtaining or creating fake authentication certificates, which could be used for persistence or evasion but doesn't directly follow from the action of patching cmd.exe to install a backdoor.

3. **Conclusion**: Given the context of evading policy settings to use the command prompt and then installing a backdoor, the most relevant technique is impairing defenses. This is because the primary goal of patching cmd.exe was to bypass a security control (defense) that prevented the use of the command prompt, thereby impairing the system's defenses and allowing for the installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

Final Answer: B
