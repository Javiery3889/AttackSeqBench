To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions the Aria-body backdoor gathering extensive system information during the Discovery phase.
   - It asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to support the group's objective during the Collection phase.
   - The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the system and its environment, which is a precursor to the Collection phase, where the adversary collects data of interest.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim's system, which could be part of the Collection phase if the adversary is interested in visual data or interactions.
   - **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which could be used to collect sensitive information like passwords or other data entered by the user.
   - **T1564.002-Hidden Users**: This sub-technique is about creating hidden users on a system, which is more related to Persistence or Privilege Escalation rather than directly supporting data collection.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique is about discovering the processes running on a system, which is more aligned with the Discovery phase rather than the Collection phase.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for a technique that supports the group's objective during the Collection phase, after the Discovery phase has already occurred.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** is more relevant to the Discovery phase, which has already happened according to the question.
   - **T1564.002-Hidden Users** is related to creating persistence or evading detection, not directly to collecting data.
   - Between **T1113-Screen Capture** and **T1056-Input Capture**, both could be used for collecting data. However, **T1056-Input Capture** is more directly related to collecting sensitive information that could be of interest to an adversary, such as login credentials or other sensitive data entered by users.
   - Given the context of the Collection phase and the objective of gathering extensive system information (potentially including sensitive user input), **T1056-Input Capture** seems the most likely technique to support the group's objective.

Final Answer: B
