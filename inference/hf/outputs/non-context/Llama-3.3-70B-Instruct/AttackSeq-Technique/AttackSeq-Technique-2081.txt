To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events described and analyze the ATT&CK techniques provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The sequence starts with users being redirected to compromised sites or advertising pages that execute RIG exploits (RIG Exploit Kit) via malvertising.
   - After the exploitation, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - The purpose of the script is to fetch malware from the Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial step involves exploitation (via RIG EK), which aligns with **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**. This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute malicious code.
   - Running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware suggests the use of scripting for execution, which could be related to several techniques but is most directly related to executing code on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code in existing cloud infrastructure without provisioning or managing servers. While PowerShell can be used in cloud environments, the context provided doesn't directly suggest serverless execution in a cloud service.
   - **B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This has already occurred as part of the initial exploitation by RIG EK, making it less likely to be the answer since we're looking for what happens after the exploitation.
   - **C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software or tools that can be used to support malicious activities. Fetching malware from a C&C infrastructure aligns with obtaining capabilities to further the attack.
   - **D: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. While this could be a method of executing code, the question specifically mentions fetching malware, which is broader than just DLL side-loading.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The exploitation has already occurred, so we're looking for what happens next in the sequence.
   - Running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware indicates the attacker is looking to obtain additional capabilities to further their goals.
   - **T1588-Obtain Capabilities** directly aligns with the action of fetching malware from a C&C infrastructure, as it involves obtaining software (malware in this case) to support further malicious activities.

**Final Answer: C**
