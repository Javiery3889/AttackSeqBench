To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The "Red October" campaign refers to a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign discovered in 2013, which targeted diplomatic, governmental, and scientific organizations. The attackers used a complex framework of malware components to exfiltrate sensitive information.

2. **Identifying Key Elements**: The question mentions the main component establishing communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers and receiving additional spy modules. This implies a need for the attackers to hide the location of their C&C servers (referred to as the "mothership" server) to avoid detection and maintain the campaign's longevity.

3. **Analyzing ATT&CK Techniques**:
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it can be used for various malicious activities, it doesn't directly relate to hiding server locations.
   - **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: Dead drop resolvers are used in the context of domain name system (DNS) tunneling or other methods to resolve domains that are used as dead drops for command and control. This could potentially be used to obscure C&C communications but is more about resolving domains rather than directly hiding server locations.
   - **T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the true location of the C&C server. Proxies can be used to relay commands and data between the malware and the C&C server, making it difficult to determine the actual location of the C&C server.
   - **T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**: This technique involves modifying the Windows logon process to load a malicious DLL, which can be used for persistence or to capture credentials. It does not directly relate to hiding the location of C&C servers.

4. **Evaluating the Options**: Given the need to hide the location of the "mothership" server during the "Red October" campaign, the most relevant technique would be one that directly supports obscuring or proxying the communication between the malware and the C&C server.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, **T1090-Proxy** is the most likely technique used to hide the location of the C&C server. This technique directly addresses the need to obscure the location of command and control servers by using a proxy, which aligns with the requirement to protect the "mothership" server's location.
