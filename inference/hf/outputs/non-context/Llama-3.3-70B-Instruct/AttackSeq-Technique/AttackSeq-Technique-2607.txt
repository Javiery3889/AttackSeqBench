To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker (NanHaiShu) is gathering and uploading system information to a Command and Control (C&C) server. The communication with the C&C server is established initially with IP addresses hosted in the United States, which later switch to a Chinese IP address. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely employed to establish this communication initially.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the establishment of communication with C&C servers and the dynamic nature of the IP addresses used (initially U.S.-hosted, then switching to a Chinese IP address). The technique we're looking for should involve setting up or facilitating communication with C&C servers, potentially involving domain name resolution or similar mechanisms that could allow for such dynamic changes.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A & B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves the adversary dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses to establish communication with C&C servers. Given that the IP addresses for the C&C servers change (from U.S.-hosted to Chinese), a dynamic resolution technique would be necessary to maintain communication without hardcoding IP addresses. This technique fits well with the scenario described.
   - **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is about decoding or deobfuscating files or information that the adversary uses during an operation. While important for understanding certain types of malware or encoded communications, it doesn't directly relate to establishing communication with C&C servers based on dynamic IP address resolution.
   - **D: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input via a web portal, which doesn't directly relate to the establishment of C&C communication channels or the dynamic resolution of IP addresses for such purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario involves dynamic changes in IP addresses for C&C servers.
   - The technique must facilitate communication with these servers despite the changes.
   - Dynamic resolution (T1568) directly addresses the need to resolve domain names or IP addresses dynamically, which fits the scenario of changing IP addresses for C&C servers.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the information and the process of elimination, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for establishing communication with the C&C servers, considering the dynamic nature of the IP addresses, is related to dynamic resolution. However, since both A and B are labeled as T1568-Dynamic Resolution and there's no distinction provided between them in terms of additional details or sub-techniques, we must select one based on the information given. 

**Final Answer: A**
