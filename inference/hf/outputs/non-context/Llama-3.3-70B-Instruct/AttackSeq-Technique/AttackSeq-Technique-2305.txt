To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an adversary uses credential stuffing to gain access to a victim's VPN, Citrix, or other network entry points. Credential stuffing is a technique where attackers use automated tools to try a large number of usernames and passwords to gain access to an account. The question asks for the MITRE ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated this tactic to gain access to these services.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactic described involves gaining access through credential stuffing, which implies the use of valid or compromised credentials to access remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid credentials to access systems or services. Given that credential stuffing relies on using valid username and password combinations (either obtained through previous breaches, phishing, or other means), this technique aligns closely with the described scenario.
   - **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**: This sub-technique is related to hiding malicious email activity and does not directly relate to gaining access to network services through credential stuffing.
   - **C: T1200-Hardware Additions**: This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access or control, which does not align with the credential stuffing tactic described.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which, while potentially useful in the reconnaissance phase of an attack, does not directly facilitate gaining access through credential stuffing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the MITRE ATT&CK technique that facilitated gaining access to remote services through credential stuffing.
   - Credential stuffing relies on using valid or compromised credentials.
   - T1078-Valid Accounts is the technique that directly involves using valid credentials to access systems or services, which aligns with the outcome of a successful credential stuffing attack.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this context starts with the use of valid accounts to access the services after credential stuffing has provided the necessary credentials.

Final Answer: A
