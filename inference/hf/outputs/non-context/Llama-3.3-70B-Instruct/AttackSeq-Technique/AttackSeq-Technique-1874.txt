To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services to communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers. Specifically, it mentions the use of Pastebin or Google+ for this communication. The question asks us to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated this communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the use of legitimate services (like Pastebin or Google+) for C2 communication, which implies using web services as a means to hide or facilitate malicious communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves storing credentials in files, which doesn't directly relate to using web services for C2 communication.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: While obfuscation can be a part of evading detection, the question specifically mentions communication through web services, not just obfuscating files or information.
   - **C: T1001.002-Steganography**: Steganography involves hiding data within other data, which could be a method for hiding C2 communications, but the question points more towards using existing web services rather than embedding data within other files or communications.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C2 communication, which aligns with the scenario described in the question, where Pastebin or Google+ (both web services) are used for communication with C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of legitimate third-party online services (Pastebin or Google+) for C2 communication.
   - The ATT&CK framework's **T1102-Web Service** technique directly involves using web services for Command and Control, which matches the described scenario.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs given the context is using web services for C2 communication.

Final Answer: D
