To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the initial actions of keylogging and RAM scraping by FastPOS, let's analyze the given options in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the described attack sequence.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines an attack sequence where FastPOS malware has already employed keylogging and RAM scraping to steal information. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that most likely followed under the Collection tactic before the stolen credit card information was transmitted to the attacker.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial actions (keylogging and RAM scraping) are techniques used for collecting sensitive information. Keylogging involves capturing keystrokes, which can reveal passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. RAM scraping involves extracting data from the memory of running applications, which can include credit card information not stored on disk.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to get a list of running processes to understand the system's architecture. While useful for an attacker, it doesn't directly follow the collection of sensitive data via keylogging and RAM scraping in terms of logical sequence aimed at exfiltrating stolen credit card information.
   - **B: T1115-Clipboard Data**: This involves capturing the clipboard contents, which could potentially include sensitive information. However, given the context of keylogging and RAM scraping, this seems less directly related to the immediate transmission of stolen credit card information.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores. While related to collecting sensitive information, the question's context suggests a focus on credit card information rather than credentials.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique directly relates to capturing user input, which aligns with keylogging. Given that keylogging is mentioned, and the focus is on collecting credit card information, this seems like a redundant step in the sequence described. However, considering the context of immediately transmitting stolen credit card information, the question seems to be looking for a technique that aligns with the collection of such specific data.

Given the context and the techniques described, **T1056-Input Capture** seems closely related to the actions of keylogging, which is already part of the sequence. However, considering the aim is to identify a technique that follows keylogging and RAM scraping in the context of collecting and then transmitting credit card information, we need to think about what would logically come next in the sequence of collecting sensitive data before exfiltration.

Upon closer inspection, **T1056-Input Capture** (keylogging) is already part of the initial actions, making **D** a less likely choice as a separate step following itself. The question seems to be about identifying a step in the collection process that precedes exfiltration, given the initial data collection methods.

Considering the logical flow and the goal of collecting credit card information for immediate transmission, none of the provided options perfectly fit the expected sequence as a direct next step after keylogging and RAM scraping, especially in the context of the Collection tactic aimed at credit card information. However, the question's framing suggests looking for a technique that aligns with further collection or handling of sensitive data before transmission.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial TTPs: Keylogging and RAM scraping for collecting sensitive information.
2. Consider the goal: Collecting credit card information for immediate transmission.
3. Evaluate options:
   - **A, B, C** seem less directly related to the immediate next step after keylogging and RAM scraping in the context of transmitting credit card information.
   - **D** seems redundant given keylogging is already mentioned.

Given the context and focusing strictly on the Collection tactic for credit card information, the question's options don't perfectly align with typical next steps after keylogging and RAM scraping aimed at credit card data collection. However, if we must choose based on the closest relation to collecting input (like credit card numbers) which could be immediately transmitted:

**Final Answer: D**
