To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where a vulnerability in Microsoft Office is exploited to install malware. After the installation, the malware (Taidoor) starts beaconing to a Command and Control (CnC) server using an HTTP GET request pattern. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this beaconing activity.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial step involves exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, which aligns with the technique of exploiting a public-facing application (this could be related to T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application, though it's not directly listed as an option). The next step mentioned is the beaconing to a CnC server, which is a form of Command and Control (C2) communication, often associated with techniques like T1071 - Application Layer Protocol, given the use of HTTP GET requests.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application-layer protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the beaconing activity described. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred **before** the beaconing.
   - **B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**: This involves compromising software dependencies or development tools, which doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of a Microsoft Office vulnerability or the subsequent C2 communication.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used to trick users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. Given that the initial vector involves exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (potentially through a malicious document or attachment), phishing could be a plausible initial step to get the victim to open the malicious document, thus leading to the exploitation.
   - **D: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API**: This technique involves accessing cloud instance metadata to gather information. It doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office or the subsequent beaconing activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The exploitation of a Microsoft Office vulnerability to install malware suggests an initial step that involves either social engineering (to get the user to open a malicious document) or direct exploitation.
   - Given the choices, **T1566-Phishing** is the most plausible technique that could have occurred before the exploitation and the subsequent beaconing. Phishing could be used to trick a user into opening a malicious Office document, which then exploits a vulnerability, leading to the installation of malware like Taidoor.
   - The other options either describe actions that occur after the initial exploitation (like beaconing) or are unrelated to the described sequence.

**Final Answer: C**
