To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises were used to gain access, resulting in customized Poison Ivy server code being executed on the target system, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises. This indicates the adversary is using social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the target system. This aligns with techniques like T1566-Phishing for the initial access vector.

2. **Execution of Customized Poison Ivy Server Code**: After gaining access, the customized Poison Ivy server code is executed on the target system. Poison Ivy is a type of remote access tool (RAT) that allows attackers to control the compromised system remotely. The execution of such code typically follows the initial access and is a method of establishing persistence and control over the compromised system.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**: This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for remote access. While it could be used post-compromise for lateral movement or to maintain access, it doesn't directly relate to the execution of customized malware like Poison Ivy.

- **B: T1199-Trusted Relationship**: This technique involves exploiting a trusted relationship between the victim and a third party to gain access. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of malware post-compromise.

- **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code in response to specific events. While it could be relevant in some contexts of malware execution, it's not the most direct match for the scenario described, which focuses on the initial execution of customized malware post-compromise.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique used for the initial access vector as described in the question. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred after the initial access, resulting in the execution of customized Poison Ivy server code.

Considering the execution of customized Poison Ivy server code as a result of the initial compromise, none of the provided choices directly describe the execution of malware. However, the closest in the context of post-compromise activities, especially considering the need for the malware to be executed and potentially maintained, would involve techniques related to execution and persistence. Since the question specifically mentions the execution of customized malware (Poison Ivy) post-compromise and none of the options directly address this, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the framing of the question and the provided options.

However, if we are to choose based on the information given and the typical flow of an attack, **T1566-Phishing (D)** is mentioned as part of the initial access vector, but since we're looking for what happened after, and given the options provided don't perfectly align with the execution of malware like Poison Ivy, there's a bit of confusion. Normally, after phishing, an attacker would use a technique to execute their malware, but such a technique (like T1204 - User Execution) isn't listed among the choices provided.

Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the provided options and their relevance to post-compromise activities, none directly fit the "execution of customized Poison Ivy server code" as a consequence of the initial access methods described. However, since the question asks for a choice and based on the typical sequence of events in an attack, the closest in terms of post-compromise activity (though not perfectly fitting) might involve considering how the attacker maintains access or executes code, but these specifics aren't well-represented in the options provided.

Final Answer: C
