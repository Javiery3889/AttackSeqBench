To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where the Duke group is exfiltrating sensitive information.
   - They are using legitimate cloud services for this purpose.
   - The communication with the C&C server is over encoded and encrypted HTTP/HTTPS channels, but the specific technique in question involves archiving and transmitting sensitive information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial communication is over secure HTTP/HTTPS, which could involve several techniques, but the focus is on the exfiltration method using cloud services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltration over non-standard protocols. While it could involve cloud services, the description doesn't specifically match using legitimate cloud services as the primary method of exfiltration.
   - **B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**: This involves collecting data from configuration repositories, which doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration of sensitive information via cloud services.
   - **C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data over web services, which can include cloud services. Given that the group is using legitimate cloud services to archive and transmit sensitive information, this seems like a strong candidate.
   - **D: T1585.003-Cloud Accounts**: This sub-technique involves using cloud accounts for persistence, which, while related to cloud services, doesn't specifically focus on the exfiltration of data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of legitimate cloud services for archiving and transmitting sensitive information.
   - The focus is on the method of exfiltration rather than the initial C&C communication or persistence within the cloud.
   - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** directly addresses exfiltration using web services, which includes cloud services, making it the most relevant technique given the scenario.

**Final Answer: C**
