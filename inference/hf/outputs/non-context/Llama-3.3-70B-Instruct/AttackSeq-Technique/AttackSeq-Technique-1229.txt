To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that attackers used anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process. This implies that the attackers are trying to hide their tracks or make it difficult for defenders to detect their malicious activities. The use of anti-forensics techniques is closely related to the concept of removing indicators of compromise (IOCs) or hiding malicious activity.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves the use of anti-forensics techniques, which is a method to evade detection. This is followed by an unknown technique from the ATT&CK framework that we need to identify based on the given options.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting weak permissions on executable installer files. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the use of anti-forensics or the immediate actions an attacker would take after trying to cover their tracks.
   - **B: T1137-Office Application Startup**: This technique involves using office application startup to establish persistence. It's a method for maintaining access but doesn't directly follow from the use of anti-forensics in terms of logical sequence.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique directly involves removing indicators of compromise, which aligns with the use of anti-forensics. If attackers are using anti-forensics during the dropper process, it makes sense that they would also attempt to remove indicators of their presence to further evade detection.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: Subverting trust controls involves manipulating trust mechanisms to gain access. While important, this action doesn't directly follow the logical sequence of using anti-forensics and then taking further actions to remain undetected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of anti-forensics techniques, which implies an attempt to hide or remove evidence of malicious activity.
   - The most logical next step after attempting to cover one's tracks would be to ensure that any indicators of compromise are removed, making **T1070-Indicator Removal** the most plausible next technique in the sequence.
   - This technique directly relates to the goal of remaining undetected and aligns with the actions described in the question.

Final Answer: C
