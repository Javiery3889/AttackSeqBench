To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of tools like Mimikatz for credential access, followed by the maintenance of access and evasion of defenses using the China Chopper webshell by Emissary Panda. This implies a sequence where initial access is gained, credentials are compromised (possibly using Mimikatz), and then a webshell is used to maintain access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The use of Mimikatz suggests credential access (T1003 - Credential Dumping).
   - The deployment and use of the China Chopper webshell for maintaining access and evading defenses suggest techniques related to persistence and defense evasion.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**: This technique involves modifying kernel callbacks to hide malicious activity, which is more related to defense evasion but doesn't directly relate to the sequence of gaining access and then using a webshell.
   - **B: T1112-Modify Registry**: Modifying the registry can be used for persistence, which aligns with maintaining access. However, it doesn't directly precede the use of a webshell in a typical attack sequence.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: Hiding artifacts is a defense evasion technique that could be used after establishing access and deploying tools like webshells, but it doesn't directly relate to the action of deploying a webshell for maintaining access.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to gain access or move laterally within a network. The deployment of a webshell, like China Chopper, can be considered a form of software deployment for maintaining access and executing commands.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question implies an initial phase of credential access (using Mimikatz).
   - The next logical step in the sequence, given the context of maintaining access and using a webshell, would involve deploying or using tools that facilitate persistence and command execution.
   - Among the given options, **T1072-Software Deployment Tools** most closely aligns with the action of deploying a webshell (like China Chopper) as a means to maintain access and execute commands on a compromised system.

**Final Answer: D**
