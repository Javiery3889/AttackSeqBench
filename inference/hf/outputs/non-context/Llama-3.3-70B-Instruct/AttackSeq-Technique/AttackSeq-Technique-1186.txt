To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions a sequence of actions starting with a backdoor function gathering machine information during the Discovery phase.
   - It then asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to further extract visual data from the victim's system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action is the gathering of machine information, which is part of the Discovery phase.
   - The next action involves extracting visual data, implying a need to capture or record the screen or specific visual elements from the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim's system, which directly aligns with extracting visual data. It's a plausible next step after initial discovery to gather more specific or sensitive information.
   - **B: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities**: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities, which doesn't directly relate to extracting visual data but rather to gaining access or escalating privileges.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique is about using web services to establish a command and control channel, not directly related to extracting visual data.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence**: This option seems unrelated to the context provided, as it doesn't directly pertain to extracting visual data or the typical next steps after the Discovery phase in the way screen capture does.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely used to extract visual data after the initial discovery.
   - Extracting visual data implies a need for screen capture or a similar method to visually inspect or record the victim's system.
   - Among the given options, **T1113-Screen Capture** is the most direct method for achieving this goal.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial discovery and gathering of machine information would involve screen capture to extract visual data.

Final Answer: A
