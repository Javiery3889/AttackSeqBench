To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before APT41 collected source code and digital certificates from game production environments, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT41, after moving laterally within targeted networks (which includes pivoting between Windows and Linux systems), collected source code and digital certificates from game production environments. The lateral movement and the collection of specific data suggest that the attackers had already gained access to the network and were in the process of escalating their privileges or gathering valuable data.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implies an initial access phase, followed by lateral movement (which could involve techniques like T1021 - Remote Services, or T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material, among others), and then the collection of sensitive data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1213 - Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting a service that is available remotely, which could be a plausible initial access vector or a method for lateral movement, potentially leading to the collection of source code and digital certificates.
   - **B: T1113 - Screen Capture**: While screen capture could be used to gather information, it's less likely to be the technique that directly precedes the collection of source code and digital certificates on a large scale, as it's more related to capturing visual data from a user's screen.
   - **C: T1639 - Content Injection**: This technique is not directly related to the initial access or the actions described (collecting source code and digital certificates), as it involves injecting content into a user's web application.
   - **D: T1566 - Phishing**: Phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information or executing malicious code. It's a plausible first step in gaining access to a network, which could then lead to lateral movement and data collection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers need to gain initial access to the network.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a common method for initial access, allowing attackers to trick users into divulging credentials or executing malicious code.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers moved laterally and collected sensitive data, which aligns with the actions described.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context that the attackers were able to move laterally within the network and collect specific data, the most likely initial technique that led to this scenario is phishing, as it provides a common vector for initial access.

Final Answer: D
