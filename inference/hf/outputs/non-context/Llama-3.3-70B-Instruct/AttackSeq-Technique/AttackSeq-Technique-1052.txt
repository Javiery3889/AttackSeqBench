To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Darkhotel APT used digital certificates to sign their backdoors for bypassing defenses, involving encryption and storage of gathered data in log files, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the use of digital certificates to sign backdoors, which implies an attempt to make malicious software appear legitimate (a technique often associated with defense evasion). It also mentions the involvement of encryption and the storage of gathered data in log files, suggesting actions taken post-compromise to maintain access and exfiltrate data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with the use of signed backdoors (implying a defense evasion technique) and involves data encryption and storage, likely for exfiltration or further analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the search order used by the operating system to load DLLs, allowing an adversary to load a malicious DLL. While this could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the actions described (using digital certificates, encryption, and storing data in log files).
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This involves obtaining credentials from password stores. It could be a step in an attack to gain further access but doesn't directly follow from the described actions of using signed backdoors and managing gathered data.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising software supply chains, which could include signing backdoors with digital certificates to make them appear legitimate. However, this choice seems more about the initial compromise rather than actions taken after the backdoor is in place.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection, which aligns with the use of digital certificates to sign backdoors (making them appear legitimate) and the encryption and storage of gathered data in a way that might avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of digital certificates to sign backdoors indicates an attempt to evade defenses by making the backdoor appear legitimate.
   - The encryption and storage of gathered data suggest further actions to maintain stealth and prepare for data exfiltration.
   - Among the provided choices, **T1564-Hide Artifacts** most directly aligns with the goal of evading detection after initial compromise and data collection, as it involves techniques that could be used to conceal the presence of the backdoor, the encryption used, and the log files containing gathered data.

**Final Answer: D**
