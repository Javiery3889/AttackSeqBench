To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts. 
   - After these actions, the attacker establishes communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves initial discovery and manipulation, followed by communication establishment.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy (A)**: This technique involves using an external proxy to mask the attacker's IP address. While it could be used in conjunction with establishing communication, it doesn't directly relate to the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for communication itself.
   - **T1498-Network Denial of Service (B)**: This technique is about causing a denial-of-service condition on a network, which does not align with establishing communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol (C)**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for communication. Given the context of establishing communication using these protocols, this seems highly relevant.
   - **T1106-Native API (D)**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While it could be part of the initial discovery and manipulation phase, it doesn't directly relate to establishing communication over HTTP and HTTPS.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the goal of the attacker after the initial discovery and manipulation, which is to establish communication.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that the communication is specifically over HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
   - **Step 3**: Match the goal with the provided ATT&CK techniques to find the best fit.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the focus on using HTTP and HTTPS for communication, the most relevant technique is the one directly associated with the use of application layer protocols for this purpose.

Final Answer: C
