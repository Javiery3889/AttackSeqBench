To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a victim is tricked into interacting with a malicious link that leads to trojanized files, supposedly as part of 'Know Your Customer' banking procedures. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable the removal of attack artifacts through a script named 'DeleteLeftovers'.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Initial Access: Through a malicious link leading to trojanized files.
   - The removal of attack artifacts using a script named 'DeleteLeftovers'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. The use of a script named 'DeleteLeftovers' to remove attack artifacts could be facilitated by this technique, as it involves executing a script.
   - **B: T1585-Establish Accounts**: This technique is about creating accounts that can be used to maintain access. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of scripts for removing artifacts.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel. While it's about data transfer, it doesn't directly relate to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This is a sub-technique of T1059, specifically involving the use of the Windows Command Shell. Given that 'DeleteLeftovers' is a script, and if we assume it's executed in a Windows environment, this could be a plausible choice.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the execution of a script ('DeleteLeftovers') to remove attack artifacts. This implies the use of a command or scripting interpreter.
   - Between options A and D, both could potentially be correct, but D (T1059.003-Windows Command Shell) is more specific to the Windows environment and directly involves the execution of commands or scripts, which aligns well with the scenario of running a script named 'DeleteLeftovers'.
   - Given the specificity of D to the Windows environment and the direct involvement of script execution, it seems more directly related to the described action of removing attack artifacts through a script.

5. **Final Answer**: 
Given the information and the focus on script execution in a likely Windows environment for removing attack artifacts, the most appropriate answer is:
**Final Answer: D**
