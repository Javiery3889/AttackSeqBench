To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malicious macros are injected into Word and Excel documents on a compromised system.
   - It mentions Gamaredon sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial action involves compromising a system and injecting malicious macros into documents, which could be related to techniques like "T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment" or similar, but this is not directly listed as an option.
   - The key action in the question is sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the organization, which is a form of spearphishing.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1546.002-Screensaver:** This technique involves using a screensaver to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to sending emails with malicious attachments.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves tricking a user into executing malicious code. While related to social engineering, it's broader and doesn't specifically match the action of sending emails with malicious attachments.
   - **C: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM):** This technique involves using DCOM for lateral movement. It doesn't directly relate to the initial compromise via email attachments.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique specifically involves spearphishing that is targeted internally within an organization, which aligns with sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the action of sending emails with malicious attachments within an organization.
   - The most relevant technique from the ATT&CK framework that matches this action is internal spearphishing, as it involves targeting individuals within the same organization, typically through emails.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred, given the context of sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the organization, is internal spearphishing.

**Final Answer: D**
