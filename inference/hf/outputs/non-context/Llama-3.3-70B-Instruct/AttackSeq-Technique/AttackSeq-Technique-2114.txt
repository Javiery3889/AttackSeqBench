To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where threat actors have acquired servers, either through compromise or legitimate purchase, and are using these servers to configure malicious infrastructure for Command and Control (C2) purposes. This implies the threat actors are setting up infrastructure to control compromised systems or networks remotely.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the acquisition of servers and the configuration of these servers for C2 purposes. This suggests we are looking for a technique related to establishing or using infrastructure for command and control communications.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending malicious attachments via email to gain initial access. It doesn't directly relate to configuring servers for C2 purposes.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software, tools, or expertise to support operations. While it could be related to setting up C2 infrastructure, it's more about acquiring capabilities rather than using them for C2.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services for C2 communications, which aligns closely with the scenario of configuring servers for C2 purposes. Threat actors might use externally controlled services (like cloud services) to host their C2 infrastructure.
   - **D: T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups**: This technique involves adding accounts to local or domain groups to escalate privileges, which doesn't directly relate to configuring servers for C2 purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario involves setting up infrastructure for C2, which suggests the use of external services for command and control.
   - T1133-External Remote Services directly relates to using external services, which could include compromised or purchased servers, for C2 communications.
   - The other options either relate to initial access (A), capability acquisition (B), or privilege escalation (D), which are not directly related to the use of servers for C2 purposes.

**Final Answer: C**
