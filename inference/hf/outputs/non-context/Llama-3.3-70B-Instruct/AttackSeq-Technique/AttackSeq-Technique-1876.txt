To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before FIN13 established initial access, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions FIN13 establishing initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks. This implies that before gaining initial access, some form of reconnaissance or preparation might have been necessary to identify vulnerabilities or to set up the conditions for the exploit.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique mentioned in the question is related to establishing initial access, which is often preceded by reconnaissance or other preparatory activities.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1596.004-CDNs**: This technique involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for phishing or other malicious activities. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the preparation for exploiting external servers.
   - **B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This is a technique used for persistence and privilege escalation, which would typically occur after initial access has been gained.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into a victim network, which could be a step after initial access or as part of establishing a foothold but doesn't necessarily precede the initial exploitation.
   - **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which could include identifying potential vulnerabilities in external servers or understanding the network layout to plan an attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **before** establishing initial access.
   - Establishing initial access through exploiting external servers suggests that some form of reconnaissance or information gathering would be necessary to identify vulnerable servers or understand how to leverage web shells effectively.
   - Among the given options, **Gather Victim Network Information (T1590)** is the most directly related to the preparatory phase of an attack, where an adversary would gather information necessary to plan and execute the initial access phase effectively.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the need for reconnaissance or information gathering before exploiting external servers to establish initial access, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve gathering information about the victim's network.

Final Answer: D
