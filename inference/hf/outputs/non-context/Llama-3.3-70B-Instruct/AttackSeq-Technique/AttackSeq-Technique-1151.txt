To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, referred to as GroundPeony, uses DLL side-loading to evade defenses and launch shellcode from a file named "mic.doc". After this initial step, GroundPeony establishes communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server via "app.onedrivo.com". We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this communication establishment.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial step involves DLL side-loading, which is a technique used to evade defenses by loading malicious DLLs. This is followed by the establishment of communication with a C&C server, which suggests a technique related to command and control.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves using software that allows for remote access to a system, but it doesn't directly relate to establishing communication with a C&C server via a web service.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique is about using shared modules, which doesn't directly apply to the scenario of establishing C&C communication.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for command and control, which aligns with establishing communication with a C&C server via a web-based interface or service, such as "app.onedrivo.com".
   - **D: T1557.004-Evil Twin**: This technique involves impersonating a legitimate Wi-Fi access point, which doesn't fit the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial action of using DLL side-loading to launch shellcode indicates an attempt to evade defenses and gain access to a system.
   - The subsequent action of establishing communication with a C&C server indicates the need for the attacker to control the compromised system remotely.
   - Given that the communication is established via "app.onedrivo.com", which appears to be a web-based service, the most relevant ATT&CK technique would be one that involves using web services for command and control.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the technique that most likely occurred when GroundPeony established communication with the C&C server via "app.onedrivo.com" is related to using web services for command and control.

Final Answer: C
