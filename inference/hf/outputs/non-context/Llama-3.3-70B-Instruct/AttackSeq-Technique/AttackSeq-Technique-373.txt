To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with the exploitation of a Microsoft Office vulnerability, CVE-2012-0158. This is a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution, which the attackers use to gain initial access to the system.

2. **Execution and Persistence**: After gaining access, the attackers use BBSRAT (a remote access trojan) and employ process hollowing as a technique to execute their malware. Process hollowing involves replacing the contents of a legitimate process with malicious code, allowing the malware to masquerade as a legitimate process.

3. **Execution Strategy**: The question specifies that BBSRAT leverages the legitimate Citrix executable `ssonsvr.exe` as part of its execution strategy. This implies that the attackers are using a legitimate system process or tool to execute their malicious code, which is a common technique to evade detection.

Given these details, let's evaluate the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

- **A: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to execute malicious code. Since `ssonsvr.exe` is a legitimate system executable and the attackers are leveraging it for malicious purposes, this technique seems relevant.

- **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to gain execution. While the use of `ssonsvr.exe` could be seen as leveraging a tool, it's more about executing code under the guise of a legitimate system service rather than deploying software.

- **C: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**: This technique involves manipulating the boot process to execute code before the operating system loads. The scenario described does not indicate any manipulation of the boot process.

- **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing code automatically at system boot or user logon. While persistence is a goal, the specific action described (leveraging `ssonsvr.exe`) does not directly relate to achieving execution at boot or logon.

Based on the analysis, the most relevant technique to the described scenario is **A: T1569-System Services**, as it directly involves using a legitimate system service (`ssonsvr.exe`) to execute malicious code, aligning with the process hollowing and execution strategy mentioned.

Final Answer: A
