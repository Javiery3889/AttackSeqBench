To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers bypass process-level restrictions and inject malicious code into trusted processes using the AtomBombing technique.
   - The AtomBombing technique is a method of injecting code into processes by leveraging Windows atom tables, which are used by the operating system for inter-process communication (IPC) and other purposes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves scheduling a task to execute at a specific time or interval using cron jobs, which is not directly related to the AtomBombing technique or leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms like atom tables.
   - **B: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**: This technique is specific to macOS and involves hijacking dynamic libraries to execute malicious code, which does not match the context of using Windows atom tables.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to execute system-level functions, which could potentially include manipulating Windows mechanisms. However, it's broader and does not specifically relate to the AtomBombing technique or atom tables.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into running processes, which aligns with the description of using the AtomBombing technique to inject malicious code into trusted processes by leveraging Windows atom tables.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The AtomBombing technique specifically involves injecting malicious code into processes by exploiting Windows atom tables.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely enabled attackers to execute malicious code by leveraging such Windows mechanisms.
   - T1055-Process Injection directly relates to injecting code into processes, which is what the AtomBombing technique achieves.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves process injection.

Final Answer: D
