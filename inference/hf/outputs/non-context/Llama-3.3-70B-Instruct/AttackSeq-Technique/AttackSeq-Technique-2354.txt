To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence involving BRONZE PRESIDENT, a group known for its association with PRC-based infrastructure development. The initial access vector mentioned is phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred involving the use of PlugX and other tools linked to this group.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The question implies a sequence where initial access is gained (likely through phishing), and then certain tools (like PlugX) are used. PlugX is a remote access tool (RAT) known for its use in various cyber espionage campaigns.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities, which could include creating or obtaining malware like PlugX. However, it's more about the development phase rather than the deployment or use of such tools.
   - **B: T1584.007-Serverless**: This technique involves using serverless computing for malicious purposes. While it could be related to the infrastructure used by threat actors, it doesn't directly relate to the use of PlugX or the described sequence.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to gain access to a network. Given that PlugX is a RAT, its use aligns with establishing remote access to compromised systems, making this a plausible choice.
   - **D: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**: This technique involves exploiting unquoted paths in Windows for privilege escalation or other malicious purposes. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the use of PlugX or the initial access vector described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question hints at the use of specific malware (PlugX) and its association with PRC-based infrastructure development.
   - The initial access vector (phishing with LNK files) suggests a method to gain initial foothold.
   - The use of PlugX, a RAT, implies the establishment of remote access to the compromised system.
   - Among the given options, **T1021-Remote Services** is the most directly related to the use of a RAT like PlugX for establishing remote access.

**Final Answer: C**
