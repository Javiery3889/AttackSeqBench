To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a JavaScript file creates an executable ('d3reEW.exe') that uses the command 'cmd /c ipconfig' to discover IP address information. This action is followed by the need to enable HTTPS communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable this HTTPS communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial action involves creating an executable to gather network information (IP address discovery), which is a precursor to establishing communication with a C&C server. The techniques mentioned in the choices relate to different aspects of network communication and system interaction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application-layer protocols for communication. Given that HTTPS is an application-layer protocol, using it for C&C communication fits this technique.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique is about scheduling tasks or jobs to execute at a specific time or interval, which doesn't directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This sub-technique involves using an internal proxy to direct traffic, which could be related to communication but is more about routing traffic internally rather than enabling HTTPS.
   - **D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This sub-technique is about discovering internet connectivity, which is somewhat related to the initial action of discovering IP address information but doesn't directly pertain to enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial action of discovering IP address information suggests the adversary is setting up for communication.
   - Enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server implies the use of a specific application-layer protocol for secure communication.
   - Among the given choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** directly relates to using protocols like HTTPS for communication purposes.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of enabling HTTPS communication for C&C server interaction, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique is related to the use of application-layer protocols.

Final Answer: A
