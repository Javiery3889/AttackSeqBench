To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the CEIDPageLock rootkit has already been installed on a victim's system. It has gathered browsing data, indicating it has some level of access and control. The next step involves the rootkit establishing communication with its command and control (C&C) servers to download a homepage configuration. This implies the rootkit needs to communicate with external servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key action here is the establishment of communication between the compromised system (where the rootkit is installed) and the C&C servers. This communication is necessary for the rootkit to receive further instructions or download additional components, in this case, the homepage configuration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1213.004 - Customer Relationship Management Software**: This technique involves the use of customer relationship management (CRM) software for persistence. It doesn't directly relate to establishing communication with C&C servers.
   - **B: T1205 - Traffic Signaling**: This technique is not directly related to the described action of a rootkit communicating with C&C servers to download configurations.
   - **C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for communication. Given that the rootkit needs to communicate with its C&C servers over the internet (likely using HTTP, HTTPS, or another application-layer protocol), this seems like a plausible choice.
   - **D: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a web browser when a user visits a malicious website. While it's a method of initial access, it doesn't directly relate to the communication between a rootkit and its C&C servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The rootkit has already been installed and is gathering data, indicating it's past the initial access phase.
   - The action of establishing communication with C&C servers for downloading configurations suggests the use of network protocols.
   - Among the given options, **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant to establishing communication over a network, as it involves using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS, which are commonly used for such communications.

**Final Answer: C**
