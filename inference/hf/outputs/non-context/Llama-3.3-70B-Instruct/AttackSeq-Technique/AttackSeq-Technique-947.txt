To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Sednit group's malware scanned for files matching specific extensions and staged data containing paths of files to exfiltrate, but before the group sent the data to the C&C server, let's analyze the given sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The sequence described involves the Sednit group's malware scanning for specific files, staging data for exfiltration, and then an unspecified action before sending the data to the Command and Control (C&C) server. The key actions here are file scanning, data staging, and the eventual exfiltration of data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned in the question implicitly include:
   - Scanning for files (which could be related to techniques like **T1083 - File and Directory Discovery**).
   - Staging data for exfiltration (related to **T1074 - Data Staged**).
   - The action we are trying to identify occurs after data staging but before exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1113 - Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which doesn't directly fit the sequence of staging data for exfiltration and then sending it to a C&C server.
   - **B: T1056.003 - Web Portal Capture**: This is a specific subtype of Input Capture, focusing on web portals. It doesn't directly relate to the described sequence of actions.
   - **C: T1070 - Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise. Given the context, after staging data for exfiltration, an attacker might attempt to cover their tracks by removing indicators of compromise before exfiltrating the data, making this a plausible step.
   - **D: T1599 - Network Boundary Bridging**: This technique is about establishing a bridge between two or more networks. It doesn't directly fit the sequence of actions related to data exfiltration described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Sednit group's actions are focused on data exfiltration.
   - After staging the data, the next logical step before exfiltration would be to ensure that the exfiltration process and the presence of the malware are not detected.
   - **T1070 - Indicator Removal** aligns with this goal by potentially removing evidence of the malware's activities, making it a logical step before exfiltrating the data to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: C**
