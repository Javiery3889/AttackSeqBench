To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after BADHATCH evaded detection and before the usage of the mimi.ps1 script for credential dumping, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - BADHATCH evaded detection by using TLS encryption and masquerading its communication as legitimate HTTP requests. This indicates the adversary has already gained some level of access and is attempting to maintain stealth.
   - The next step involves the usage of the mimi.ps1 script, which is speculated to relate to credential dumping. Credential dumping typically involves obtaining credentials from the system for further exploitation, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary searching for peripheral devices connected to the system. While it could be a part of the adversary's reconnaissance, it doesn't directly relate to the actions of evading detection and then moving towards credential dumping.
   - **B: T1600-Weaken Encryption**: This technique is about weakening the encryption mechanisms on the system. Given that the adversary is already using TLS encryption to evade detection, this option doesn't directly fit as a next step before credential dumping.
   - **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to identify the system's owners or users. This could be a plausible step after evading detection, as understanding the user landscape can help in identifying potential targets for credential dumping.
   - **D: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**: This involves modifying domain or tenant policies, which could be a step in privilege escalation or creating backdoors but seems less directly related to the immediate precursor actions to credential dumping.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The adversary has already evaded detection, indicating they are in a phase of the attack where they are trying to gather more information or prepare for further exploitation.
   - Credential dumping (as implied by the use of the mimi.ps1 script) is a step that benefits from knowing who the users are and potentially which users have the credentials of interest.
   - Among the given options, discovering system owners or users (T1033) aligns well with the preparatory phase for credential dumping, as it helps in targeting the right users for credential theft.

**Final Answer: C**
