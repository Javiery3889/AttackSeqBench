To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely involved in targeting specific details about potential victims during the Reconnaissance phase, before attackers gained Initial Access via phishing emails. The key elements here are the Reconnaissance phase and the action of targeting specific details about potential victims.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1137.001-Office Template Macros**: This technique involves using macros in office templates to execute malicious code. It is more related to the Execution tactic rather than the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **B: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**: This technique is related to scanning for passwords using wordlists, which is part of the Credential Access tactic, not directly related to gathering information about victims during Reconnaissance.
   - **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique directly involves collecting information about the victims, such as names, positions, or contact information, which can be used for targeted attacks like spear-phishing. This aligns well with the Reconnaissance phase and the context of preparing for a phishing campaign.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is about exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is related to the Exfiltration tactic and occurs after the initial access has been gained, not during the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the Reconnaissance phase and the action of gathering specific details about potential victims.
   - The correct technique should be related to gathering information rather than executing code, scanning for passwords, or exfiltrating data.
   - **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is the technique that directly involves gathering information about potential victims, which can be used to craft targeted phishing emails.
   - Therefore, this technique is the most plausible choice given the context of the question.

Final Answer: C
