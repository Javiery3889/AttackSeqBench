To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the execution of "mic.exe" for loading and decrypting associated files.
   - It also mentions decoding the "mic.ver" configuration file.
   - The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated communication with the Command and Control (C&C) server after these initial steps.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial step involves executing "mic.exe," which loads and decrypts files. This suggests an initial access or execution phase where malicious files are prepared for use.
   - Decoding the "mic.ver" configuration file implies that the attackers are setting up or configuring their tools for further operations, possibly including communication with a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves making data difficult to understand. While obfuscation might be used in various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly imply communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This is a sub-technique of T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) and specifically deals with encrypting or encoding files. The question mentions decrypting files, which is the reverse operation, but this choice doesn't directly address communication with a C&C server.
   - **C: T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using standard web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for communication. Given that the question asks about communication with a C&C server after initial setup, using web protocols is a common method for such communication.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique is broader and involves making files or information difficult to detect. While relevant to the initial steps of loading and decrypting files, it doesn't directly address the communication aspect with the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically asks about communication with a C&C server after the initial setup and configuration.
   - Techniques like data obfuscation (T1001) and obfuscated files or information (T1027) are relevant to the initial phases of an attack but don't directly relate to C&C communication.
   - Encrypted/Encoded File (T1027.013) is about file encryption/encoding, which, while relevant to the initial steps, doesn't directly address C&C communication.
   - Web Protocols (T1071.001) directly relate to how an attacker might communicate with a C&C server, especially after the initial setup and configuration are complete.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the focus on communication with a C&C server after the initial setup, the most appropriate technique from the provided choices is using web protocols for this communication.

Final Answer: C
