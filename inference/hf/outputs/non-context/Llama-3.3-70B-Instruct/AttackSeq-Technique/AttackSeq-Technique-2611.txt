To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the malware NanHaiShu, focusing on the period after it establishes persistence and before it communicates with Command and Control (C&C) servers.
   - The specific actions mentioned are modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry for persistence and communicating with C&C servers via dynamic DNS providers.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used for gathering specific system details from the infected machine during this period.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure (A)**: This technique involves using various methods to hide the infrastructure used in an attack, which doesn't directly relate to gathering system details from an infected machine.
   - **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery (B)**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to discover domain trusts, which could be part of system information gathering but is more specific to domain relationships rather than general system details.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (C)**: This technique is about achieving persistence, which is mentioned in the question but does not directly relate to gathering system information.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery (D)**: This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, hardware, and software configurations, which aligns with gathering specific system details.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the goal of the question, which is to determine the technique used for gathering system details after establishing persistence and before communicating with C&C servers.
   - **Step 2**: Analyze each option in the context of the question. Options A and C are related to hiding infrastructure and achieving persistence, respectively, which are not directly about gathering system information. Option B is about discovering domain trusts, which is a specific type of system information but might not encompass the broader scope of "specific system details" implied by the question.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that T1082-System Information Discovery directly addresses the gathering of system details, which would be necessary for the malware to understand its environment, plan further actions, and potentially report back to the C&C servers.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the goal of gathering system details, the most appropriate technique is T1082-System Information Discovery.

Final Answer: D
