To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have collected sensitive information from victims' devices. This information includes contact lists, geo-locations, and voice recordings. The attackers then use their infrastructure to transmit this stolen data back to themselves via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the collection of sensitive information and the transmission of this data back to the attackers using HTTP POST requests. The transmission of data, especially using a specific protocol like HTTP, indicates a technique related to communication and data exfiltration.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's system, allowing for the exchange of data. While it does involve communication, the specific mention of transmitting stolen data via HTTP POST requests suggests a focus on data exfiltration rather than bidirectional communication.
   - **B: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for communication. Given that the attackers are using HTTP POST requests to transmit stolen data, this technique directly aligns with the described action. HTTP is an application layer protocol, and using it for data exfiltration fits this technique.
   - **C: T1078 - Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems or data. While valid accounts might be used in the process of collecting sensitive information, the transmission of data via HTTP POST requests does not directly relate to the use of valid accounts.
   - **D: T1568.001 - Fast Flux DNS**: This technique involves rapidly changing the resolution of DNS entries to evade detection. While it could be part of an attacker's infrastructure for maintaining anonymity, it does not directly relate to the act of transmitting stolen data via HTTP POST requests.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the transmission of stolen data using HTTP POST requests.
   - The technique that most directly involves using specific protocols (like HTTP) for data transmission is T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is related to using an application layer protocol for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
