To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions downloading Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell. This indicates the use of a scripting interpreter to execute commands and scripts, which is a common technique used by attackers for various purposes, including establishing a foothold in a system.
   - It also mentions maintaining multi-beacon communication for evasion. This suggests the use of techniques to avoid detection, possibly by varying communication patterns.
   - The question specifically asks about establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs. This implies the creation of an encrypted or secure channel for communication.

2. **Identifying Relevant TTPs:**
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands and scripts. The mention of downloading Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell aligns with this technique, as PowerShell is a powerful scripting interpreter that can be used for executing scripts and commands.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves establishing a secure channel for communication. Given that the question mentions establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests, this could imply the use of encryption or other methods to secure the communication channel, fitting the description of creating an encrypted channel.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1654-Log Enumeration:** This technique involves collecting log data from various sources. It does not directly relate to establishing secure communication or downloading script functionalities.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** While relevant to the initial part of the scenario (downloading Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell), it does not directly address the establishment of secure communication.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This is a sub-technique under Encrypted Channel (T1573) that specifically involves using symmetric cryptography for encryption. While it could be part of establishing an encrypted channel, the question does not specifically mention the use of symmetric cryptography.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique directly addresses the establishment of a secure communication channel, which aligns with the part of the question about using HTTP GET requests to establish secure communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial action involves using PowerShell, which aligns with T1059.
   - The question's focus, however, is on establishing secure communication, which points towards the creation of an encrypted channel.
   - Given the information, T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant technique for establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests.

**Final Answer: D**
