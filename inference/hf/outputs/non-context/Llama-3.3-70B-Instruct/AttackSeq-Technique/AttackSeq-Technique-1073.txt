To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already executed shellcode to download and run 'dropper.dll.' This implies the attacker has gained initial access to the system. The goal now is to identify the technique that would allow malware backdoors to execute with system privileges before the attacker checks for security software to avoid detection.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Initial access and execution of malicious code (dropper.dll).
   - The need for privilege escalation to execute malware backdoors with system privileges.
   - Future plans to check for security software, indicating an intent to maintain access and avoid detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the system, which could be useful for various stages of an attack but does not directly relate to gaining system privileges for executing malware.
   - **B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique directly addresses the need to exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges, which aligns with the requirement for the malware backdoors to execute with system privileges.
   - **C: T1546.016-Installer Packages**: This sub-technique is about using installer packages for persistence, which, while relevant to maintaining access, does not directly address the need for privilege escalation.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This sub-technique involves using cloud services for command and control, which is not directly related to the local system privilege escalation needed for the described scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained initial access and is looking to escalate privileges.
   - The primary goal is to execute malware backdoors with system privileges.
   - Among the provided options, the technique that directly facilitates gaining higher privileges is exploitation for privilege escalation.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that occurred to allow malware backdoors to execute with system privileges is exploitation for privilege escalation.

Final Answer: B
