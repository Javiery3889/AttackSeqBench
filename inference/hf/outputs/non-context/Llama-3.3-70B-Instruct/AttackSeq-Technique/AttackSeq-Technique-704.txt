To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is a tool often used for command and control (C2) communications, indicating an adversary's attempt to maintain access to a compromised system.
   - The use of Base64 encoded PowerShell commands suggests an attempt to evade detection while executing commands on the compromised system.
   - The key detail is the hijacking of RegIdleBackup and alteration of its associated COM handler to maintain access. This implies modifying system components to ensure persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon and the use of encoded commands are about establishing and maintaining access.
   - The specific action of hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its COM handler is about persistence, which is a critical aspect of an adversary's strategy to remain within a compromised network without being detected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.009-Cloud API**: This technique involves using cloud services' APIs for command and control. While relevant to maintaining access, it doesn't directly relate to hijacking system components like RegIdleBackup.
   - **B: T1505.004-IIS Components**: This involves modifying Internet Information Services (IIS) components for persistence or C2. Although it's about altering system components, it's more specific to web server modifications, not directly related to RegIdleBackup.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks for execution, which can include modifying existing tasks or creating new ones to maintain access. Hijacking RegIdleBackup, a system component involved in scheduled backups, aligns closely with this technique as it involves altering system tasks for malicious purposes.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique is about exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain initial access, which doesn't directly relate to the actions described for maintaining access through system component hijacking.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on maintaining access through specific system modifications.
   - The action of hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its COM handler is a form of modifying system tasks or jobs to ensure the adversary remains within the system.
   - Among the provided choices, **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is the most relevant technique as it directly involves using or modifying scheduled tasks or system jobs, which aligns with the described action of hijacking and altering system components for persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
