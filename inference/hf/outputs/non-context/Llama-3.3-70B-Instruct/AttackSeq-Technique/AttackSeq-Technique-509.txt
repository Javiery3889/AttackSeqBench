To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor archiving collected data in a custom storage file format. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique most likely used to transfer the data from the victim's system after it has been collected and archived.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the collection and archiving of data by the SombRAT backdoor and the subsequent transfer of this data from the victim's system. The technique we're looking for involves data exfiltration, which is the process of transferring data from a system without authorization.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB**: This involves transferring data from a system using a USB drive. While possible, the context provided doesn't specifically mention the use of USB drives for data transfer.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules of code across different tools. It doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **C: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This technique is related to gathering information about a domain, which doesn't directly apply to the exfiltration of collected data.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves transferring data from a victim's system back to the attacker's command and control (C2) server over an established C2 channel. Given that SombRAT is a backdoor (which typically communicates with a C2 server), this option seems highly relevant.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies that data has been collected and archived by a backdoor, indicating a need for the data to be sent back to the attackers.
   - Backdoors like SombRAT typically communicate with a C2 server.
   - Exfiltrating data over a C2 channel is a common method for transferring stolen data back to the attackers, as it leverages the existing communication channel established by the backdoor.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of a backdoor being used to collect and archive data, and the need to transfer this data back to the attackers, the most plausible technique for this transfer would be over an established command and control channel.

Final Answer: D
