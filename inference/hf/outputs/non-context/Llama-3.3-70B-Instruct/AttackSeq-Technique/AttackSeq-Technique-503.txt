To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the CostaRicto Campaign, which employed defense evasion methods like process injection and deobfuscation to decode files related to SombRAT. After these actions, the attackers used pscan and nmap for network service scanning. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after these defense evasion methods but before the network service scanning.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - Defense evasion (process injection and deobfuscation).
   - Decoding files related to SombRAT.
   - Network service scanning using pscan and nmap.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1619-Cloud Storage Object Discovery**: This technique involves discovering cloud storage objects, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of decoding files and then scanning network services.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel could be a part of the attack, but it doesn't directly follow the decoding of files and the use of scanning tools like pscan and nmap.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network services, which aligns with the use of pscan and nmap for network service scanning. It's a logical step after initial compromise and defense evasion, as understanding the network services available is crucial for further exploitation.
   - **D: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**: This involves collecting data from cloud storage, which doesn't directly follow the sequence of decoding files related to SombRAT and then scanning network services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers first employed defense evasion techniques to decode files related to SombRAT, indicating an interest in understanding or exploiting the target environment.
   - After decoding these files, the next logical step would be to gather more information about the target network to identify potential vulnerabilities or services that could be exploited.
   - Network service scanning using tools like pscan and nmap is a common method for discovering available network services, which could be used for further exploitation or lateral movement within the network.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after the defense evasion methods and before the network service scanning is related to discovering network services.

**Final Answer: C**
