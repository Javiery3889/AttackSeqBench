To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration. This implies that an attacker has already gained access to the network and is looking to move data out of it. The question specifically asks about enabling communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments by leveraging a compromised router.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the use of a custom tunneling tool (which suggests the creation of a covert channel for data exfiltration) and the compromise of a router to facilitate communication between different network segments.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1070.006-Timestomp**: This technique involves modifying file timestamps to hide malicious activity, which does not directly relate to enabling communication between network segments or leveraging a compromised router.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to redirect traffic, which could be relevant in the context of leveraging a compromised router to enable communication between different network segments. A compromised router could act as a proxy to forward traffic.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which might be a precursor to exploiting vulnerabilities but does not directly involve using a compromised router to enable communication.
   - **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-standard protocols for communication, which could be relevant in the context of custom tunneling tools. However, it's more about the method of communication rather than enabling access between network segments via a compromised router.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on enabling communication between different network segments via a compromised router.
   - The use of a custom tunneling tool suggests the attacker is looking for ways to bypass normal communication channels.
   - Among the given options, **T1090-Proxy** is the most relevant to leveraging a compromised router to enable such communication, as it directly involves redirecting traffic, which could be necessary for communicating between corporate and restricted network segments.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of leveraging a compromised router to enable communication between network segments and considering the provided options, **B: T1090-Proxy** is the most plausible technique that aligns with the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: B
