To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in understanding and evaluating the given options in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the behavior of the Regin malware.

1. **Understanding Regin's Behavior**: Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its advanced capabilities, including remote access trojan (RAT) features such as capturing screenshots and monitoring network traffic. After collecting data, maintaining communication with its Command and Control (C2) infrastructure is crucial for exfiltrating the collected data and receiving further instructions.

2. **Identifying Relevant TTPs**:
   - **T1071: Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. Malware often uses standard protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **T1132.002: Non-Standard Encoding**: This is a sub-technique of Data Encoding, where data is encoded in a non-standard way to avoid detection. This could be used to hide the communication between the malware and the C2 server.
   - **T1040: Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information. While relevant to Regin's capabilities, it's more about data collection rather than maintaining C2 communication.
   - **T1134.005: SID-History Injection**: This technique is related to accessing credentials in Windows, specifically injecting SID-history to gain elevated privileges, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining C2 communication.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **Option A (T1071)**: This is a plausible method for Regin to communicate with its C2 infrastructure, as using application layer protocols can help the malware blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **Option B (T1132.002)**: Non-standard encoding could be used to hide the communication, making it a possible method for Regin to communicate with its C2 without being detected.
   - **Option C (T1040)**: While Regin uses network sniffing for data collection, this technique is not directly related to maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure.
   - **Option D (T1134.005)**: This technique is more related to privilege escalation and credential access rather than communication with C2 servers.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure after collecting data, the most relevant techniques would involve hiding or disguising this communication to avoid detection. Between the plausible options, **T1071: Application Layer Protocol** is a common method used by malware for C2 communication due to its ability to blend in with normal traffic, making it a strong candidate. However, considering the need for stealth and the fact that Regin is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, **T1132.002: Non-Standard Encoding** could also be highly relevant as it directly addresses the need to encode data in a way that avoids detection during communication with the C2.

**Final Answer: A**
