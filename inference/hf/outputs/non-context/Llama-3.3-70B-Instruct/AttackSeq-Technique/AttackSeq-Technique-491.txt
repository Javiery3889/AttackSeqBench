To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware, specifically a modular backdoor named "lightSpy," has established execution on a target system to install remote command capabilities. It mentions that the malware maintains evasion by exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the exploitation of a Safari bug and the use of a signed Apple developer certificate to maintain evasion. This implies a technique that involves subverting the trust that the system has in certain controls or certificates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it could be part of the attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to exploiting a Safari bug or using a signed Apple developer certificate for evasion.
   - **B: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing**: This technique is about spoofing DHCP responses to manipulate network traffic. It doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of a browser bug or the misuse of developer certificates.
   - **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting the trust that the system has in certain controls, such as digital certificates. Using a signed Apple developer certificate to evade detection fits well within this category, as it exploits the trust the system has in such certificates.
   - **D: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**: This technique is related to password attacks by reducing the key space to make brute-force attacks more feasible. It doesn't relate to the exploitation of browser bugs or the misuse of developer certificates.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on evasion techniques that involve exploiting a Safari bug and misusing a signed Apple developer certificate.
   - Exploiting a bug in Safari could be part of the initial exploitation phase but doesn't directly point to a specific ATT&CK technique without considering the context of evasion and certificate misuse.
   - The use of a signed Apple developer certificate for evasion purposes directly implies subverting the trust controls that the system has in place, making **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** the most relevant technique.

**Final Answer: C**
