To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers gained initial access by modifying a Javascript file (jquery-1.4.2.min.js) on the Afghan Government's CDN (Content Delivery Network) server. This action allowed them to load additional malicious code, which suggests a form of compromise that leverages user interaction or system vulnerabilities to gain access.

2. **Technique Used for Initial Access**: The modification of a Javascript file to load malicious code points towards a technique that involves exploiting user interaction or vulnerabilities in software to compromise systems. This is indicative of a **drive-by compromise**, where visiting a compromised website or accessing malicious content leads to the download and execution of malware.

3. **Evasion Technique**: The attackers then used the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to evade detection. This is an example of **obfuscating files or information** (T1027), as it involves making the malicious code difficult to understand or detect by security software.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack**: This involves manipulating a system to use an older, potentially vulnerable version of software. While it's a valid technique, it doesn't directly relate to the initial access method described (modifying a Javascript file to load malicious code).

- **B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It's more related to lateral movement within a network rather than the initial access method described.

- **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system by having them visit a website that contains malicious code, which matches the scenario of modifying a Javascript file to load additional malicious code.

- **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: While this is indeed the technique used for evasion (using Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding), the question asks for the technique that occurred **before** evasion, which is the initial access method.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with gaining initial access through a **drive-by compromise** (due to the modification of the Javascript file to load malicious code), followed by evasion techniques.

Final Answer: C
