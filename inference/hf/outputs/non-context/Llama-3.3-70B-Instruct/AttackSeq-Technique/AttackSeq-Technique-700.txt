To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and analyze the ATT&CK techniques provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where the Elderwood Project attackers used zero-day exploits delivered through spear phishing or web injections during watering hole attacks to gain initial access to their targets. This means the attackers have already gained access to the target system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial access was gained through exploits (likely T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, given the context of watering hole attacks and zero-day exploits). Now, we need to determine the most likely next step after gaining initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the attacker's IP address. While it could be used at various stages of an attack, it's not directly related to the immediate actions typically taken after gaining initial access through exploits.
   - **B & C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This is the technique used for initial access, as described in the question. It's unlikely to be the next step after initial access has already been gained through this method.
   - **D: T1036.004-Masquerade Task or Service**: This technique involves disguising a malicious task or service as a legitimate one, which could be a plausible next step after gaining initial access. Attackers often try to blend in with normal system activity to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have gained initial access, likely through exploiting public-facing applications (T1190).
   - The next logical step would involve establishing a foothold, evading detection, or beginning to move laterally within the network.
   - Masquerading tasks or services (T1036.004) would help in evading detection by making malicious activity appear as normal system operations.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of needing to blend in after gaining initial access, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence described would be to masquerade tasks or services to avoid detection.

Final Answer: D
