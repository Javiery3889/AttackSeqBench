To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection and created a hidden directory, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking, which is a technique to evade antivirus detection. This is related to **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**, as DLL hijacking is a form of hijacking execution flow by manipulating the way an application loads DLLs.
   - The creation of a hidden directory in the `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\` path suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity or files, potentially for persistence or to host additional malicious tools.
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **after** these actions.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves manipulating communication to evade detection or to convey commands. While it could be part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the actions described (DLL hijacking and creating a hidden directory).
   - **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This is the technique that involves hijacking the flow of an application's execution, which includes DLL hijacking. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred **after** DLL hijacking, suggesting we are looking for a subsequent action.
   - **C: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**: This technique involves creating a forged Kerberos ticket to access a system without being detected. While it's a method for gaining unauthorized access, it doesn't directly follow from the actions of DLL hijacking and creating a hidden directory as a necessary next step.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. Given that the attacker has already established a foothold (by evading detection and creating a hidden directory), communicating with a C2 server for further instructions or to exfiltrate data is a plausible next step.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial actions (DLL hijacking and creating a hidden directory) suggest the attacker is setting up for persistence or preparing to execute additional malicious activities.
   - The next logical step after establishing a hidden presence would be to communicate with a C2 server to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or upload additional tools.
   - Among the provided options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** best fits this scenario as it involves communication that could be necessary for the next stages of the attack.

**Final Answer: D**
