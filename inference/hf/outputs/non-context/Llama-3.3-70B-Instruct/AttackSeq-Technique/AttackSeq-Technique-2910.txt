To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions APT15 achieving persistence by installing the RoyalDNS backdoor after obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz. The key elements here are:
   - **Obtaining domain administrator credentials**: This implies a technique related to credential access.
   - **Using Mimikatz**: A tool commonly used for credential dumping, which aligns with techniques under Credential Access in the ATT&CK framework.
   - **Installing the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistence**: This action is about maintaining access, which is a separate technique but is a result of having the necessary access and credentials.

2. **Identifying Relevant Techniques**:
   - **Mimikatz** is typically associated with **T1003 - OS Credential Dumping**, which is not listed among the choices. However, the use of Mimikatz leads to obtaining credentials, which then can be used for other actions.
   - **T1078 - Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts (which could be obtained through various means, including credential dumping) to access systems. Given that the attackers have obtained domain administrator credentials, they would likely use these valid accounts to move laterally or install backdoors.
   - **T1213 - Data from Information Repositories**: This involves collecting data from repositories like file shares or databases, which doesn't directly relate to the action of installing a backdoor after obtaining credentials.
   - **T1546.008 - Accessibility Features**: This technique involves exploiting features intended for accessibility, which doesn't directly align with the described sequence of obtaining credentials and then installing a backdoor.
   - **T1606 - Forge Web Credentials**: This involves creating forged web credentials, which is not directly related to the use of obtained domain administrator credentials for installing a backdoor.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that the attackers have obtained domain administrator credentials, the most logical next step that aligns with installing a backdoor (for persistence) is using those valid credentials to access the system and install the malware. This makes **T1078 - Valid Accounts** the most plausible technique to occur after obtaining the credentials, as it directly involves using those credentials for further malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
   - With these credentials, they would use valid accounts to access systems or perform actions that require administrative privileges, such as installing backdoors.
   - Therefore, the technique that likely occurred after obtaining domain administrator credentials is using those valid accounts for further access.

Final Answer: B
