To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after BlueDelta exploited Roundcube vulnerabilities to perform discovery activities on system and network information but before the attackers secured sensitive victim credentials, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - The attackers, BlueDelta, have already exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube. This exploitation allowed them to perform discovery activities on system and network information. This step implies they have gained some level of access to the system.
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after this initial exploitation and discovery but before they secured sensitive credentials like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action is the exploitation of Roundcube vulnerabilities, which is not directly an ATT&CK technique but leads to discovery activities. This could involve techniques like `T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery` or others related to reconnaissance and discovery.
   - The next step in the sequence we are trying to identify is what happens after this discovery but before credential securing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This involves obtaining credentials from the operating system. It's more likely to occur after the attackers have gained sufficient access to perform such actions, potentially after they've done some reconnaissance or discovery.
   - **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique is about gathering information about the system and network configurations. Given that the attackers have already performed discovery activities, this might not be the immediate next step unless it's more focused or detailed discovery.
   - **C: T1547.014-Active Setup**: This technique involves using Active Setup to execute code during user logon. While it's a method for persistence or privilege escalation, it doesn't directly fit the sequence of exploiting vulnerabilities, performing discovery, and then securing credentials.
   - **D: T1187-Forced Authentication**: This technique involves forcing a user's authentication process to gain access to a system or network. It could potentially occur after initial discovery but might not directly lead to securing sensitive credentials like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already performed initial discovery activities, likely using techniques such as `T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery`.
   - The next logical step before securing sensitive credentials would be to further establish their presence or prepare for credential acquisition. `T1003-OS Credential Dumping` directly involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the goal of securing sensitive credentials but might be too advanced without additional access or privileges.
   - Considering the sequence, the attackers need to have a reason to believe they can access or need the credentials, which suggests some form of discovery or reconnaissance has already occurred.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the attackers have performed discovery and are looking to secure sensitive credentials, the most plausible next step that aligns with the ATT&CK framework and the described sequence would be to look for a technique that either directly precedes credential dumping or is a natural progression from discovery to credential acquisition.

**Final Answer: B**
