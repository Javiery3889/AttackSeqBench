To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes the activities of UNC1151, a threat actor, before they gained initial access to their targets. It mentions that they were trying to understand details about victim webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during these efforts.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key detail here is that UNC1151 was gathering information about potential targets before launching spear phishing campaigns. This implies a reconnaissance phase where they are collecting information that could be used to tailor their phishing attacks or to understand the layout and vulnerabilities of their targets.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1591.004-Identify Roles**: This technique involves identifying the roles and responsibilities of individuals within a target organization. While this could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it's more specific to understanding the organizational structure rather than gathering general information about webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is the technique used for initial access in the question, not the reconnaissance or information-gathering phase before the phishing campaign.
   - **C: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves gathering information about email accounts, which could be relevant. However, the question seems to be asking about a broader scope of information gathering than just email accounts.
   - **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the target's network, which could include details about webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses. It's a broader category that encompasses gathering information necessary for planning and executing targeted attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the pre-phishing phase where UNC1151 is gathering information.
   - The information gathering is about understanding details of potential targets, which includes but is not limited to email accounts.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique should reflect a broad information-gathering effort related to the targets' networks and infrastructure.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the need for a technique that aligns with broad information gathering about targets before a phishing campaign, **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** seems the most appropriate. This technique aligns with the efforts to understand the targets' environments, which would include webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses, in preparation for targeted attacks.

Final Answer: D
