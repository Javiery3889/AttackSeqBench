To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before WinDealer exfiltrated processed and encrypted ".a" files, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the exfiltration of files over a C2 (Command and Control) channel, specifically from the %TEMP% directory to a C2 server. This action is related to the technique of exfiltrating data, which is a key aspect of the attack sequence.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique mentioned in the question is exfiltration, which aligns with T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. However, we are looking for a technique that likely occurred before this exfiltration.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which could be related to setting up a C2 channel but doesn't directly precede the act of exfiltration in a necessary sequence.
   - **B: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the domain trusts of the target environment. While it could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it doesn't directly lead to the exfiltration of files.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This is the technique mentioned in the question itself and not a precursor to the action described.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: Similar to T1041, this involves exfiltrating data but using alternative protocols, which is not a precursor but rather an alternative method of the same action described.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence involves setting up or preparing for the exfiltration. However, none of the provided choices directly precede exfiltration in a necessary sequence except for considering the broader context of how an attacker might prepare for such an action.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Exfiltration (as described) is the end goal.
2. For exfiltration to occur, especially over a C2 channel, the attacker needs to have established a means of communication.
3. Establishing a C2 channel might involve using non-standard ports to avoid detection, which makes **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port** a plausible precursor in the broader context of setting up the infrastructure needed for exfiltration.

**Final Answer**: A
