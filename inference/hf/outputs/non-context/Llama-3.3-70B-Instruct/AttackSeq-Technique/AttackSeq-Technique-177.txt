To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Infamous Chisel achieved persistence by replacing the legitimate netd system binary, let's analyze the scenario and the provided answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The threat actor, Infamous Chisel, replaced the legitimate netd system binary at /system/bin/netd with a malicious version. This replacement allowed them to leverage init to execute the malicious binary with root privileges, thus achieving persistence on the compromised system. This action implies that the attacker had already gained sufficient access and privileges to modify system files and configure the system to execute their malicious binary.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary scanning for open ports and services on the target system or network to identify potential targets. While this could be an early step in an attack, it doesn't directly relate to achieving persistence by modifying system binaries.
   - **B: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks to execute at a specified time. However, the scenario describes leveraging init to execute the malicious binary, not scheduling a task.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system and perform various actions. Modifying system binaries and leveraging system services like init to execute them could involve using native APIs to achieve the desired level of access and control.
   - **D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding malicious infrastructure, which doesn't directly relate to the action of replacing system binaries to achieve persistence.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The action of replacing a system binary and configuring the system to execute it with root privileges suggests a level of access and control that likely required prior reconnaissance and exploitation.
   - The most relevant technique to this action would involve interacting with the system at a low level, potentially using native system calls or APIs to modify system files and configure system services.
   - Among the provided choices, **T1106-Native API** is the most closely related to the kind of system-level interaction required to replace a system binary and ensure it is executed by init with root privileges.

**Final Answer: C**
