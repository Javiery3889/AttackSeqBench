To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Charming Kitten sent socially engineered email messages, let's analyze the given options in the context of the attack sequence described:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that Charming Kitten sent socially engineered email messages to gain initial access. This implies the group was attempting to trick victims into performing certain actions (like clicking on links or opening attachments) that would compromise their systems.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique used here for initial access is social engineering via email, which aligns with the ATT&CK technique T1566 - Phishing. However, we need to find a technique that likely occurred before this phishing attempt.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**: This technique involves wiping or destroying data on a disk. It doesn't seem directly related to the preparation or execution of a phishing campaign aimed at initial access.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This involves compromising a system by exploiting vulnerabilities when a user visits a malicious website. While it's a method for initial access, it doesn't directly precede or facilitate a phishing campaign via email.
   - **C: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: Compromising infrastructure could involve gaining control over systems or services that could be used to support further malicious activities, such as sending phishing emails from seemingly legitimate sources.
   - **D: T1584.006-Web Services**: This involves compromising web services, which could be used to host phishing sites or to send emails that appear to come from legitimate sources, but it's more specific to web services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The goal of the attackers is to send socially engineered emails that appear legitimate.
   - To increase the success rate of such emails, it would be beneficial for the attackers to compromise infrastructure (like email servers or services of known researchers/journalists) that the targets trust.
   - Compromising such infrastructure (Option C) would allow the attackers to send emails that appear to come from trusted sources, making the phishing attempt more believable and increasing its chances of success.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the goal of making the phishing emails appear as legitimate as possible, compromising infrastructure that can be used to send these emails or make them appear more authentic would be a logical step before the phishing attempt.

Final Answer: C
