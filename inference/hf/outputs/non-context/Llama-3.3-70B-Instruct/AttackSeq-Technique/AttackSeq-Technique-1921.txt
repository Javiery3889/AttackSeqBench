To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT10, a known advanced persistent threat group. The actions include using systems sharing access and credentials for lateral movement across the network and then staging data for exfiltration in multi-part archives, compressing them in locations like the Recycle Bin. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the lateral movement but before or as part of the data staging and exfiltration process.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned or implied in the question are:
   - Lateral movement using shared access and credentials.
   - Staging data for exfiltration in multi-part archives.
   - Compressing data in locations like the Recycle Bin.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1021.003 - Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)**: This technique involves using DCOM for lateral movement. While it's a method for moving laterally, the question already mentions lateral movement has occurred, so this might not be the immediate next step unless it's part of a broader lateral movement strategy.
   - **T1602.001 - SNMP (MIB Dump)**: This involves using Simple Network Management Protocol to gather information. It doesn't directly relate to the actions of staging data for exfiltration or compressing it.
   - **T1560 - Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving data, often for exfiltration. Given that the question mentions staging data in multi-part archives and compressing it, this technique aligns closely with the described actions.
   - **T1566 - Phishing**: This is an initial access technique and does not align with the actions described after lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - APT10 has already performed lateral movement, indicating they have access to the network and are looking to exfiltrate data.
   - The next logical step after gaining access to desired data would be to prepare it for exfiltration, which involves collecting, archiving, and possibly compressing the data.
   - Among the given options, **T1560 - Archive Collected Data** directly relates to the preparation of data for exfiltration, fitting the sequence of actions described.

**Final Answer: C**
