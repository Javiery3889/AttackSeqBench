To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already achieved persistence using HKCU autorun system registry keys Run and RunOnce. This implies the attacker has a foothold in the system and is looking to maintain communication with their Command and Control (C2) infrastructure. The question specifically asks about transmitting encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - Achieving persistence (already done through autorun registry keys).
   - Maintaining communication with C2 infrastructure.
   - The method of communication involves HTTP POST requests with encrypted and compressed JSON data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim organization, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining C2 communication.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application-layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for C2 communication. Given that the question mentions HTTP POST requests for transmitting data to the C2 infrastructure, this seems highly relevant.
   - **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using non-application layer protocols (like ICMP, DNS, etc.) for C2 communication, which doesn't match the HTTP POST method described.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is about achieving persistence, which is already mentioned as achieved in the question, and doesn't relate to the method of C2 communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique used to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.
   - The communication method specified is HTTP POST requests with encrypted and compressed JSON data.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique that aligns with using HTTP for C2 communication.

5. **Final Answer**: 
Given the information and the process of elimination, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for transmitting encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure is related to using application-layer protocols.

Final Answer: B
