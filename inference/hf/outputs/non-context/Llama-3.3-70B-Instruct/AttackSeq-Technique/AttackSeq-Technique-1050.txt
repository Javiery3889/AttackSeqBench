To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the Darkhotel APT maintained persistence using autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group, known as Darkhotel, has already deployed various malware components on victims' systems. The deployment methods mentioned include malicious software updates and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) sharing sites. After the deployment, the APT group maintained persistence using autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The sequence of events is as follows:
   - Initial infection through malicious software updates or P2P sharing sites.
   - Deployment of various malware components.
   - Maintenance of persistence using autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon. While it's related to persistence, the question asks for the technique that occurred before maintaining persistence.
   - **B & C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute malicious code. Given that the malware was deployed through malicious software updates and P2P sharing sites, exploiting a client vulnerability could be a plausible initial infection vector.
   - **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores. While credential theft is a common goal of many attacks, it doesn't directly relate to the initial deployment of malware through software updates or P2P sites.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial infection vector mentioned involves malicious software updates and P2P sharing sites, which suggests that the attackers exploited vulnerabilities in client applications or used social engineering to trick users into executing the malware.
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution** aligns with the scenario of exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications (such as those used for software updates or P2P file sharing) to execute malicious code initially.
   - The other options either relate to persistence (A) or obtaining credentials (D), which, while potentially part of the attack chain, do not directly precede the deployment of malware components as described.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the information and analysis, the most plausible technique that occurred before maintaining persistence is the exploitation of client applications to execute malicious code, which aligns with the initial infection vector described.

Final Answer: B
