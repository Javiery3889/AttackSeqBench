To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, identified as Volatile Cedar, has conducted vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers. Following this, but before using the Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components, the attacker needs to spread further into the target network. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely allowed this spread.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with vulnerability scans (not explicitly listed as an ATT&CK technique in the choices but implies reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation), followed by an unspecified technique for network spread, and ends with the use of the Explosive Trojan for remote execution.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access or execute code. Given that the attacker has already identified exploitable web servers, this could be a plausible next step to gain access to the network.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. Since the attacker has identified exploitable web servers, this could also be a plausible step, as web servers often host public-facing applications.
   - **C: T1480.001-Environmental Keying**: This sub-technique involves using environmental features to encode data. It doesn't directly relate to spreading within a network or exploiting services/applications for initial access.
   - **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading malware through removable media, which doesn't align with the scenario described, as there's no mention of physical media being used for the spread within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already conducted vulnerability scans, indicating they are looking for weaknesses to exploit.
   - The goal is to spread further into the target network before using the Explosive Trojan, suggesting they need to establish a foothold or gain access to more systems.
   - Exploiting remote services (T1210) or public-facing applications (T1190) could both achieve this, but given the context of web servers being targeted, exploiting a public-facing application seems more directly related to the initial step of identifying vulnerable web servers.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the need to spread within the network after identifying vulnerable web servers and before using the Explosive Trojan, the most plausible technique for Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network would be exploiting public-facing applications, as it directly relates to the exploitation of web servers for network access.

Final Answer: B
