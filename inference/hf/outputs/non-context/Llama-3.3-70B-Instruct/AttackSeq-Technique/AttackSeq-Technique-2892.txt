To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the establishment of persistence through a secondary macro in 'Circular.xls', an Excel document. This implies that the attack involves a malicious Excel document that uses macros to execute malicious code. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred earlier in the attack sequence.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the use of an Excel document with macros to establish persistence. This suggests a sequence where the victim is tricked into opening the malicious Excel document, which then executes malicious code via macros.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the use of macros in an Excel document for establishing persistence.
   - **B: T1222-File and Directory Permissions Modification**: This technique involves modifying file or directory permissions, which could be a step after establishing access to a system but doesn't directly explain how the malicious Excel document was executed.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking a user into performing a certain action, such as opening a malicious document. Given that the attack sequence involves an Excel document with macros, phishing is a likely initial step to get the victim to open the document.
   - **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. While it could be part of an advanced attack, it doesn't directly relate to the initial steps of getting a malicious document opened and executed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack involves a malicious Excel document with macros, indicating the need for user interaction to open the document.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a common technique used to trick users into opening malicious documents, making it a plausible initial step.
   - The other options, while potentially part of a broader attack sequence, do not directly lead to the execution of macros within an Excel document as described.

**Final Answer: C**
