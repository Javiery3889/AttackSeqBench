To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after executing arbitrary code on the infected host, KONNI achieved persistence through a Windows shortcut named "adobe distillist.lnk". This implies that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is looking to maintain persistence.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique that occurred before achieving persistence is what we're trying to identify. Persistence in this context is achieved through a Windows shortcut, which is related to autostart execution techniques.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1070.008 - Clear Mailbox Data**: This technique involves clearing mailbox data, which doesn't directly relate to achieving persistence through a Windows shortcut.
   - **B: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing processes automatically at boot or logon, which aligns with using a Windows shortcut for persistence, as shortcuts can be used to execute malicious programs at startup or logon.
   - **C: T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which, while potentially useful for an attacker, doesn't directly relate to the method of achieving persistence described.
   - **D: T1098.004 - SSH Authorized Keys**: This technique involves adding SSH authorized keys to a system, allowing for password-less login. While related to persistence, it doesn't directly relate to using a Windows shortcut for achieving persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies that persistence was achieved through a Windows shortcut, which suggests that the attacker wanted to ensure the malware starts automatically.
   - Among the given options, **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the technique that most directly relates to achieving persistence by automatically starting a program (in this case, through a Windows shortcut) at boot or logon.
   - The other options, while potentially part of an attack sequence, do not directly precede the use of a Windows shortcut for persistence in the way that autostart execution does.

**Final Answer: B**
