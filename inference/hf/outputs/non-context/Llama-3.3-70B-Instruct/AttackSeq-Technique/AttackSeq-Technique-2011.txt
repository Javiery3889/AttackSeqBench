To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before BlackEnergy 3 malware was executed on workstations, let's analyze the scenario step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The scenario involves the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware on workstations. This execution is a result of employees enabling macros in weaponized phishing email attachments. This implies a social engineering attack where the initial vector is a phishing email that tricks users into enabling macros, which then leads to the execution of the malware.

2. **Identifying Key Elements**:
   - **Initial Vector**: Phishing email with malicious attachments.
   - **User Action**: Enabling macros.
   - **Result**: Execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware.

3. **Analyzing ATT&CK Techniques**:
   - **T1569.001 - Launchctl**: This involves using launchctl to execute a command or program. While it could be related to persistence or execution, it doesn't directly relate to the initial exploitation or the action of enabling macros in a phishing email attachment.
   - **T1129 - Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules to evade detection. It doesn't directly relate to the initial exploitation vector of phishing emails and enabling macros.
   - **T1018 - Remote System Discovery**: This technique is about discovering remote systems. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of malware through phishing emails and macro enablement.
   - **T1204 - User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code by tricking a user into doing something (like enabling macros in a document). This directly aligns with the scenario described, where users enable macros in phishing email attachments, leading to the execution of malware.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the scenario where the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware is a direct result of users enabling macros in phishing email attachments, the most relevant ATT&CK technique that occurred before the malware execution is **T1204 - User Execution**. This technique directly involves the user in the execution of malicious code, which matches the described scenario.
