To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The sequence starts with the RIG Exploit kit distributing CEIDPageLock. This implies an initial exploitation phase where a vulnerability is exploited to gain access to the victim's system.
   - The exploitation results in tampering with the victim's browser homepage, indicating a level of control over the victim's system or application.
   - Before the dropper starts the kernel-mode driver for persistence, we are looking for a technique that likely occurs after the initial exploitation and before establishing persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial exploitation can be associated with drive-by compromise (T1189), which involves exploiting a vulnerability in a user's browser or browser plugins, leading to malware infection.
   - The question asks for the technique that occurs after this exploitation but before the establishment of persistence through a kernel-mode driver.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise** (A and B) refers to the initial exploitation phase, which has already occurred according to the question.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** refers to the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication. This could potentially occur after the initial exploitation as the malware establishes communication back to its command and control servers.
   - **T1219-Remote Access Software** doesn't directly fit the sequence as it involves the use of remote access software, which might not be directly related to the exploitation and pre-persistence phase described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The exploitation has occurred, leading to the distribution of CEIDPageLock and tampering with the browser homepage.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, before establishing persistence, would involve the malware communicating with its C2 servers or preparing the environment for further malicious activities.
   - Given the choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** seems the most plausible as it involves communication protocols that could be used post-exploitation for C2 communication or for the malware to receive further instructions before the dropper installs a kernel-mode driver for persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
