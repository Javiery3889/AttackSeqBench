To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred when SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of SparrowDoor for reading file contents as part of data collection and the subsequent exfiltration of data over a Command and Control (C&C) channel. The key detail here is the communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves data collection using SparrowDoor and then communicating with a C&C server for data exfiltration. The question specifically asks about the technique used when SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to evade detection or to gain access to the process's memory and permissions. While process injection could be a part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly relate to the communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.
   - **B: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This sub-technique is about determining the physical location of a device. It doesn't directly relate to the communication between malware and a C&C server for data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is a common technique used by malware to securely communicate with C&C servers, protecting the data in transit from interception and eavesdropping. Given that SparrowDoor is communicating with a C&C server, using an encrypted channel would be a logical step to secure this communication.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol to bypass network restrictions. While it could be used for C&C communication, the question's context doesn't specifically suggest bypassing network restrictions as the primary goal of the communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.
   - The primary goal of this communication is data exfiltration.
   - Securing this communication to prevent detection and ensure the integrity of the exfiltrated data is crucial.
   - Among the provided options, establishing an encrypted channel directly addresses the need to secure the communication between the malware and the C&C server.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of the question and the need to secure communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server for data exfiltration, the most plausible technique is establishing an encrypted channel.

Final Answer: C
