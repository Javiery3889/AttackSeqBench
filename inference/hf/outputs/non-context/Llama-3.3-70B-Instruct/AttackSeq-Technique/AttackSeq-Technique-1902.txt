To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before TeamTNT's script used iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the execution of a coin miner saved as /usr/sbin/docker-update and the subsequent use of iplogger.org by TeamTNT's script to track infected hosts. This implies a sequence of events where the attacker has already gained access to the host, executed malware (the coin miner), and is now in the phase of monitoring or exploiting the infected hosts.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) mentioned here involves the execution of a coin miner and the use of a script to track infected hosts. The use of iplogger.org suggests that the attackers are interested in monitoring and possibly controlling the infected hosts, which implies they have already established some level of access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1542.004 - ROMMONkit**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the ROMMON (ROM Monitor) of network devices to gain persistence. While it's a method for persistence, it doesn't directly relate to the tracking of infected hosts or the execution of a coin miner as described.
   - **B: T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering the network connections of a system, which could be relevant for understanding the environment and potentially identifying paths for lateral movement or exfiltration. However, it's more about network reconnaissance than directly related to the execution of malware or tracking infected hosts.
   - **C: T1595 - Active Scanning**: Active scanning involves the adversary actively scanning the network to gather information, which could include identifying potential targets or understanding the network layout. This could be relevant for identifying hosts to infect but doesn't directly precede the tracking of infected hosts.
   - **D: T1087 - Account Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to gather information about accounts on a system or within an environment. While account discovery is crucial for many types of attacks, it's less directly related to the scenario described, which focuses on the execution of a coin miner and tracking infected hosts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario describes the execution of a coin miner, indicating the attackers have already gained access to the host.
   - The use of iplogger.org for tracking suggests the attackers are in a phase of monitoring or exploiting the infected hosts.
   - Given the context, the most relevant technique that would occur before tracking infected hosts would involve understanding the network or system to some extent, to ensure the coin miner's execution and the tracking mechanism's effectiveness.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering the need for the attackers to understand the system or network before executing the coin miner and tracking the infected hosts, **T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery** seems the most plausible technique that would occur before the described actions. This technique would help in understanding the network layout, potentially identifying targets, and ensuring the coin miner and tracking script can operate effectively.

**Final Answer: B**
