To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have already used Cobalt Strike Beacon for credential dumping and have cleared log files. This indicates they are in the phase of exploiting the network, likely aiming to move laterally. The specific action mentioned is executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP mentioned here involves executing processes on remote computers. This action is characteristic of lateral movement, where an attacker attempts to spread their control across a network after gaining initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to disrupt the availability or integrity of the data. While encryption might be used in various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to executing processes on remote computers for propagation.
   - **B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content to include malicious components. It doesn't directly align with the action of executing processes on remote computers.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to execute commands on a remote system. This can be a method for lateral movement, where an attacker uses legitimate remote access tools or services to move laterally within a network.
   - **D: T1583.004-Server**: This sub-technique is related to using a server for persistence, which doesn't directly match the action of executing processes on remote computers for the purpose of network propagation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already gained access and are looking to move laterally.
   - The action of executing processes on remote computers is a key indicator of lateral movement.
   - Among the given options, **T1021-Remote Services** is the technique that most closely aligns with the action of executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

**Final Answer: C**
