To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Lazarus gained access to other devices within the FEIB network, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Access and Lateral Movement**: Lazarus gained access to the network and then moved laterally within it using hardcoded credentials. This indicates they have already established a foothold and are expanding their control.

2. **Establishing Connections to SMB Shares**: By connecting to SMB (Server Message Block) shares, Lazarus is likely aiming to access shared files, exploit vulnerabilities, or use the connection for further lateral movement.

Given these actions, the next logical step would involve utilizing the established access for deeper penetration or to set up a more stable presence within the network.

**Evaluating the Options**:

- **A: T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools within a compromised network, which could be a logical next step after gaining access and establishing connections. It allows the attackers to move their tools closer to their target or to use them from a more advantageous position within the network.

- **B: T1563 - Remote Service Session Hijacking**: While this could be a method to gain access to additional systems, it seems more related to taking control of existing remote sessions rather than a direct follow-up to accessing SMB shares and using hardcoded credentials.

- **C: T1202 - Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands on a remote system through an intermediary. It's possible but seems less directly related to the immediate actions of accessing SMB shares and moving laterally.

- **D: T1556.001 - Domain Controller Authentication**: This involves obtaining authentication to a domain controller, which could be a goal but seems more like an objective rather than a direct consequence of accessing SMB shares and using hardcoded credentials for lateral movement.

**Conclusion**: Given the context of lateral movement and accessing SMB shares, the most plausible next step would be to transfer tools within the network to further the attack. This makes **A: T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer** the most likely technique to occur after the described actions, as it directly supports further exploitation and control of the compromised network.

Final Answer: A
