To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Hidden Cobra gained initial access to the Turkish financial organizations, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that Hidden Cobra used spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document to gain initial access. This indicates the initial access vector was through phishing, specifically spear phishing, which is a targeted form of phishing.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique used for initial access is phishing, which aligns with T1566-Phishing. However, we are looking for the technique that most likely occurred before this initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities that can be used in future operations. While it's plausible that an adversary would develop capabilities before using them, this is more related to the preparation phase of an attack rather than an immediate precursor to initial access.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services to gain access or conduct operations. While external remote services could be used in the reconnaissance phase or for establishing command and control, it doesn't directly precede the use of phishing as an initial access vector.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system. While system information discovery could occur after initial access, it's less likely to be the immediate precursor to phishing, as phishing often relies on social engineering rather than detailed system information.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique used for initial access according to the question. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before this, making this choice not applicable as it is the method of initial access itself.

Given the context, **T1587-Develop Capabilities** (A) seems the most plausible as a precursor in the broader context of an adversary's operations. Before executing an attack like the one described, an adversary would likely need to develop or acquire the necessary capabilities, including the malicious Microsoft Word document and the infrastructure to support the phishing campaign. This development would logically precede the execution of the phishing campaign aimed at gaining initial access.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access technique: Phishing (T1566).
2. Consider what typically precedes phishing in an attack sequence.
3. Evaluate each option in the context of preceding phishing.
4. Choose the option that best fits as a precursor to the initial access technique.

**Final Answer**: A
