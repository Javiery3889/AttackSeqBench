To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions "DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe" and the goal of ensuring T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot. DLL sideloading is a technique where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL. The mention of "igfxtray.exe" suggests the exploitation of a legitimate process to load malicious code.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial technique used is DLL sideloading, which aligns with the concept of executing malicious code under the guise of a legitimate process. The question then asks about ensuring persistence and execution of T9000's components across reboots and with every user mode process.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments, which doesn't directly relate to achieving persistence across system reboots or ensuring execution with every user mode process.
   - **B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This involves renaming system utilities to evade detection, which doesn't directly address the goal of ensuring components run with every user mode process after a reboot.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon, which aligns with the goal of ensuring T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot.
   - **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: While this technique could be used for persistence, it's more about creating or modifying system processes, which is not as directly related to ensuring execution at boot or logon time as option C.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already used DLL sideloading to execute malicious code.
   - The goal now is to ensure persistence and execution of T9000's components across system reboots and with every user mode process.
   - Among the given options, **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the technique that most directly addresses this goal by ensuring that malicious code is executed automatically at system boot or user logon, thereby achieving persistence and widespread execution across user mode processes.

**Final Answer: C**
