To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving Tropic Trooper's backdoor, which after decrypting its configuration file, connects using the SSL protocol to a C&C (Command and Control) server. The key elements here are the decryption of a configuration file, the use of SSL for connection, and the involvement of a backdoor.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Decryption of a configuration file (implying some form of encryption or obfuscation was used).
   - Connection to a C&C server using SSL protocol.
   - The use of custom SSL libraries for secure connection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**: This technique involves using a service to send spearphishing emails. While initial compromise could be through spearphishing, the question focuses on post-compromise activities (connection to C&C server), making this less directly relevant.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to hide C2 (Command and Control) communications. Given the context of using SSL for connection, this seems highly relevant as it directly pertains to establishing an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server.
   - **C: T1001.002-Steganography**: This involves hiding data within another file or message. While steganography could be used to hide malicious data, the question specifically mentions decryption of a configuration file and the use of SSL, not necessarily hiding data within other files or messages.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using tools to deploy software. While software deployment tools could be used in the broader context of an attack, the specific focus on connecting to a C&C server via SSL doesnâ€™t directly align with this technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question emphasizes the use of SSL for connecting to the C&C server, indicating an effort to establish a secure, encrypted communication channel.
   - The most relevant technique to this action, based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, would be one that directly involves creating or using an encrypted channel for C2 communications.
   - Given the choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the technique that most directly aligns with the action of leveraging custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: B**
