To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario involving the Shamoon malware, which is known for its destructive capabilities, particularly in overwriting disk boot records as part of its defense evasion strategy.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves an initial action of overwriting disk boot records, which is a method used by the malware to evade detection and defenses.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely executes next to achieve the destruction of target data on disks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves actions taken by an adversary to impair or disable security defenses, which could include overwriting boot records. However, the question asks for the technique that follows such an action, specifically for data destruction.
   - **B: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique directly involves the deletion or destruction of data, which aligns with the goal of achieving the destruction of target data on disks after evading defenses.
   - **C: T1496.002-Bandwidth Hijacking**: This technique is related to hijacking network bandwidth, which does not directly relate to the destruction of data on disks.
   - **D: T1484-Domain Policy Modification**: This technique involves modifying domain policies, which is more related to gaining privileges or persistence rather than directly destroying data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The Shamoon malware's action of overwriting disk boot records is a defense evasion tactic.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, given the context of the malware's known destructive behavior, would be to destroy data on the disks.
   - Among the provided options, **T1485-Data Destruction** is the technique that directly aligns with the goal of destroying target data on disks.
   - Therefore, after evading defenses by overwriting boot records, the most likely next step in the attack sequence for achieving data destruction would be **T1485-Data Destruction**.

Final Answer: B
