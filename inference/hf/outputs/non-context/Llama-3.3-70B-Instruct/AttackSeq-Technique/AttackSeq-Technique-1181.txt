To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor establishes communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server. This communication involves the use of XML messages for collecting system and geolocation information from the infected machine. The key detail here is the establishment of "secure and encrypted communication" for data transmission.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Establishing secure and encrypted communication.
   - Using XML messages for communication.
   - Collecting system and geolocation information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1001.001 - Junk Data**: This technique involves sending irrelevant data to make analysis more difficult. It does not directly relate to establishing secure and encrypted communication.
   - **B: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect C2 (Command and Control) communications. This directly aligns with the need for "secure and encrypted communication" mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information**: While obfuscation can be a part of hiding malicious activities, it doesn't directly enable secure and encrypted communication for data transmission.
   - **D: T1556.005 - Reversible Encryption**: This technique involves using encryption that can be reversed or decrypted. While it does involve encryption, the question emphasizes the establishment of secure and encrypted communication, which is more broadly covered by creating an encrypted channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the need for secure and encrypted communication.
   - Establishing an encrypted channel (T1573) is a technique that directly supports this requirement by ensuring that communications between the backdoor and the C&C server are encrypted.
   - The other options, while related to evasion or encryption, do not directly address the establishment of secure communication channels as effectively as T1573 does.

**Final Answer: B**
