To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after using social engineering and spear phishing for credential access, Rocket Kitten employed suspicious string obfuscation and made API calls harder to detect. The techniques mentioned are part of the initial access and execution phases, where an attacker gains access to a system and then executes their malicious code.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - **Initial Access**: Social engineering and spear phishing are used for credential access. This suggests the attacker has gained access to the system.
   - **Execution**: The attacker then employs suspicious string obfuscation, which is a technique to evade detection, and makes API calls harder to detect. This indicates the attacker is trying to hide their malicious activities.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1622-Debugger Evasion**: This technique involves evading debuggers, which could be part of the attacker's efforts to remain undetected but doesn't directly relate to the sequence of using social engineering, then obfuscating strings and hiding API calls.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This involves capturing input data, which might not directly precede the actions of obfuscating strings and hiding API calls as a necessary step in the sequence described.
   - **C: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique is related to gaining access to a system by poisoning name resolution protocols, which could be a step after initial credential access to move laterally within a network but doesn't directly relate to the actions of string obfuscation and hiding API calls.
   - **D: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**: This technique involves clearing logs to evade detection, which aligns with the goal of making API calls harder to detect and could logically follow the initial access and execution phases as the attacker tries to cover their tracks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker gains initial access through social engineering and spear phishing.
   - The attacker then executes their malicious code, which includes obfuscating strings to evade detection.
   - To further evade detection and cover their tracks, the attacker would likely try to remove evidence of their activities, such as clearing event logs.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the sequence of events and the goal of evading detection, the most plausible technique that occurred before Rocket Kitten employed suspicious string obfuscation and made API calls harder to detect is related to covering tracks and evading detection.

Final Answer: D
