To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) for lateral movement, which is a technique used by attackers to move through a network after gaining initial access.
   - It asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gather information on network configuration, supporting FIN13's operational objectives after this lateral movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial technique mentioned is the use of WMI for lateral movement, which aligns with techniques like T1021 (Remote Services) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically using WMI for remote execution.
   - The question then asks about gathering information on network configuration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves discovering internet connections, which might not directly relate to gathering detailed network configuration information.
   - **B: T1505-Server Software Component**: This involves gathering information about server software components, which could be part of network reconnaissance but is more focused on software than overall network configuration.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique directly involves gathering information about the network configuration, which would be crucial for understanding the network layout, identifying potential targets, and supporting further operational objectives.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique is about identifying default accounts, which, while useful for lateral movement and privilege escalation, does not directly relate to gathering network configuration information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already performed lateral movement using WMI, indicating they are inside the network and looking to expand their control or gather more information.
   - To effectively support operational objectives like those of FIN13 (a financially motivated group), understanding the network configuration is crucial. This includes knowing the network topology, identifying key servers, and understanding how data flows.
   - Among the given options, **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** is the most directly related to gathering this type of information.

**Final Answer: C**
