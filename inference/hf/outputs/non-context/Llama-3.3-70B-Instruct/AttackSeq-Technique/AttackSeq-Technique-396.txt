To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Linux Turla sample intercepted incoming packets without root access and executed commands via '/bin/sh -c', let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The Linux Turla sample is described as intercepting incoming packets without root access and executing commands via '/bin/sh -c'. This implies the malware is capable of capturing network traffic and executing system commands, potentially for the purpose of establishing persistence, gathering information, or further compromising the system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial action involves network packet interception and command execution. The next logical step in an attack sequence after gaining the ability to execute commands could involve establishing persistence, hiding tracks, or escalating privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**: This technique involves modifying the PATH environment variable to intercept commands. While it's a method for persistence and privilege escalation, it doesn't directly follow from executing commands via '/bin/sh -c' as a necessary next step.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This involves removing indicators of compromise. After executing commands, an attacker might try to cover their tracks, but this doesn't directly leverage the capability to execute commands via '/bin/sh -c'.
   - **C: T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves using cron jobs for persistence. Scheduling tasks could be a next step after gaining command execution capability, but it's more about persistence than directly leveraging the '/bin/sh -c' execution for immediate post-exploitation activities.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter (like '/bin/sh -c') to execute commands. Given that the Linux Turla sample already executes commands via '/bin/sh -c', this choice seems to align closely with the described action, as it directly involves using command and scripting interpreters for execution, which could be a continuous process after initial command execution for further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial action is executing commands via '/bin/sh -c', which is a form of using a command and scripting interpreter.
   - The next logical step in an attack sequence after gaining command execution capability could involve further leveraging this capability for various post-exploitation activities.
   - Among the given choices, **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** directly relates to the action of executing commands, making it a plausible next step in the sequence.

**Final Answer: D**
