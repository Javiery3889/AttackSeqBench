To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Aurora malware:
   - The malware modifies the file-time of a dropped DLL.
   - It deletes itself for Defense Evasion.
   - It loads the DLL into the svchost.exe process.
   - Before establishing communication with the Command and Control (C&C) servers over port 443, we need to identify the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The actions described involve modifying file attributes (which could be part of evading detection), loading a DLL into a legitimate process (which could indicate a form of execution or persistence), and communicating with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. The provided sequence does not directly indicate exploitation of a public-facing application; it focuses on post-exploitation activities.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automatically collecting data from a system. While data collection might be a goal of the malware, the described sequence focuses on evasion and establishing a presence rather than data collection.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators that could be used to detect the adversary. Modifying file-times and deleting the malware itself can be considered part of indicator removal, which aligns with Defense Evasion tactics.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process. Loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process like svchost.exe could be seen as a form of hijacking execution flow, but the question asks for the technique that occurred after loading the DLL and before C&C communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already loaded the DLL into svchost.exe, which suggests it has established a method for execution or persistence.
   - The next logical step before communicating with C&C servers would involve ensuring the malware's presence remains undetected or preparing the system for further malicious activity.
   - Given the choices, **T1070-Indicator Removal** seems to be the most relevant technique after modifying file-times and loading the DLL, as it aligns with the malware's effort to evade detection before proceeding with other malicious activities like communicating with C&C servers.

**Final Answer: C**
