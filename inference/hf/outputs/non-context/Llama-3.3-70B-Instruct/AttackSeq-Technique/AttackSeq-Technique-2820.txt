To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Derusbi malware gathered host and system information and before the malware's communication traffic to the C2 using obfuscated HTTP POST requests, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Derusbi malware has already gathered host and system information. This action can be associated with techniques like T1082 (System Information Discovery) or T1018 (Remote System Discovery), but these are not the focus. The question is about what happens after this information gathering and before the malware communicates with its Command and Control (C2) server using obfuscated HTTP POST requests.

2. **Understanding the Techniques**:
   - **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the use of modules shared across different instances of malware. While it could be relevant in a broader campaign, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of gathering information and then communicating with a C2 server.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique is about establishing an additional, covert channel for command and control in case the primary channel is discovered or blocked. It's more about redundancy in C2 communication rather than the preparation for or the act of communicating with a C2 server.
   - **T1036-Masquerading**: This involves disguising the malware or its communications to appear as something benign. While masquerading could be a part of the communication process, the specific mention of "obfuscated HTTP POST requests" suggests a focus on hiding the content or nature of the communication rather than masquerading as a different type of traffic or system process.
   - **T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique is about making data unreadable or hiding it from detection, which aligns closely with the use of "obfuscated HTTP POST requests" for C2 communication. Data obfuscation would logically occur after the malware has gathered information it wants to exfiltrate or communicate back to the C2 server and before it sends this information, to protect the data from being intercepted and understood.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has gathered host and system information.
   - Before communicating this information back to the C2 server, it would logically take steps to protect this communication from detection.
   - The use of obfuscated HTTP POST requests indicates an attempt to hide the content of the communication.
   - Therefore, the most likely technique to occur after information gathering and before C2 communication using obfuscated HTTP POST requests is data obfuscation.

**Final Answer: D**
