To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where customer credit card data is obtained during the interception at store checkout pages. This data is then sent to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the stolen data was sent to the collection server.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements in the sequence are:
   - Interception of customer credit card data at store checkout pages.
   - The data is sent to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to prevent detection. If the attackers are sending stolen data to a collection server, they might encode the data to evade detection by security systems.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious content into a website. While it could be related to how the interception occurred, it doesn't directly relate to the action of sending data to a collection server.
   - **C: T1037.003-Network Logon Script**: This technique involves using logon scripts to execute malicious code. It doesn't directly relate to the sending of stolen data to a collection server.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information. While phishing could be a method to obtain credit card data, the question specifies the data was obtained during interception at store checkout pages, not through phishing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the action taken after the data is intercepted, specifically how it is handled before being sent to a collection server.
   - Encoding the data (T1132.001) would be a logical step to avoid detection while transmitting the stolen data.
   - The other options either relate to different stages of the attack (like initial compromise or execution of malicious code) or do not directly relate to the handling of stolen data during transmission.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that occurred before the stolen data was sent to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server is encoding the data to prevent detection during transmission.

Final Answer: A
