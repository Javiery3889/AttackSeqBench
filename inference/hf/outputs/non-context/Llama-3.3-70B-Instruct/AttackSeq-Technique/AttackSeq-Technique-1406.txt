To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers gain initial access through phishing, specifically targeting Instagram credentials.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) starts with phishing to gain initial access, aiming to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1537-Transfer Data to Cloud Account (A)**: This technique involves transferring stolen data to a cloud account under the attacker's control. While it could be part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the collection of credentials.
   - **T1531-Account Access Removal (B)**: This technique is about removing account access to hide malicious activity, which doesn't directly align with the goal of collecting credentials.
   - **T1566-Phishing (C)**: This technique directly involves tricking victims into revealing sensitive information such as passwords and usernames, which matches the initial access method described.
   - **T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools (D)**: This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools, which doesn't align with the described phishing campaign aimed at collecting social media credentials.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that the attackers used phishing messages mimicking Instagram's interface to gain initial access and collect credentials.
   - Phishing (T1566) is the technique that directly corresponds with the initial step of the attack sequence described, as it involves deceiving victims into divulging sensitive information like usernames and passwords.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred during the campaign, given the context of collecting Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials through phishing, is T1566-Phishing.

Final Answer: C
