To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Lazarus group performed network share, process, and system network configuration discovery, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The Lazarus group has already performed discovery activities to identify potential new targets for lateral movement. They used WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) and compromised router virtual machines for this purpose. The discovery activities mentioned include:
   - Network share discovery
   - Process discovery
   - System network configuration discovery

   These activities are typically associated with the initial stages of an attack, where the attackers are trying to understand the network layout, identify potential vulnerabilities, and plan for lateral movement.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary trying to identify the owners or users of a system. While it could be a part of the discovery process, it seems more specific to identifying user accounts rather than the broader network and system discovery already mentioned.
   - **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves the adversary archiving the data they have collected. This would typically occur after the data collection phase, which seems to be what the initial discovery activities are a part of. However, archiving collected data doesn't directly follow the discovery for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves scanning for open network services or ports to understand what services are running on a system or network. Given that the group has already performed network share, process, and system network configuration discovery, discovering network services could be a logical next step to further understand the network and identify potential vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - **D: T1608-Stage Capabilities**: This technique involves the adversary setting up capabilities that can be used during the operation, such as setting up command and control (C2) channels or staging data. While this could be a part of the attack process, it doesn't directly follow the discovery activities aimed at identifying targets for lateral movement.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial activities (network share, process, and system network configuration discovery) are aimed at understanding the network and identifying potential targets.
   - The next logical step after identifying potential targets would be to gather more specific information about those targets to plan the lateral movement effectively.
   - Among the given options, **T1046-Network Service Discovery** directly aligns with the goal of gathering more detailed information about the network services running on the potential targets, which can help in planning the lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C**
