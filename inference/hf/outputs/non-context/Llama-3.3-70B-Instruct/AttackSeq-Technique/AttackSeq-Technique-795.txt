To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the wiper module employed RawDisk to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system under the Impact tactic, let's analyze the given information and options:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question mentions a wiper module using RawDisk to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files. This action is associated with the Impact tactic, which involves disrupting or destroying systems and data. The use of RawDisk for such destructive purposes suggests a highly privileged level of access to the system.

2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to make it difficult to detect or reverse-engineer. While data encoding can be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the action of overwriting system components like the MBR or files.
   - **B: T1561-Disk Wipe**: This technique is about wiping disks, which aligns closely with the action described in the questionâ€”overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files. However, the question asks for a technique that occurred **before** the disk wipe action.
   - **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This is a technique used for network manipulation, allowing an attacker to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network. This could potentially be used to gain access to a system but doesn't directly precede a disk wipe action in a logical attack sequence.
   - **D: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood**: This technique involves overwhelming a service with requests to degrade or disable it. While it could be part of an attack to gain access or control, it doesn't directly lead to the use of a wiper module for overwriting system components.

3. **Evaluating the Logical Sequence**: The question seeks a technique that logically precedes the destructive action of overwriting system components. Given the options, none directly precede the action in a straightforward manner based on typical attack sequences. However, considering the need for an attacker to gain sufficient access or control to execute such a destructive action, techniques that facilitate access or system control are more relevant.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the options and the context, **B: T1561-Disk Wipe** seems to be the closest related technique to the action described (using RawDisk to overwrite system components), but it's actually the technique being described in the question, not a precursor. Among the provided options, there isn't a perfect fit for a technique that directly precedes disk wiping in a typical attack sequence. However, if we must choose based on the premise of the question, we should consider what would enable such an action. Since none of the options perfectly fit as a precursor in a standard attack sequence, and given the nature of the question, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in how the question is framed regarding the options provided.

However, following the instructions to select the most plausible based on the information given and the typical flow of an attack, **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning** could potentially be used in the early stages of an attack to gain network access, which could eventually lead to the point where an attacker could execute a wiper module. But, this is a bit of a stretch given the direct context of the question.

**Final Answer: C**
