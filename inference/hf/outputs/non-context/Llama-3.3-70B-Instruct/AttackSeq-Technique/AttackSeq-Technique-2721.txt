To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the Lazarus group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents, let's analyze the given options in the context of the attack sequence.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question specifies that the initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents. This is a method of gaining initial access, which is typically categorized under "Initial Access" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique used here for initial access is spear-phishing, which aligns with **T1566-Phishing**. However, we are looking for a technique that likely occurred before this initial access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves spreading to other systems through removable media, which doesn't fit as a precursor to gaining initial access via spear-phishing.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique used for initial access, not before.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network and system configurations, which could be a post-exploitation activity rather than a pre-initial access activity.
   - **D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This is a sub-technique of phishing that involves voice phishing, which could potentially be used before or in conjunction with email-based phishing to gather information or prepare the target.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for a technique that occurred **before** the initial access via spear-phishing emails.
   - Techniques like **T1091** and **T1016** don't logically precede initial access in the context provided.
   - **T1566-Phishing** is the method of initial access itself, not a precursor.
   - **T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice** could potentially be used to gather preliminary information or to set the stage for the email phishing campaign by making the target more susceptible to the email phishing attempt.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the need for a technique that likely occurred before the initial access, **T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice** seems less directly related to the preparation for email-based spear-phishing compared to the other options provided, which either are the method of initial access itself or post-access techniques. However, upon closer consideration, the question's framing suggests looking for a technique that precedes the described spear-phishing email campaign. Since none of the provided options perfectly fit the typical pre-initial access reconnaissance or preparation phase in a straightforward manner based on their descriptions, and considering the aim is to identify a technique that likely occurred before the described initial access method, we must evaluate which could plausibly precede or complement the initial access technique described.

Given the nature of the question and the typical flow of an attack, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in directly applying these techniques to the "before" scenario without considering the broader context of reconnaissance and preparation that typically precedes initial access attempts like spear-phishing. However, based on the provided options and the logic that we're looking for something that could plausibly occur before or in preparation for the initial access attempt described:

**Final Answer: D**
