To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the initial access via a spear-phishing campaign and before achieving persistence by dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder, let's analyze the scenario step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The Lazarus Group used a spear-phishing campaign with macro-embedded documents masquerading as job opportunities. This method is typically used to gain initial access to a system, often through user interaction (e.g., opening a malicious document).

2. **Technique Sequence**: After gaining initial access, an attacker would likely want to understand the environment they are operating in. This involves discovering the system's processes, users, and potentially vulnerable software or configurations.

3. **Persistence**: The goal of dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder is to achieve persistence. This means the attackers want to ensure their malware remains on the system even after it is restarted.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into another process by exploiting the way Windows handles memory. While it's a method that could be used post-initial access, it's more related to code injection and evasion rather than a direct precursor to achieving persistence through startup folder modification.

- **B: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft**: This involves stealing or impersonating tokens to gain access to resources. It's a technique that could be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement but isn't directly related to the sequence of gaining initial access and then achieving persistence through a startup folder.

- **C: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the running processes on a system. After initial access, discovering processes can help attackers understand the system's layout, identify potential security software, and plan their next steps, such as where to inject code or how to maintain persistence. This technique aligns well with the need to understand the environment before taking actions like dropping a malicious file into the startup folder for persistence.

- **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This involves intercepting and altering or redirecting the flow of API calls, system calls, etc. While it's a technique that could be used for persistence or evasion, it's not as directly related to the sequence of initial access and then achieving persistence through modifying the startup folder as process discovery is.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attackers gain initial access through spear-phishing.
2. They need to understand the system environment to decide on the next steps.
3. Process discovery (T1057) fits well as a technique used after initial access to gather information about the system's processes.
4. Achieving persistence by dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder follows the process discovery, as understanding the system helps in deciding how to persist.

**Final Answer: C**
