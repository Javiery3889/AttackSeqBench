To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of malicious payloads and the use of '.lnk' files for initial access by Mustang Panda. This implies a method where malicious files are used to gain access to a system. The '.lnk' files, which are shortcut files in Windows, can be used to execute commands or open malicious files, thus serving as a vector for initial access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves initial access and the execution of malicious payloads. The use of '.lnk' files suggests a technique that involves tricking users into executing these files, possibly through social engineering or by exploiting the trust in these file types.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. Phishing can be used to distribute malicious files, including '.lnk' files, as attachments or downloads, which aligns with the scenario described.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising as a legitimate entity to gain access. While masquerading can be part of the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the use of '.lnk' files for initial access.
   - **C: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations**: This technique is related to modifying cloud service configurations, which does not directly relate to the use of '.lnk' files for gaining initial access to a system.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique involves using default accounts to gain access. It does not directly relate to the deployment of malicious payloads via '.lnk' files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies the use of '.lnk' files for initial access, which suggests a method that relies on user interaction or exploitation of trust in file types.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a common technique used to distribute malicious files, including '.lnk' files, by tricking users into opening or executing them.
   - The other options do not directly relate to the distribution or execution of malicious files via '.lnk' files for initial access.

**Final Answer: A**
