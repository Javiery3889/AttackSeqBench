To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of internal C&C (Command and Control) proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes to external C&C servers on the internet. This action is followed by the utilization of stealthy communication under the Command and Control tactic by GreyEnergy operators. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this stealthy communication.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique of using internal C&C proxies to redirect requests is closely related to the Command and Control tactic. The question hints at the use of proxies (which aligns with technique T1090-Proxy) for redirecting communication, which is a method to maintain stealthy communication. However, we are looking for a technique that occurred before the utilization of stealthy communication.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to redirect traffic, which is mentioned in the question itself as part of the attack sequence. It's about using internal C&C proxies, which is directly related to the Command and Control tactic but doesn't necessarily precede the stealthy communication in a logical sequence of events.
   - **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: Data obfuscation could be a method used for stealthy communication but doesn't directly relate to the action of using internal C&C proxies to redirect requests as a preceding step.
   - **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: Gathering victim identity information could be an initial step in an attack sequence, often necessary before establishing command and control, as it helps in tailoring the attack and understanding the victim's environment.
   - **D: T1070.002-Clear Linux or Mac System Logs**: Clearing system logs is typically an action taken to evade detection after an attack has been initiated, not necessarily before establishing stealthy communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for a technique that occurred before the utilization of stealthy communication under the Command and Control tactic.
   - The use of internal C&C proxies (related to T1090-Proxy) is part of the stealthy communication method itself.
   - Gathering victim identity information (T1589) could logically precede the establishment of command and control, as it provides necessary information for the attackers to plan their next steps, including how to communicate stealthily with the compromised systems.
   - Data obfuscation (T1001) and clearing system logs (T1070.002) are techniques that could be used during or after the establishment of command and control for evasion and persistence but don't necessarily precede the stealthy communication setup.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the logical sequence of attack steps, the most plausible technique that occurred before the utilization of stealthy communication under the Command and Control tactic is gathering information about the victim, which would help in planning the attack, including setting up stealthy communication channels.

Final Answer: C
