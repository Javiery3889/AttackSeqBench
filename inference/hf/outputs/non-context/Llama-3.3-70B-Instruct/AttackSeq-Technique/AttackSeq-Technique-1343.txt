To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack attributed to ShadowPad, where the attackers execute a backdoor using DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred for the attackers to gain access to the victim's network before executing the backdoor.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the use of ShadowPad, DLL hijacking, and the exploitation of a legitimate application. The question implies an initial access technique is needed to set up the subsequent exploitation.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with the compromised system. While encryption might be used during the attack, it doesn't directly relate to gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This involves using voice phishing to trick victims into divulging sensitive information or performing certain actions. It's a plausible initial access technique but doesn't directly relate to exploiting applications or systems.
   - **C: T1187-Forced Authentication**: This technique involves forcing a user's authentication to a system, which doesn't directly fit the scenario of exploiting an application to gain access.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to a network. Given the context of exploiting a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application (which could be considered public-facing or at least accessible from outside the network), this seems like a plausible initial access technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers need an initial access point to the victim's network.
   - Exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) is a common method for gaining this initial access.
   - The subsequent use of DLL hijacking and ShadowPad suggests a sophisticated attack that likely started with exploiting a vulnerability in an accessible application.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the information and the need for an initial access technique that aligns with the exploitation of an application, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: D**
