To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, Shuckworm, has already gained initial access and is using malicious documents to execute a backdoor (Pterodo) and has scheduled tasks to maintain their foothold. The question specifically asks which ATT&CK technique would most likely ensure the backdoor remains active across system reboots.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the execution of a backdoor and the scheduling of tasks to support maintaining access. The question implies a need for persistence, which is a critical aspect of maintaining access to a compromised system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically when a system boots up or a user logs on. It directly addresses the need for persistence across system reboots by ensuring that the backdoor is re-executed after the system restarts.
   - **B: T1098-Account Manipulation**: This technique involves creating or modifying accounts to maintain access. While it contributes to persistence, it doesn't directly ensure that a backdoor remains active across reboots unless used in conjunction with other persistence techniques.
   - **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**: This involves using malicious images to hide malicious code. It's more related to evasion and execution rather than ensuring persistence across reboots.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute malicious commands. It's a method of execution but doesn't inherently provide persistence across system reboots.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically asks about maintaining the backdoor's activity across system reboots, which points towards a persistence technique.
   - Among the given options, **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** directly addresses the requirement for persistence by ensuring that the malicious backdoor is executed upon system boot or user logon, thus maintaining access.
   - Other options, while potentially part of the attack sequence, do not directly ensure the backdoor remains active after a system reboot.

**Final Answer: A**
