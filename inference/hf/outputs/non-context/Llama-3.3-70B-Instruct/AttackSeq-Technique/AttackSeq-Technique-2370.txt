To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the use of PowerShell commands with multilayered base64 encoded code to install Poison Ivy, a type of remote access trojan (RAT).
   - It then asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the malware established communication with the C2 (Command and Control) server at 'web.outlooksysm.net'.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The installation of Poison Ivy using PowerShell with encoded code suggests a technique related to execution or defense evasion.
   - The communication with a C2 server indicates the malware has been successfully installed and is now attempting to establish a connection for further instructions or data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1592.002-Software**: This refers to a sub-technique under "Active Scanning" which doesn't directly relate to the installation of malware or establishing C2 communications.
   - **B: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls**: This is a technique related to "Process Discovery" and involves using system calls to gather information about running processes, which doesn't directly fit the context of installing malware and establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection, which could include hiding the malware itself or its communications. Given that the malware is using encoded PowerShell commands, this could be a plausible step before establishing C2 communication to avoid detection.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into performing certain actions or divulging sensitive information. While phishing could be an initial vector for malware delivery, the question focuses on the sequence after the malware (Poison Ivy) has been installed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question implies that the malware (Poison Ivy) has already been installed on the system using PowerShell with encoded commands.
   - The next logical step before the malware can establish communication with its C2 server would be to ensure it can operate undetected.
   - Hiding artifacts (T1564) would be a critical step for the malware to avoid detection by security software or system administrators, allowing it to establish and maintain communication with the C2 server without interruption.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the context of the question and the techniques provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that hiding artifacts would be a necessary step before the malware establishes communication with the C2 server to avoid detection and ensure the persistence of the malware.

Final Answer: C
