To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the InfoOS module gathered system information and the RemoteShell module listed installed applications and iPhone backups for Discovery, let's break down the steps and analyze the options provided.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already gathered system information using an InfoOS module and has listed installed applications and iPhone backups using a RemoteShell module. These actions are part of the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gathering information about the target system or network.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned (gathering system information and listing installed applications and backups) are related to Discovery (TA0007). The next logical step after Discovery would be to use the gathered information for further exploitation or to maintain access.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the attacker's IP address. While it could be used at various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly follow from the Discovery activities described.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system. Given that the attacker has already listed installed applications, discovering running processes is a plausible next step to understand the system's current state and potential vulnerabilities.
   - **C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which might not directly follow the system and application discovery steps described.
   - **D: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This involves capturing and analyzing network traffic, which could be a next step but doesn't directly build on the specific actions of gathering system information and listing applications and backups.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already performed initial discovery.
   - The next logical step would be to gather more detailed information about the system's current state.
   - Process Discovery (T1057) fits well as a next step after identifying installed applications and system information because it provides real-time data on running processes, which can be crucial for planning the next stages of the attack, such as identifying potential vulnerabilities or processes to hijack.

**Final Answer: B**
