To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after TeamTNT compromised the exposed Weave Scope service, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: TeamTNT gained initial access through an exposed Weave Scope service. This suggests they exploited a vulnerability or misconfiguration to get into the system.

2. **Goal**: The ultimate goal was the deployment and execution of a coin miner payload. This implies that after gaining access, the attackers needed to execute their payload to start mining cryptocurrency.

3. **Technique Analysis**:
   - **A: T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code in an environment that does not require server management, such as cloud functions. While possible, this doesn't directly relate to the immediate post-exploitation activities typically seen after gaining access through a compromised service.
   
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. After gaining initial access, using a command and scripting interpreter (like Bash, PowerShell, etc.) would be a logical next step to execute further malicious scripts or commands, including deploying and executing a coin miner payload.
   
   - **C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This sub-technique involves obtaining sensitive information by accessing process memory. While useful for post-exploitation reconnaissance, it doesn't directly lead to the deployment of a coin miner.
   
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning**: Active scanning involves scanning the network to gather information about the environment. This could be part of post-exploitation reconnaissance but doesn't directly relate to deploying and executing a payload like a coin miner.

Given the goal of deploying and executing a coin miner payload after gaining initial access, the most plausible next step would involve executing commands or scripts to set up and run the miner. This makes **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** the most likely technique used after the initial compromise, as it directly facilitates the execution of malicious code or scripts necessary for deploying the payload.

Final Answer: B
