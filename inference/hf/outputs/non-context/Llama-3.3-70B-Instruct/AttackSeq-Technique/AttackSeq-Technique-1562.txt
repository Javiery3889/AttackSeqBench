To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gained initial access through a supply chain attack on BigNox's update mechanism during Operation NightScout.
   - The sequence of events includes gaining initial access and then extracting C&C (Command and Control) information to a file on the victim's system.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to evade detection between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - Initial access was gained through a supply chain attack (T1195-Supply Chain Compromise).
   - The question implies that after gaining access, the attackers needed to evade detection before they could extract C&C information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves the adversary checking the system for certain conditions, which might not directly relate to evading detection after initial access.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding or disguising artifacts to evade detection, which aligns with the need to remain undetected after gaining initial access and before extracting sensitive information.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This is the method used for initial access and does not describe actions taken after access is gained.
   - **D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This involves using voice communications for spearphishing, which does not fit the context of evading detection after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used to evade detection after gaining initial access and before extracting C&C information.
   - Given the context, the most plausible action to evade detection would involve hiding or disguising the attacker's artifacts or presence on the system.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts** directly addresses the need to evade detection by hiding artifacts, making it the most likely technique used in this scenario.

Final Answer: B
