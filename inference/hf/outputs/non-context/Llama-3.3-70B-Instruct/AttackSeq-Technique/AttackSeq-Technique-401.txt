To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions enabling Macro content to execute a payload. This typically involves a user opening a malicious document (e.g., a Word document) that contains macros, which then execute malicious code. This action is often associated with the initial access tactic, specifically through phishing or spearphishing attachment (T1566).
   - The execution of the payload through `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32` suggests the use of command and scripting interpreters (T1059) to execute commands or run malicious scripts.
   - The malware then initiates SSL communication with a command and control (C2) server using an expired digital certificate. This indicates an attempt to establish a secure communication channel with the C2 server, potentially for exfiltrating data or receiving further commands. This action aligns with the command and control (C2) tactic, specifically using application layer protocols (T1071) for communication.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for C2 communication. Given that the malware initiates SSL communication (a form of secure application layer protocol) with a C2 server, this technique seems directly relevant to the described action.
   - **B: T1542.003-Bootkit**: A bootkit is a type of malware that infects the boot sectors of a hard drive, allowing it to load before the operating system. This does not directly relate to the execution of macros, use of `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`, or the establishment of C2 communication.
   - **C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This involves obtaining credentials from files. While credential access is a common goal of malware, the question does not specifically mention the malware attempting to obtain credentials from files before establishing C2 communication.
   - **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. While evasion techniques are common, the question does not provide information suggesting the malware is attempting to evade virtualization or sandbox detection before establishing C2 communication.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where malware is executed through macros, utilizes command and scripting interpreters, and then establishes secure communication with a C2 server.
   - The most relevant technique to the action of initiating SSL communication with a C2 server would be related to command and control.
   - Among the provided options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most directly related to the described action of establishing C2 communication, even though the question specifies the use of an expired digital certificate, which might imply additional evasion or obfuscation techniques.

Final Answer: A
