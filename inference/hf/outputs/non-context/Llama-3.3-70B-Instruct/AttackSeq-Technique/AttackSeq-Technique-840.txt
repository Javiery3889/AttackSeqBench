To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the WinDealer malware has been executed, and it has read a configuration file and loaded a DLL module. After these actions, the malware discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this discovery.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key actions mentioned are the execution of malware, configuration file reading, loading a DLL module, and then the discovery of system and network information. The techniques provided as options are:
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This involves using an external proxy to hide the identity of the attacker.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments, which could be relevant if the malware is trying to avoid being detected in a controlled environment.
   - **T1036-Masquerading**: This involves disguising the malware or its communications to appear as something benign.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary trying to gather information about the software running on the system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy** does not directly relate to the discovery of system and network information.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** could potentially happen at any point if the malware is designed to evade detection, but it doesn't directly relate to the discovery of system information.
   - **T1036-Masquerading** might be relevant if the malware is disguising itself, but again, it doesn't directly precede the discovery of system and network information.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery** directly involves gathering information about the software on the system, which could include discovering information about the infected PC and its network configuration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already been executed and configured, indicating it has reached the system.
   - The next logical step for the malware, before it can effectively operate or exfiltrate data, would be to understand its environment.
   - Discovering software (T1518) would be a precursor to understanding the system and network configuration because knowing what software is installed can reveal potential vulnerabilities and configuration details.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context that the malware needs to understand its environment before it can proceed with further malicious activities, the most logical technique that would occur before discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration is related to gathering information about the system.

Final Answer: D
