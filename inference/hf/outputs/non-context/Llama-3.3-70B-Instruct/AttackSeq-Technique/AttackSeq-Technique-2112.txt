To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gather screenshots as part of the attackers' surveillance objectives before exfiltrating data. This implies we are looking for a technique related to collecting visual data from the victim's system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The question mentions gathering screenshots, which is a specific tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP) used by attackers for surveillance. The technique we are looking for should directly relate to capturing or recording screen content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**: This technique involves shutting down or rebooting a system, which does not directly relate to gathering screenshots for surveillance.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique is related to network exploitation and gaining access to systems, not directly related to screen capture.
   - **C: T1555.002-Securityd Memory**: This involves accessing sensitive information from securityd memory, which might include credentials or other sensitive data but is not specifically about screen capture.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique directly involves capturing screenshots or recording screen activity, aligning with the objective of gathering visual data for surveillance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks for the technique used to gather screenshots.
   - Among the given options, only one directly relates to the action of capturing screen content.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the described attack sequence is the one that involves screen capture.

Final Answer: D
