To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by an adversary that includes copying results from a discovery phase. This phase involves gathering information such as file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes. After this, the adversary uses a custom-built tool to exfiltrate data to cloud storage web services.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key actions mentioned are:
   - Discovery phase (involving gathering information about the target system).
   - Copying results from this phase.
   - Exfiltrating data using a custom tool to cloud storage.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1114-Email Collection (A)**: This technique involves collecting email from a mailbox or email server. While it could be part of the discovery phase, it's more specific to email and doesn't directly relate to the broader action of copying results from a discovery phase that includes various types of data.
   - **T1080-Taint Shared Content (B)**: This technique is about modifying shared content to compromise systems that access it. It doesn't directly fit the sequence of copying discovery results and then exfiltrating data.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive (C)**: This technique involves collecting data from a network shared drive. Given that the discovery phase includes gathering information about remote system shares, this technique aligns closely with the action of copying results from the discovery phase, which would include data from network shared drives.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services (D)**: This technique is about exploiting a service that is available on a remote system. While exploitation could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly follow the action of copying discovery results in the context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after copying results from the discovery phase.
   - The discovery phase includes gathering information about file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes.
   - The technique should logically follow the discovery phase and precede the exfiltration of data.
   - **T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive** fits well as it involves collecting data that could have been identified during the discovery phase, such as data from remote system shares.

**Final Answer: C**
