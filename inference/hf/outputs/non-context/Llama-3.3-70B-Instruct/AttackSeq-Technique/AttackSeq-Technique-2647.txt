To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has established command and control (C2) using FTP and HTTP, encrypted data with AES for transmission, and then exfiltrated data by copying it to removable drives when a specific file was present. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the exfiltration method described, which involves copying data to removable drives.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned or implied in the question include:
   - Establishing command and control (C2) using FTP and HTTP.
   - Encrypting data with AES for transmission.
   - Exfiltrating data by copying it to removable drives when a specific file is present.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 channel that is encrypted with asymmetric encryption. While encryption is mentioned, the specific method of exfiltration (over non-C2 protocol) and the type of encryption (asymmetric) don't directly align with the scenario described, which focuses on exfiltration to removable drives.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration method described (copying data to removable drives) or the preceding actions (C2 establishment and data encryption).
   - **C: T1056.001-Keylogging**: Keylogging involves capturing keystrokes, which could potentially be used to gather information before exfiltrating data. However, it doesn't directly relate to the preparation or method of exfiltration described.
   - **D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**: This technique directly involves exfiltrating data using a physical medium, such as removable drives. However, the question asks for a technique that occurred **before** the exfiltration method described (copying data to removable drives), not the exfiltration method itself.

Given the context, the question seems to be looking for an action that precedes the physical exfiltration of data (copying to removable drives) and is logically connected to the scenario described. Since the exfiltration method itself (D) is what's described at the end, we need to consider what would likely happen before this step in the context of the ATT&CK framework and the details given.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario describes establishing C2 and encrypting data, which suggests the attacker is preparing for or is in the process of exfiltrating sensitive information.
   - The act of exfiltrating data to removable drives when a specific file is present implies a conditional or targeted exfiltration effort.
   - Considering the options provided and the context of preparing for exfiltration, **none of the options directly describe an action that necessarily precedes the exfiltration to removable drives in a logical sequence based on the question's details**. However, we must choose the most plausible based on typical attack sequences.
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging** could potentially provide information on what data is available or how to access it, which might precede the decision on what data to exfiltrate. However, this is somewhat speculative without more direct context linking keylogging to the exfiltration method.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture** could also be used to gather information before deciding what to exfiltrate but, like keylogging, it's not directly implied as a precursor to the specific exfiltration method described.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the need to select the most plausible technique that occurred before the described exfiltration and considering typical attack sequences, **none of the provided options perfectly fit as a direct precursor** to exfiltrating data by copying it to removable drives based on the information given. However, if we must choose based on the information provided and the typical flow of an attack, **T1056.001-Keylogging** might be considered as it could potentially be used to gather information that aids in the exfiltration process, although it's a bit of a stretch without more context.

**Final Answer: C**
