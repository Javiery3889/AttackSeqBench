To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the exfiltration of collected email accounts through a POST web request and asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the communication of a PowerShell script with domains to download malware and send collected data. The key elements here are the use of a PowerShell script, communication with external domains, and the actions of downloading malware and sending collected data.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves initial data collection (email accounts), exfiltration, and then further communication to download malware and possibly send back the collected data. This implies a need for command and control (C2) communication.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to direct command and control traffic. While it could be part of the infrastructure used for C2 communication, it doesn't directly relate to the use of PowerShell for downloading malware and sending data.
   - **B: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute scripts during PowerShell initialization. It's more about persistence and initial access rather than the ongoing communication for downloading malware and sending collected data.
   - **C: T1114-Email Collection**: This technique is about collecting email, which is mentioned but is not the focus of the question regarding the communication mechanism used by the PowerShell script.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communication. Given that the question mentions exfiltration through a POST web request and the need for the PowerShell script to communicate with domains, this technique aligns well with the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the communication method used by a PowerShell script to interact with external domains for downloading malware and sending collected data.
   - The use of a POST web request for exfiltration suggests the use of web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication.
   - Among the given options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the technique that directly relates to using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS for command and control communication, which fits the scenario of a PowerShell script communicating with domains.

Final Answer: D
