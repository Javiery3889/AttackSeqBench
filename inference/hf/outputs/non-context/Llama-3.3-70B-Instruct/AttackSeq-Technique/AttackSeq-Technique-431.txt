To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a Delphi downloader has executed, gathered system information, and sent it to a Command and Control (C&C) server. It asks which MITRE ATT&CK technique is most likely used to secure communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Execution of the Delphi downloader.
   - Gathering system information.
   - Sending the information to the C&C server.
   - The need to secure communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for security vulnerabilities or open ports. It doesn't directly relate to securing communication.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect communication between the adversary and the compromised system, which aligns with securing C&C communication.
   - **C: T1071.004-DNS**: This sub-technique involves using DNS for communication, which could be used for C&C but doesn't inherently secure the communication.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process, which doesn't directly relate to securing communication between a backdoor and a C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about securing communication, which implies protecting the data exchanged between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server from interception or eavesdropping.
   - Among the given options, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the technique that directly addresses securing communication by encrypting the channel used for C&C communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for securing communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server involves using an encrypted channel.

Final Answer: B
