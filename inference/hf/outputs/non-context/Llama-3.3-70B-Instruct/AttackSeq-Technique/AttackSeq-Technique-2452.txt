To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Elise malware is involved. After employing defense evasion techniques and establishing communication with a hardcoded Command and Control (C2) server, the malware proceeds to harvest extensive system information. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs during this phase of harvesting system information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key actions here are the employment of defense evasion techniques, communication with a C2 server, and the harvesting of extensive system information. The ATT&CK framework provides a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by adversaries. The techniques mentioned in the answer choices are:
   - **T1083: File and Directory Discovery**: Involves the adversary searching for files and directories of interest within a network or system.
   - **T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery**: Involves the adversary attempting to gather information about the network configuration, including but not limited to: IP addresses, domains, network segments, and topology.
   - **T1564.009: Resource Forking**: This is not a standard technique in the ATT&CK framework as of my last update. However, "Resource Hijacking" or similar concepts might refer to the adversary taking control of system resources, but this does not directly relate to harvesting system information in the context provided.
   - **T1071: Application Layer Protocol**: Involves the use of application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server, but it does not directly relate to the action of harvesting system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1083 (File and Directory Discovery)** is relevant when the adversary is looking for specific files or directories, which could be part of harvesting system information but is more focused on file system exploration.
   - **T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery)** directly involves gathering system and network configuration information, which aligns with the action of harvesting extensive system information.
   - **T1564.009 (Resource Forking)**, as mentioned, does not directly apply to the scenario described.
   - **T1071 (Application Layer Protocol)** is more about the method of communication rather than the action of harvesting system information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the harvesting of extensive system information after the malware communicates with a C2 server.
   - The most relevant technique to this action is **T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery**, as it directly involves gathering information about the system and network, which is a key part of harvesting system information.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurs as the malware harvests extensive system information is **T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery**.

Final Answer: B
