To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence involving FIN7, where after deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery, an ATT&CK technique occurred before data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client during the Collection stage. The key elements here are:
   - Deployment of Cobalt Strike: This is a tool often used for network reconnaissance, lateral movement, and establishing a foothold within a network.
   - Network reconnaissance and data discovery: This implies the attackers are trying to understand the network layout and identify potential targets or data of interest.
   - Data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client: This is the final step mentioned, indicating the attackers are moving data out of the network.

2. **Identifying Relevant TTPs**: 
   - **T1497.001 - System Checks**: This involves the adversary checking the system for various properties, which could be part of reconnaissance but is more about understanding the system's configuration and capabilities.
   - **T1018 - Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering systems on the network that can be accessed remotely, which aligns with network reconnaissance.
   - **T1563.001 - SSH Hijacking**: This involves taking control of an existing SSH session, which could be part of lateral movement but doesn't directly relate to the initial reconnaissance and data discovery phase.
   - **T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands, which could be part of many phases of an attack but is more about execution and less about discovery.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - Given that Cobalt Strike is used for network reconnaissance and data discovery, the next logical step would involve understanding the network layout and identifying potential targets. 
   - **T1018 - Remote System Discovery** directly aligns with this objective as it involves discovering remote systems that can be accessed, which is a crucial part of network reconnaissance and would precede data exfiltration efforts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers deploy Cobalt Strike, indicating an interest in network reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - The next step should logically involve discovering accessible systems on the network to identify where data might reside or where further access can be gained.
   - **T1018 - Remote System Discovery** fits this requirement perfectly as it is about discovering remote systems, which would be essential before attempting to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: B**
