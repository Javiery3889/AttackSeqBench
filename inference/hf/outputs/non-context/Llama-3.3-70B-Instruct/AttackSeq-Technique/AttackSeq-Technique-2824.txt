To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where a Remote Control System (RCS) spyware is delivered via spearphishing emails disguised as a PDF document.
   - It mentions the use of VMProtect to make the spyware samples resistant to detection.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involves delivering malware and then taking steps to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial TTP involves delivering malware through spearphishing (which aligns with B: T1566-Phishing, but this is not what the question is asking about directly).
   - The key part of the question focuses on making the spyware resistant to detection using VMProtect.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making data or files hard to detect by obscuring its contents. Using VMProtect to make spyware samples resistant to detection fits this description because VMProtect is a software protection and obfuscation tool that can make it difficult for security software to detect the spyware.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is the method used to deliver the malware but does not relate to making the malware resistant to detection.
   - **C: T1578-Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure**: This technique is unrelated to the scenario described, as it involves modifying cloud infrastructure, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1600.002-Disable Crypto Hardware**: This technique involves disabling hardware-based cryptographic mechanisms, which is not relevant to the use of VMProtect for obfuscation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically asks about the technique used to make the spyware resistant to detection after it has been delivered.
   - The use of VMProtect to obfuscate the spyware aligns with the technique of making files or information hard to detect.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique in this context is obfuscating files or information to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
