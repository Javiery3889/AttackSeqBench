To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that after identifying folders related to antivirus and banking software during the Discovery stage, we need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to gather user activity data on banking sites. The Discovery stage involves gathering information about the target environment, which can include identifying security software and potential targets like banking software.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically when a user logs on or when the system boots. While it could be used to establish persistence and potentially gather data, it's not directly related to gathering user activity data on banking sites.
   - **B: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging**: This involves staging data in a remote location, which might be part of exfiltrating data but doesn't directly relate to gathering user activity on specific sites like banking.
   - **C: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**: This technique is about blocking indicators that might be used to detect the adversary's activities. It doesn't directly involve gathering user activity data.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which could be used to gather user activity data, especially on sensitive sites like banking platforms. It directly aligns with the goal of gathering user activity data on banking sites.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the need to gather user activity data on banking sites after identifying relevant software during the Discovery stage.
   - The most direct method to achieve this among the given options is through **screen capture**, as it allows the adversary to visually capture and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information such as login credentials, account numbers, etc.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred to gather this specific type of data is **T1113-Screen Capture**.

Final Answer: D
