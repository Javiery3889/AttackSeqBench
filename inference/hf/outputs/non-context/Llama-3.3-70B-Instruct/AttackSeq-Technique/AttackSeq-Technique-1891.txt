To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after gathering information on network and host configurations, and before employing WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells for lateral movement, FIN13 (a sophisticated threat actor group) targets user accounts within victim networks. The key here is understanding what technique would facilitate targeting user accounts as part of the attack sequence.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Gathering information on network and host configurations.
   - Targeting user accounts (the technique we are trying to identify).
   - Employing WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the trust relationships between domains in an Active Directory forest. While useful for understanding the network layout, it's more about domain relationships than directly targeting user accounts.
   - **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**: This involves using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to intercept authentication requests. It could be relevant for credential theft or manipulation but is more specific to authentication mechanisms rather than the initial targeting of user accounts.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves collecting data from shared network drives. While it could provide information on users, it's more about data collection than specifically targeting user accounts for lateral movement or further exploitation.
   - **D: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique is about discovering local and domain accounts. It directly aligns with the goal of targeting user accounts within victim networks, as it would provide the necessary information for further exploitation, such as using WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack sequence starts with gathering network and host information, indicating a reconnaissance phase.
   - The next step involves targeting user accounts, which is crucial for lateral movement and further exploitation.
   - Among the given options, **T1087-Account Discovery** is the most relevant technique for identifying and targeting user accounts, as it directly supports the goal of understanding what accounts are available for potential exploitation.
   - This technique would logically precede the use of WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement, as knowing which accounts exist and their potential privileges is essential for planning and executing lateral movement effectively.

**Final Answer: D**
