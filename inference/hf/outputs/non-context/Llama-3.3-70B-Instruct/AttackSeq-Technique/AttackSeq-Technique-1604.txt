To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze each step in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The attacker uses a shortcut in the Windows startup folder pointing to a VBE (Visual Basic Editor) startup script. This indicates the use of a technique for maintaining access to the compromised system, which is not directly relevant to the communication method but shows the attacker's intent to remain in the system.

2. **Evading Defenses**: By detecting traces of virtualization or malware analysis tools, the attacker is employing anti-analysis techniques, which are common in evasive malware. This step is about avoiding detection rather than communication.

3. **Communication with the C&C Server**: The question specifies that the communication involves JSON-encoded objects and leverages public services as dead drop resolvers. This is key to identifying the correct ATT&CK technique.

Given these details, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the screen of the compromised system, which does not directly relate to the method of communication with a C&C server using JSON-encoded objects and public services as dead drop resolvers.

- **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**: This sub-technique under "Dynamic Resolution" involves using DNS to calculate or resolve domain names for C&C communication. While it's related to dynamic resolution, the specific mention of JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers might not be the best fit for this sub-technique alone.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C&C communication. While web services can be used for communication, the specific details about JSON-encoded objects and dead drop resolvers suggest a more nuanced approach that might not be fully encapsulated by this technique alone.

- **D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses for C&C communication. The use of public services as dead drop resolvers, where data is hidden in publicly accessible locations (like social media, blogs, etc.) and resolved dynamically, aligns well with this technique. The mention of JSON-encoded objects further supports the use of dynamic resolution methods, as these objects can be used to encode commands or data in a way that's easily parsed and executed by the malware.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The question describes a scenario involving persistence, evasion, and a specific method of C&C communication.
2. The key elements for determining the ATT&CK technique are the use of JSON-encoded objects and public services as dead drop resolvers for C&C communication.
3. Evaluating each answer choice against these elements, **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** best matches the scenario described, as it encompasses the dynamic resolution of locations for C&C communication, which can include the use of dead drop resolvers and encoded data objects.

**Final Answer: D**
