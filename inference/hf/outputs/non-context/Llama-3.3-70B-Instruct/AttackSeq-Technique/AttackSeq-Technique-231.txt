To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already deployed backdoors as services and has obfuscated their presence using encrypted configuration files. The goal now is to establish secure communication with Command and Control (C2) servers.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the deployment of backdoors, obfuscation of their presence, and the need to establish secure communication with C2 servers. Establishing secure communication implies creating a channel that is not easily detectable or interceptable by security measures.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple, potentially different, communication channels to hide the true destination of the data. While it could be part of establishing secure communication, it doesn't directly address the encryption aspect mentioned.
   - **B: T1548.006-TCC Manipulation**: This technique is related to manipulating the Trusted Certificate Cache on a macOS system, which doesn't directly relate to establishing encrypted communication channels with C2 servers.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to conceal C2 communications, making it difficult for defenders to detect and intercept. Given the context of needing to establish secure communication and the mention of encrypted configuration files, this seems highly relevant.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to evade detection or to gain access to system features. While it's a method used by attackers, it doesn't directly relate to establishing secure communication with C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already deployed backdoors and obfuscated them, indicating a need for stealthy operations.
   - The use of encrypted configuration files suggests the attacker is already utilizing encryption for concealment.
   - To establish secure communication with C2 servers, the attacker would logically use an encrypted channel to prevent interception and detection.
   - Among the given options, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** directly addresses the need for secure, encrypted communication, aligning with the use of encryption for configuration files and the goal of evading detection.

**Final Answer: C**
