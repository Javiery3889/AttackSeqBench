To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the Milestone backdoor sent session information to the C2 server, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The Milestone backdoor sending session information to a C2 (Command and Control) server indicates that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now exfiltrating data or awaiting further commands. This action suggests that the initial compromise and possibly some level of exploration or establishment of persistence have already occurred.

2. **Analyzing Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting content into a website that an adversary has no authority to modify. While it could be a method for initial access or to manipulate users, it doesn't directly relate to the backdoor's communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to gather information about the software running on the system. This could be a step after initial access to understand the environment better, potentially before establishing a backdoor or C2 communication.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for C2 communication. While relevant to the communication aspect, the question specifies that the communication is over an uncompressed channel, which doesn't directly point to the use of a specific application layer protocol as the preceding action.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit**: A rootkit is a software tool that can hide programs or processes from the operating system. While a rootkit could be used to hide the backdoor or its communication, the question focuses on the communication of session information, not the hiding of the backdoor itself.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence**: Given that the Milestone backdoor is already communicating with a C2 server, we're looking for a technique that likely precedes this step in an attack chain. The backdoor's ability to send session information implies that the attacker has already gained access and possibly has an interest in the system's software or configuration.

4. **Conclusion**: Considering the need for an adversary to understand the system they are interacting with before establishing a backdoor or exfiltrating data, **B: T1518-Software Discovery** seems the most plausible technique to have occurred before the Milestone backdoor sent session information to the C2 server. This is because understanding the software environment can help in choosing the right backdoor, configuring it correctly, and ensuring its persistence and stealth.

Final Answer: B
