To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the execution of malicious payloads like SodaMaster using DESLoader through techniques such as DLL side-loading. This indicates an initial access and execution phase where the attacker has already gained access to the system and is executing malicious code. The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next to maintain a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial technique mentioned involves executing malicious code (e.g., through DLL side-loading), which aligns with techniques under "Execution" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, such as T1204 (User Execution) or specifically T1204.002 (Exploitation for Client Execution) for the initial exploitation, but the focus here is on maintaining a foothold.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**: This technique involves obtaining additional credentials for cloud services, which doesn't directly relate to executing files at regular intervals to maintain a foothold on a compromised system.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task or job to execute at a specific time or interval, which aligns with the goal of executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes to maintain a foothold.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves hiding or disguising files or information, which could be part of the attack but doesn't directly address the execution of files at regular intervals.
   - **D: T1136-Create Account**: Creating a new account could be part of establishing a foothold, but it doesn't directly relate to the execution of files at regular intervals.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained initial access and executed malicious code.
   - To maintain a foothold, the attacker needs to ensure persistence, which involves mechanisms to remain on the system despite potential interruptions or system restarts.
   - Executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes suggests a need for a scheduled or periodic execution mechanism.
   - Among the provided options, **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** directly addresses the need for executing tasks at regular intervals, fitting the scenario of maintaining a foothold by periodically executing files.

**Final Answer: B**
