To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a batch file, derived from a decoded CAB file, is used to install a main payload. The key detail is that this process executes the payload without triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up. The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves executing a file (the batch file) that leads to the installation of a payload, all while avoiding a UAC prompt, which typically requires user interaction to elevate privileges.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing involves tricking a user into revealing sensitive information or performing a certain action. While phishing can be used to initially gain access to a system, it doesn't directly relate to executing a payload without triggering UAC.
   - **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves exploiting weaknesses in elevation control mechanisms (like UAC) to gain elevated permissions without prompting the user. This could potentially be used to execute a payload without triggering a UAC pop-up.
   - **C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**: This involves loading a DLL into processes that are launched by the AppInit DLL mechanism. While it can be used for persistence and privilege escalation, it's more about loading code into processes rather than directly avoiding UAC prompts.
   - **D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data**: This involves purchasing technical data, such as software or hardware, that can be used for malicious purposes. It doesn't directly relate to the execution of payloads or evasion of UAC.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the execution of a payload without triggering a UAC pop-up, indicating a need for privilege escalation or elevation control mechanism abuse.
   - Phishing (A) and purchasing technical data (D) are not directly relevant to the technical process of executing a payload while avoiding UAC.
   - AppInit DLLs (C) could be a method for persistence or escalation but doesn't directly address the UAC bypass.
   - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (B) directly addresses the issue of executing a payload with elevated privileges without user interaction, fitting the scenario described.

Final Answer: B
