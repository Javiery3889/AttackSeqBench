To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after LightNeuron discovered system network configurations and before it used a backdoor function to exfiltrate locally collected data, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - LightNeuron used `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` to discover system network configurations. This step indicates the malware's initial phase of reconnaissance, where it gathers information about the system and network it has compromised.
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after this reconnaissance phase but before the exfiltration of locally collected data using a backdoor function.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**: This technique involves modifying or extending the functionality of a network provider to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While it could be related to network activities, it doesn't directly fit the sequence of discovering system configurations and then exfiltrating data.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the actions taken after reconnaissance (discovering system network configurations) and before exfiltration. It makes sense that after gathering system information, the next step would be to collect specific data of interest from the local system.
   - **C: T1123-Audio Capture**: This technique is about capturing audio from the target system, which seems unrelated to the sequence of discovering network configurations and exfiltrating data.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique is about exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is the step mentioned to occur after the technique we are trying to identify. It's the method used for exfiltration, not the step before exfiltration.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the initial action - LightNeuron discovers system network configurations.
   - **Step 2**: Determine the logical next step before exfiltration - Collecting specific data from the local system.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate answer choices based on the sequence - T1005 (Data from Local System) fits as the action taken after reconnaissance and before exfiltration.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred after discovering system network configurations and before using a backdoor for exfiltration is collecting data from the local system.

Final Answer: B
