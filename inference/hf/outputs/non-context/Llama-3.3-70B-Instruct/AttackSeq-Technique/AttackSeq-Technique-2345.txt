To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT, after developing its own remote access tools and utilizing PRC-linked infrastructure, employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this employment.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the development of remote access tools, the use of PRC-linked infrastructure, and the subsequent employment of specific tools (Cobalt Strike and PlugX) for execution. The question hints at a progression from developing or obtaining capabilities to executing them.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to get a victim to install malware or provide sensitive information. While phishing can be an initial access technique, the question focuses on the development and employment of tools rather than the initial access vector.
   - **B: T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This involves modifying web cookies, which doesn't directly relate to the development of remote access tools or the employment of specific execution tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to gain access to a target. While it could be a method for obtaining capabilities, it doesn't directly precede the employment of specific tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX in a straightforward manner.
   - **D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software, tools, or other capabilities that can be used for malicious purposes. Given that BRONZE PRESIDENT developed its own remote access tools and then employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX, obtaining capabilities (either by developing them or acquiring them) seems like a logical precursor to their employment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question implies a progression from capability development/acquisition to execution.
   - The employment of specific tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX suggests that the group had already obtained the necessary capabilities.
   - Therefore, the most logical precursor to employing these tools would be obtaining the capabilities themselves, which aligns with **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**.

**Final Answer: D**
