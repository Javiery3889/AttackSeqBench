To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the implant reduces forensic artifacts and before it steals data, let's analyze the given sequence of actions and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The sequence of actions described involves an implant that:
   - Reduces forensic artifacts by executing a cmd.exe process to delete the dropper binary from the disk. This action suggests the adversary is trying to cover their tracks, which aligns with techniques like **T1070.004 - File Deletion** (not listed but relevant for understanding the context).
   - Actively steals data from applications using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module. This action is indicative of techniques related to credential theft or input capture, such as **T1056 - Keylogging**.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique involves the use of inter-process communication (IPC) to interact with other processes. While IPC can be used for various purposes, including data theft, it's more about the method of communication rather than the act of stealing data itself or covering tracks.
   - **B: T1021.004-SSH**: This technique involves using SSH to establish a secure connection to a remote system. It doesn't directly relate to the actions described (deleting artifacts and stealing data via keylogging).
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making files or data difficult to detect or understand. Given that the implant is trying to reduce forensic artifacts, using obfuscated files or information could be a plausible step to evade detection before proceeding with data theft.
   - **D: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations**: This technique is related to modifying cloud infrastructure configurations, which doesn't directly align with the actions described (focusing on local system artifact removal and data theft).

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The implant's action to delete the dropper binary indicates an attempt to evade detection.
   - Before stealing data, the implant would likely want to ensure it remains undetected.
   - Obfuscating files or information (T1027) would help in maintaining stealth, making it harder for security tools to detect the implant's presence.
   - The described actions (deleting artifacts and then stealing data) suggest a focus on local system interaction rather than remote access or cloud configuration modifications.

**Final Answer: C**
