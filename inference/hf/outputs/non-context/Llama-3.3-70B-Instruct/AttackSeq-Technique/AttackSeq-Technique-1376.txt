To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers use specific modules ('Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp') to gather system information such as browser history and external IP addresses before deploying persistence modules.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned involves collecting system and network information, which is a part of the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies (A)**: This technique involves exploiting trust relationships within a network, which doesn't directly relate to the initial collection of system and network information.
   - **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller (B)**: This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to manipulate network traffic, which is more related to manipulation and control rather than initial reconnaissance.
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration (C)**: This technique is about automatically exfiltrating data, which is not directly related to the collection of system and network information for the purpose of understanding the victim's environment.
   - **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information (D)**: This technique directly involves collecting information about the victim's network, which aligns with the use of modules to gather system information and understand the network layout before further actions.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the reconnaissance phase where attackers are gathering information about the victim's system and network.
   - The use of 'Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp' modules to collect system information such as browser history and external IP addresses indicates an effort to understand the victim's network and system setup.
   - Among the given options, **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** is the technique that most closely matches the activity of collecting system and network information during the reconnaissance phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this context involves gathering victim network information.

Final Answer: D
