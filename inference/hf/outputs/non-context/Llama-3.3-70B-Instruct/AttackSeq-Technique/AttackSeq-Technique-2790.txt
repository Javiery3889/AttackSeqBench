To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an iOS malware app is installed with a hidden icon and runs in the background. It then begins collecting sensitive information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the app started collecting this information.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the installation of the malware app, its ability to run in the background without being easily detectable (due to the hidden icon), and its capability to collect sensitive user data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to make it difficult to detect or interpret. While data encoding might be used at some point during the attack (e.g., to exfiltrate data without detection), it doesn't directly relate to the initial execution or installation of the malware.
   - **B: T1055.005-Thread Local Storage**: This technique involves using thread local storage to store data in a multithreaded process. It's more related to how an adversary might hide or store data within a process rather than the initial step of executing the malware.
   - **C: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code by convincing a user to run it. Given that the malware app is installed and runs in the background immediately, it suggests that the user was tricked into installing the app, which then executes without further user interaction.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This technique is about using systemd timers for persistence and execution. While it could be relevant for maintaining persistence, it's less directly related to the initial execution of the malware after installation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware app's ability to run immediately after installation with a hidden icon suggests that the user was tricked into installing it.
   - The collection of sensitive data follows the execution of the malware, indicating that the initial step was getting the malware to run on the device.
   - Among the given options, **T1204-User Execution** is the technique that best aligns with the initial step of the attack sequence described, as it involves executing malicious code by tricking the user into running it.

**Final Answer: C**
