To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after using obfuscated code to redirect users to malicious webpages or legitimate sites in their phishing campaigns, Sofacy attempted to steal credentials from victims. The key elements here are the use of obfuscated code for redirection and the goal of stealing credentials.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial action involves obfuscation (using obfuscated code), which is a technique used to hide malicious intent. The primary goal, however, is to steal credentials, which suggests a technique focused on credential theft.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes to obtain credentials. It's a direct method of stealing credentials and could be used after a victim is redirected to a malicious site.
   - **B: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This involves creating fake web credentials, which doesn't directly align with stealing existing credentials from victims.
   - **C: T1556.004-Network Device Authentication**: This technique is about authenticating to a network device, which is not directly related to the described phishing campaign aimed at stealing user credentials.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: While this involves obfuscation, the question already states that obfuscation was used, and we're looking for the technique that follows, which is aimed at stealing credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial step involves phishing and redirection using obfuscated code.
   - The goal is to steal credentials, indicating a need for a technique that directly facilitates this.
   - Among the options, keylogging (T1056.001) is a common method used by attackers to capture credentials after a victim has been redirected to a malicious site or has unknowingly installed malware.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of stealing credentials after redirecting users, the most plausible technique is keylogging, as it directly aligns with the goal of capturing credentials.

Final Answer: A
