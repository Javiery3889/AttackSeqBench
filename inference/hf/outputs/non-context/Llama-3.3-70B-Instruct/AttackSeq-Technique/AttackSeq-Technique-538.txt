To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the execution of a renamed `rundll32.exe` as `ActiveFlash.exe` to perform malicious actions. The focus is on what happens after this execution, specifically regarding ensuring the malware's automatic startup during system boot or user logon.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key detail here is the malware's need to start automatically during system boot or user logon after its initial execution. This implies a technique related to persistence, which is a common goal of malware to maintain access to a compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a legitimate process. While it could be related to persistence, it's more about redirecting the execution of a program.
   - **B: T1546.002-Screensaver**: This involves using a screensaver to execute malware. It's a specific method of autostarting malware but doesn't directly relate to the general scenario of ensuring startup during boot or logon after initial execution.
   - **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This is a duplicate of option A and thus shares the same analysis.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique directly involves methods for achieving automatic execution of malware during system boot or user logon, which aligns with the goal mentioned in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies the need for the malware to start automatically after its initial execution.
   - The technique must relate to persistence and autostart mechanisms.
   - Option D, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, directly addresses methods for achieving automatic startup, making it the most relevant to the scenario described.

**Final Answer: D**
