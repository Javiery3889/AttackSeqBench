To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where initial access is gained through modifying Windows executables downloaded via a malicious Tor exit node. After this access is achieved, a wrapper writes both the original and malicious executables to disk and then executes them. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during this process.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key actions here are the writing of executables to disk and their subsequent execution. This implies a technique related to executing or loading code on the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1059.009-Cloud API**: This technique involves using cloud services' APIs for command and control or data exfiltration, which doesn't directly relate to writing and executing executables on a local system.
   - **B: T1200-Hardware Additions**: This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access or control, which is unrelated to the execution of software or writing files to disk.
   - **C: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery**: This technique is about discovering Wi-Fi networks, which doesn't fit the context of executing files on a compromised system.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves executing shared modules (like DLLs) to evade detection or achieve persistence. Writing executables to disk and executing them could be part of loading shared modules, especially if the malicious executable is designed to load additional modules or if the original executable is used as a proxy to load malicious code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario involves modifying executables and executing them, which suggests a focus on code execution techniques.
   - The action of writing to disk and executing implies a need for the system to load the malicious code, potentially as part of a larger payload or to establish persistence.
   - Given the choices, **T1129-Shared Modules** is the most relevant because it directly involves the execution of code on the system, which can include writing executables or modules to disk as part of the attack.

5. **Final Answer**: 
Given the context of writing and executing executables, and considering the provided options, **D: T1129-Shared Modules** seems the most plausible technique related to the described actions, as it involves executing code on the compromised system, which aligns with the scenario of writing and executing files.

**Final Answer: D**
