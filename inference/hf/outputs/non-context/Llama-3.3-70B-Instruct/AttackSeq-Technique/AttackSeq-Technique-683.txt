To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has achieved lateral movement within a network by exploiting specific vulnerabilities (MS08-067 and MS10-061). The goal now is to identify the ATT&CK technique that would most likely be used to send data and receive commands or updates from predefined URLs.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves exploiting vulnerabilities for lateral movement, followed by an action that involves communication with external entities (receiving commands or updates and sending data).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1608.002-Upload Tool**: This technique involves uploading tools to a target system. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to sending data and receiving commands or updates from predefined URLs.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting the trust of a system by manipulating its controls. It's more about bypassing security mechanisms rather than communicating with external entities.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. Given the context of sending data and receiving commands or updates, this seems highly relevant as it directly involves communication over predefined protocols, which could include HTTP/HTTPS to interact with predefined URLs.
   - **D: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**: This technique is about impersonating protocols or services, which could be part of an attack but doesn't directly match the action of sending and receiving data as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained access and is moving laterally, indicating a need for command and control.
   - The action of sending data and receiving commands or updates from predefined URLs suggests a need for a technique that facilitates communication.
   - Among the given options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most directly related to using protocols for communication, which fits the scenario of interacting with predefined URLs for C2 purposes.

**Final Answer: C**
