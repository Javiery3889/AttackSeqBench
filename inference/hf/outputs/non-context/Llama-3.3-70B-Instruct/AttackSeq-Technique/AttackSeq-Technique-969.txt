To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Aria-body backdoor collected extensive system information but before engaging in the collection of file metadata and taking screenshots, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The Aria-body backdoor has already collected extensive system information, including host-name, username, and system architecture. This indicates that the initial stages of reconnaissance and possibly initial access have been completed. The next steps in the attack sequence involve collecting file metadata and taking screenshots, which are part of the discovery and collection phases of an attack.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1614-System Location Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's geographic location. While it could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it doesn't directly relate to the collection of system information like host-name, username, and system architecture, nor does it directly precede the collection of file metadata and taking screenshots in a typical attack sequence.
   - **B: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to gather information about accounts on the system. Given that the backdoor has already collected usernames, this could be a plausible next step as it aligns with further system reconnaissance and could occur before more invasive actions like collecting file metadata and taking screenshots.
   - **C: T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This is a technique used to establish a covert communication channel. While it could be used at various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly follow the collection of system information in a logical sequence leading to the collection of file metadata and taking screenshots.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is about securing the communication between the adversary and the compromised system. This could happen at various points in the attack but doesn't specifically fit as a direct precursor to collecting file metadata and taking screenshots based on the information given.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Aria-body backdoor has collected basic system information.
   - The next logical steps in an attack sequence after initial system reconnaissance would involve more detailed discovery, which could include account discovery to understand the system's user landscape better.
   - Collecting file metadata and taking screenshots are actions that would typically follow initial system and account discovery, as they provide more specific, detailed information about the system and its data.
   - Among the given options, **B: T1087-Account Discovery** most closely aligns with the sequence of actions an adversary would take after initial system information collection and before engaging in more detailed data collection activities like file metadata collection and screenshotting.

**Final Answer: B**
