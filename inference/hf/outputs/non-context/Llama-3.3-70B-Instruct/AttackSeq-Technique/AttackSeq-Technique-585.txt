To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the use of the AntSword webshell for running commands and uploading tools, and the use of Mimikatz for credential dumping.
   - It also mentions the use of Impacket's atexec tool to run commands on other systems in the network.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after these actions, specifically after using atexec.

2. **Understanding the Tools and Techniques**:
   - **AntSword webshell**: A webshell that allows attackers to run commands on a compromised web server.
   - **Mimikatz**: A tool used for credential dumping, allowing attackers to obtain passwords or other authentication material from the system.
   - **Impacket's atexec**: A tool that allows execution of commands on remote systems, often using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.
   - Given this context, the attackers are already inside the network, have obtained credentials, and are moving laterally.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1087-Account Discovery**: This involves the adversary attempting to get a listing of accounts on a system or within an environment. While possible, this doesn't directly follow the use of atexec for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using SMB to interact with remote systems, which aligns with the use of atexec for lateral movement. However, the question asks for the technique that occurs after using atexec.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: Given that the attackers have already used Mimikatz for credential dumping, using alternate authentication material (like stolen credentials) to access other systems or services is a logical next step, especially after moving laterally with atexec.
   - **D: T1137-Office Application Startup**: This involves using the startup functionality of an office application to execute malicious code. While it's a technique for persistence or execution, it doesn't directly follow the lateral movement and credential dumping context provided.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have gained access and are moving laterally within the network.
   - They've used Mimikatz, indicating an interest in credentials.
   - The use of atexec for lateral movement suggests they're expanding their reach within the network.
   - The next logical step, given the context of credential dumping and lateral movement, would be to use those credentials or other authentication material to access more systems, services, or data.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Given the context and the logical progression of the attack, the most plausible next technique after using atexec, especially considering the prior use of Mimikatz for credential dumping, is to **use the obtained credentials or alternate authentication material**.

Final Answer: C
