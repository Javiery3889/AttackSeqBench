To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence initiated by Patchwork, a known threat actor, using exploited CVE-2017-8759 (though it's mentioned as CVE-2017-8750, which might be a typo) through malicious RTF documents for initial access. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique likely used during the Reconnaissance phase to target recipients of spear phishing emails.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial access is achieved through exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-8759) via malicious RTF documents. The question then shifts to the Reconnaissance phase, where the attacker aims to identify targeted recipients who interacted with their spear phishing emails.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This technique involves using scripting tools like AutoHotKey and AutoIT for executing malicious scripts. While useful in various stages of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to identifying targeted recipients during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **B: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**: This technique involves searching open technical databases for information that could be used to gain access or to support other phases of the attack. It could be relevant for reconnaissance but is more about gathering general information rather than specifically identifying recipients of spear phishing emails.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique directly involves phishing activities aimed at gathering information, which could include identifying potential targets or understanding their interaction with phishing emails. It aligns closely with the goal of identifying targeted recipients during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious content, which is more related to the initial access or execution phase rather than the reconnaissance phase focused on identifying targeted recipients.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique used during the Reconnaissance phase to identify targeted recipients of spear phishing emails.
   - The correct answer should directly relate to gathering information about potential targets or understanding their interaction with phishing emails.
   - Among the given options, **T1598-Phishing for Information** is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it involves using phishing to gather information, which can include identifying targeted recipients.

**Final Answer: C**
