To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically Naikon APT, has performed internal reconnaissance on a victim machine. This reconnaissance includes gathering system architecture and open TCP/UDP tables.
   - The key detail is the secure transmission of this gathered data to a Command and Control (C&C) domain.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The first step mentioned is the gathering of system information (reconnaissance), which aligns with techniques related to discovery.
   - The second step involves securely transmitting this data to the C&C domain, which implies the use of a secure communication channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection, which could be part of the process but doesn't directly imply secure transmission.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems, which doesn't directly relate to the transmission of data to a C&C server.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which directly aligns with securely transmitting data to a C&C domain.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**: While this technique is about discovering system information, the question already assumes this step has been completed (as the data is being transmitted), so it doesn't fit the action of transmitting data securely.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies that the data is "securely transmitted," which implies the use of encryption to protect the data in transit.
   - Establishing an encrypted channel (T1573) is a technique that directly supports the secure transmission of data, making it the most plausible next step after gathering system information.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred when Naikon APT securely transmitted the reconnaissance data to the C&C domain is related to creating a secure, encrypted channel for this communication.

Final Answer: C
