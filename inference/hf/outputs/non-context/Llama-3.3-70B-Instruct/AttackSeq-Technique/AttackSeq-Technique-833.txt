To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after WinDealer encoded its configuration files using XOR for defense evasion and before it discovered network configuration and SNS application details on the victim's PC, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - The question mentions that WinDealer encoded its configuration files using XOR for defense evasion. This implies an action taken by the malware to avoid detection, which aligns with techniques used for evasion.
   - The question then asks for the technique that occurred before the discovery of network configuration and SNS application details. This implies we are looking for an action that facilitates exploration or information gathering within the victim's system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action is defense evasion through encoding (using XOR).
   - The subsequent action we are trying to identify involves gathering information about the system or network.
   - The final action mentioned is the discovery of specific details (network configuration and SNS application details).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows command shell to execute commands. While it could be used for information gathering, it's more of an execution technique rather than specifically focused on discovery or evasion in this context.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system and gather information. This could be a plausible step after evasion and before detailed discovery, as it allows the malware to explore the system without being detected.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising the malware as a legitimate file or process. While it's an evasion technique, it doesn't directly relate to the discovery of system or network details.
   - **D: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography for data encryption. Given that the question mentions XOR encoding (a form of symmetric encryption) for defense evasion, switching to asymmetric cryptography doesn't directly align with the sequence of discovering system details.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware first evades detection by encoding its files.
   - To discover network configuration and SNS application details, the malware would need to interact with the system in a way that allows it to gather this information without being detected.
   - Using native APIs (T1106) would allow the malware to query the system for information in a way that is less likely to be detected, fitting the sequence of actions described.

**Final Answer: B**
