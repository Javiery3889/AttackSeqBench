To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The SolarWinds Orion platform compromise was a significant cyberattack that involved a supply chain compromise. The attackers inserted malicious code into the Orion software, which was then distributed to customers, allowing the attackers to gain access to the customers' systems.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The question mentions the use of "dynamic resolution as a Command and Control technique." This implies that the attackers were using a method to dynamically resolve domains or addresses for command and control (C2) communications. However, before this step, the attackers needed to establish communication with the compromised systems.

3. **Analyzing Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding infrastructure used for command and control. While relevant to C2 communications, it doesn't directly address how the initial communication was facilitated.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communications. Given that the SolarWinds compromise involved malicious code within a legitimate application, using an application layer protocol could be a plausible method for initial communication.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This is the technique used to initially compromise the SolarWinds Orion platform by inserting malicious code into the software. However, the question asks for the technique that "most likely facilitated communication with compromised systems" after the initial compromise.
   - **D: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature**: This technique involves using invalid code signatures to make malicious code appear legitimate. While relevant to evading detection, it doesn't directly address the method of communication.

4. **Evaluating the Best Fit**: The question specifically asks about facilitating communication with compromised systems before using dynamic resolution for C2. Given the context of the SolarWinds compromise, where attackers had already gained access to systems through a supply chain compromise, the most relevant technique for facilitating this initial communication would be using existing application layer protocols, as these are common methods for C2 communication and would be less likely to arouse suspicion.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after the initial supply chain compromise, the attackers would use existing protocols to communicate with the compromised systems before moving to more sophisticated C2 techniques like dynamic resolution.

Final Answer: B
