To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after using harvested credentials with tools like Mimikatz to facilitate credential access and expand within the network, we are looking for the next likely ATT&CK technique as the attacker, Whitefly, moves laterally through compromised systems. The use of Mimikatz indicates that the attacker has already gained access to the network and is looking to further exploit this access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with credential access, likely through credential harvesting and use of tools like Mimikatz. This suggests the attacker has obtained credentials and is using them to move laterally.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1021.005-VNC**: This technique involves using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for remote access. While it's a method for accessing systems remotely, it doesn't directly relate to the use of harvested credentials for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This involves dumping credentials from the operating system. Given that the attacker has already used Mimikatz (a tool often used for credential dumping), this might seem like a plausible next step, but the question implies the attacker has already obtained credentials and is looking to use them for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternate authentication material (like certificates, tokens, etc.) that the attacker has obtained. Given the context of using harvested credentials for lateral movement, this seems like a very plausible next step, as the attacker would use the obtained credentials (or other authentication material) to access other systems.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This involves spearphishing targeted at internal users. While it's a technique used for initial access or privilege escalation, it doesn't directly follow the scenario of using harvested credentials for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained access to the network and has credentials.
   - The use of Mimikatz suggests the attacker is interested in exploiting these credentials for further access.
   - Lateral movement typically involves using obtained credentials or authentication material to access other systems within the network.
   - Among the given options, using alternate authentication material (like harvested credentials) for accessing other systems aligns best with the scenario of lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C**
