To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after exploiting Internet Explorer users through specific CVEs and before leveraging Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Exploitation**: The attack starts with the exploitation of Internet Explorer users via CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411. This action corresponds to exploiting public-facing applications, which is a technique used by attackers to gain initial access.

2. **Given Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**: This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to proxy execution, which could be a post-exploitation technique but doesn't directly relate to the initial exploitation phase or the exploitation of public-facing applications.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique directly aligns with the initial action described, which involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications (in this case, Internet Explorer) to gain access. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred after this exploitation.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection, which could be a plausible step after initial exploitation to maintain access and avoid detection before moving on to more sophisticated actions like leveraging the Microsoft Graph API for command and control.
   - **D: T1003.003-NTDS**: This involves accessing or modifying the NTDS (NT Directory Service) database, which is more related to actions taken after establishing a foothold within a network, particularly for credential access or lateral movement.

3. **Analysis and Reasoning**:
   - The exploitation of Internet Explorer users via CVEs is an initial access technique, specifically **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.
   - After gaining initial access, attackers would likely attempt to **hide their artifacts (T1564-Hide Artifacts)** to avoid detection and maintain their foothold. This would be a logical step before attempting more complex actions like leveraging the Microsoft Graph API for command and control.
   - **T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution** and **T1003.003-NTDS** are both post-exploitation techniques but are more specific to certain actions (proxying execution through trusted utilities and accessing/modifying the NTDS database, respectively) that may not directly follow the initial exploitation in this context.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred after the initial exploitation and before leveraging the Microsoft Graph API for command and control is **hiding artifacts** to avoid detection and ensure the attackers can proceed with their objectives without being discovered.

Final Answer: C
