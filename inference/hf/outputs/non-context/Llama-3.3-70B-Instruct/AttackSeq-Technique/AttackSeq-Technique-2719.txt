To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers used spear-phishing emails that included personal data of a deputy head doctor to deceive targets before gaining initial access through malicious Word documents. The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves social engineering to trick victims into opening malicious documents.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements in the question are the use of spear-phishing emails with personal data to deceive targets, leading to the delivery of malicious Word documents. This indicates a phishing attack that is tailored (spear-phishing) and utilizes personal information to increase the likelihood of success.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves phishing to gather information. While phishing is mentioned, the primary goal in the question seems to be gaining initial access rather than gathering information.
   - **B: T1135-Network Share Discovery**: This technique is about discovering network shares, which doesn't directly relate to the use of spear-phishing emails or the deception described.
   - **C: T1591.002-Business Relationships**: This sub-technique under "Phishing" involves using the context of business relationships to make phishing more believable. Given that the emails featured personal data of the deputy head doctor, this could imply an attempt to leverage a business or professional relationship to deceive targets, making the phishing attempt more targeted and potentially more successful.
   - **D: T1204.002-Malicious File**: This involves delivering malicious files, which is part of the attack but doesn't specifically address the use of crafted emails with personal data to deceive targets.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the method used to deceive targets before delivering malicious files.
   - The use of personal data in emails suggests an attempt to make the phishing more believable and targeted.
   - Among the given options, the one that most closely aligns with using crafted emails featuring personal data to deceive targets, in the context of phishing, is related to leveraging business relationships or personal information to make the phishing attempt more convincing.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack sequence described involves using crafted emails that leverage personal or business relationships to deceive targets. Therefore, the answer choice that best fits this description is **C: T1591.002-Business Relationships**, as it involves using the context of relationships (which could include personal data) to make phishing attempts more believable.

**Final Answer: C**
