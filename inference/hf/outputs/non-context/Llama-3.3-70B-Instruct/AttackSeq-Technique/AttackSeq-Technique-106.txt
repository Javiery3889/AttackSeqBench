To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where Waterbear, presumably a piece of malware, uses API hooking to evade detection. This implies the malware is already present on a compromised system and is taking steps to remain undetected.
   - The specific action of interest is when the malware connects to external entities for receiving additional payloads or files. This action suggests a communication or data transfer technique used by the malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to direct traffic between systems. While it could be related to communication with external entities, it's more about routing traffic within a network rather than directly receiving payloads.
   - **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using tools designed for software deployment to distribute malware. It's plausible but more related to the initial deployment of malware rather than the ongoing communication for receiving additional payloads.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique specifically involves transferring tools or payloads from an external system into the compromised network. This directly aligns with the action of receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique is about hiding artifacts to evade detection, which, while relevant to the initial API hooking for evasion, does not directly relate to the communication for receiving additional payloads.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the action of the malware connecting to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.
   - API hooking is used for evasion, indicating the malware is already on the system and looking to expand its capabilities or receive updates.
   - The most relevant technique for receiving additional payloads or files from external entities is directly related to transferring tools or payloads into the compromised network.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**, as it directly involves the transfer of tools or payloads from an external source into the network, aligning with the described action of the malware.

Final Answer: C
