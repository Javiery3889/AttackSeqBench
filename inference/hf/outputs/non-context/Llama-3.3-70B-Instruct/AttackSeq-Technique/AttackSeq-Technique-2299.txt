To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes involving victim network infrastructure, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step by step.

1. **Understanding DNSpionage**: DNSpionage is a known campaign that involves manipulating DNS records to redirect traffic, often for espionage or other malicious purposes. This implies that the attackers are interested in gathering information or intercepting communications from the targeted organizations.

2. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the malicious redirection of traffic for reconnaissance purposes. This means we are looking for a technique that would logically precede the act of redirecting traffic, which is part of the reconnaissance or exploitation phase of an attack.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which could include IP addresses, network topology, and other relevant details. This information would be crucial for planning and executing a targeted attack, such as DNS manipulation, to redirect traffic effectively.
   - **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**: This technique is related to hiding malicious email rules, which might be part of an attack but doesn't directly relate to the preparation needed for redirecting traffic for reconnaissance purposes.
   - **C: T1590.005-IP Addresses**: While gathering IP addresses is part of gathering victim network information, this option is more specific and doesn't encompass the broader scope of information gathering that would be necessary before executing a DNSpionage attack.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling tasks or jobs on a compromised system, which could be part of maintaining access or executing malicious activities but doesn't directly precede the act of redirecting traffic for reconnaissance.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of DNSpionage and the need for attackers to have some level of understanding of the victim's network infrastructure before they can effectively redirect traffic for reconnaissance, the most logical technique that would occur before such an action is gathering information about the victim's network.

**Final Answer: A**
