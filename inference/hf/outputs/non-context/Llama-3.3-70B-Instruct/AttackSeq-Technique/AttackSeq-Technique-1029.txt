To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions Gamaredon using a backdoor to list interesting files during the discovery phase.
   - It asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action is the use of a backdoor for discovery, implying an initial access and execution phase.
   - The next action involves gathering sensitive documents, which suggests a collection or exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1596.002-WHOIS**: This technique involves using WHOIS to gather information about domain registrations. It doesn't directly relate to gathering sensitive documents from local systems, drives, and network shares.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting the trust of a system by manipulating its trust mechanisms. While it could be part of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the collection of sensitive documents.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves automatically collecting data from a system. Given that Gamaredon used its backdoor to list interesting files, using automated means to collect these files aligns with this technique.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence**: This option seems unrelated as it does not directly pertain to the collection of sensitive documents from systems, drives, and network shares based on standard ATT&CK framework descriptions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies the use of a backdoor for listing files, indicating an initial compromise and discovery phase.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence, given the context, would be to collect the identified interesting files.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection** directly relates to the action of gathering sensitive information automatically, which fits the scenario of using a backdoor to collect files after they have been identified.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Based on the analysis, **C: T1119-Automated Collection** is the most plausible technique for gathering sensitive documents after the initial discovery phase using a backdoor.

Final Answer: C
