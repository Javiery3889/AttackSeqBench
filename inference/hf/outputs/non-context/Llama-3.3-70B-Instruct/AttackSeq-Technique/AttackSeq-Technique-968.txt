To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Naikon APT group's Aria-body loader established persistence, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Initial Action**: The Aria-body loader has already established persistence. This means the malware has ensured it can survive restarts and continue executing on the compromised system. Persistence mechanisms like using the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key are common for this purpose. Injecting itself into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe' suggests the malware is trying to hide its activity within legitimate system processes.

2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves using a local account to maintain access to a system. While account manipulation could be a next step, it doesn't directly follow from establishing persistence and process injection in terms of immediate logical sequence.
   - **B & C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hardware, and configuration. After establishing persistence and injecting into system processes, the next logical step for an attacker would often be to gather more information about the system to plan further actions, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. This technique aligns well with the post-persistence phase of an attack.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is an initial access technique used to trick users into divulging sensitive information or executing malicious code. Given that the malware has already established persistence, phishing would not be a subsequent action in this context.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the sequence of actions described, after establishing persistence and injecting into system processes, the most logical next step for an attacker like the Naikon APT group would be to gather more information about the system to inform their next moves. This makes **T1082-System Information Discovery** the most plausible next technique in the sequence.

**Final Answer: B**
