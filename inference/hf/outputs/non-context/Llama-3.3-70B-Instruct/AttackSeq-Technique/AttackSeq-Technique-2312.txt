To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the adversary used discovery commands (such as PsLogList to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log) and before exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The adversary has already used discovery commands to extract contents from the Windows Security Event Log. This action suggests that the adversary is in the reconnaissance phase, gathering information about the system and its security posture. The next logical step would involve using the gathered information to further compromise the system or prepare for data exfiltration.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing input (e.g., login credentials) from a web portal. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly follow the use of discovery commands like PsLogList or directly precede exfiltration to cloud storage.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from a local system, which aligns with the actions taken after using discovery commands. The adversary, having gathered information about the system's security event log, might proceed to collect specific data of interest from the local system before exfiltrating it.
   - **C: T1218.014-MMC**: This technique refers to exploiting Microsoft Management Console (MMC) vulnerabilities. While exploitation could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of discovering system information and then exfiltrating data.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Although it's about exfiltration, the question specifies exfiltration using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services, which doesn't necessarily involve a traditional C2 channel.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The adversary starts by gathering system information using discovery commands.
   - The next logical step would be to use this information to identify and collect specific data of interest from the local system.
   - Finally, the adversary exfiltrates this collected data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

Given this sequence, **T1005-Data from Local System** is the most plausible technique that occurred after the discovery phase and before the exfiltration of data. It directly relates to the action of collecting data from the system after reconnaissance and before exfiltrating that data.

**Final Answer: B**
