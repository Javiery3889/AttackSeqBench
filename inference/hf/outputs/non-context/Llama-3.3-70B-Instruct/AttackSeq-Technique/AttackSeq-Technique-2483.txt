To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions that adversaries used "reflective code loading" to evade defenses. Reflective code loading is a technique where an attacker loads malicious code into a process's memory without writing it to disk, making it harder for traditional signature-based security solutions to detect. This technique is often associated with evading defenses and is a part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The question implies a sequence where the initial step involves evading defenses using reflective code loading. After this evasion, the attackers would likely attempt to establish a more stable presence within the network or move laterally, which could involve setting up communication channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple, potentially different, communication channels to hide or obscure the command and control (C2) traffic. After evading defenses, establishing a reliable and covert channel for command and control would be a logical next step for attackers to issue commands and receive stolen data.
   - **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**: This sub-technique involves using DNS queries to perform calculations that can help in data exfiltration or establishing C2 channels. While it could be used after evasion, it's more specific to data exfiltration or C2 and might not directly follow evasion techniques as a next step in all scenarios.
   - **C: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**: This involves exploiting weaknesses in conditional access policies to gain unauthorized access. It doesn't directly relate to the actions typically taken after evading defenses using reflective code loading.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. While it could be an initial access vector, it doesn't logically follow the use of reflective code loading as a next step in an attack sequence focused on evasion and persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The use of reflective code loading indicates an attempt to evade defenses, likely as part of an initial access or execution tactic.
   - After evading defenses, the next logical step would involve establishing a means of command and control that is reliable and hard to detect.
   - Among the given options, **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** best fits the description of a technique that would be used after evading defenses, as it involves setting up communication channels that can be used for further malicious activities.

Final Answer: A
