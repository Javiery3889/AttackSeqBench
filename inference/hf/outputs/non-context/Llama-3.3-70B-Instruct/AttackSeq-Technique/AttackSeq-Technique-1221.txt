To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by APT10, focusing on the extraction of data from Dropbox using cURL for Windows. Before this extraction, proprietary data was compressed using WinRAR. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the data compression but before the extraction.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence mentioned involves data compression (using WinRAR) and then accessing cloud storage (Dropbox) to extract data. The techniques mentioned in the choices are:
   - **T1213: Exploitation of Remote Services** - This involves exploiting services that are available remotely, which could include cloud services.
   - **T1021: Remote Services** - This technique involves using remote services to access a network or system, which could be relevant but is more about the use of remote services in general.
   - **T1530: Data from Cloud Storage** - This technique specifically involves collecting data from cloud storage services.
   - **T1614.001: System Language Discovery** - This involves discovering the language settings of a system, which doesn't directly relate to accessing or extracting data from cloud storage.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1213** is about exploiting remote services, which could be relevant but is broader and doesn't specifically mention accessing data from cloud storage.
   - **T1021** is also about using remote services but is more general and doesn't specifically focus on data extraction from cloud storage.
   - **T1530** directly involves collecting data from cloud storage, which aligns with the action of accessing Dropbox to extract data.
   - **T1614.001** is unrelated to the sequence of accessing cloud storage for data extraction.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies that after compressing data with WinRAR, APT10 accessed Dropbox.
   - The action of accessing Dropbox to extract data is most directly related to collecting data from cloud storage.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after the data was compressed (but before the extraction using cURL) is related to accessing cloud storage.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the focus on accessing data from cloud storage (Dropbox) after compressing the data, the most relevant technique is **T1530: Data from Cloud Storage**. However, considering the specific context provided (accessing Dropbox after compressing data), the correct sequence suggests that accessing the cloud storage (Dropbox) would be the action that follows the compression, making **T1530** the most relevant in the context of accessing cloud storage. But, since the question asks for the technique that occurred after the compression but before the extraction (and given that T1530 is about the actual collection from cloud storage), we should consider the broader context of how these techniques are sequenced in an attack. The actual extraction using cURL (which would be part of T1530) happens after accessing the cloud storage service. Therefore, considering the precise sequence and the provided options, **T1021: Remote Services** could be seen as the technique that enables the access to the cloud service (Dropbox) before the data is extracted, but given the direct mention of cloud storage, **T1530** seems more directly relevant to the action of collecting data from cloud storage services like Dropbox.

However, the question's phrasing suggests looking for the technique that occurred after compression but before the extraction method (cURL) is used, which implies looking for an action that precedes the actual data extraction from cloud storage. Given this, and re-evaluating for clarity and precision in the context of ATT&CK techniques and the question's specifics:

**Final Answer: C**
