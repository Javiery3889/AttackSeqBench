To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the malware gathered system and user information, keystrokes, and directory listings during the Discovery phase, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions that during the Discovery phase, the malware gathered system and user information, keystrokes, and directory listings. This phase is about the adversary trying to gather as much information as possible about the system and the environment they are operating in. The techniques used here are typically related to reconnaissance and information gathering.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) here starts with the Discovery phase, which involves gathering information. The next logical step after gathering information would be to use that information for further malicious activities, such as exfiltrating data, establishing persistence, or moving laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves archiving data, which could be a step after gathering information, as the adversary might want to collect and store the gathered data for exfiltration or further analysis.
   - **B: T1114-Email Collection**: Collecting emails could be part of the information gathering process but seems more specific and might not directly follow the broad information gathering described.
   - **C: T1578.003-Delete Cloud Instance**: Deleting a cloud instance seems unrelated to the immediate next steps after information gathering during the Discovery phase, as it's more about impact or evasion.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is an initial access technique and would typically occur before the Discovery phase, not after.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Discovery phase involves gathering information.
   - After gathering system, user, and other sensitive information, the next logical step for an adversary would be to use this information for their advantage, which could involve data exfiltration, further reconnaissance, or establishing persistence.
   - Among the given options, archiving data (A: T1560.002-Archive via Library) seems like a plausible next step as it directly relates to handling the gathered information, potentially for exfiltration or further analysis.

5. **Final Answer**: 
Given the context of the Discovery phase and the actions described, the most likely next technique would involve utilizing or managing the gathered information. 

Final Answer: A
