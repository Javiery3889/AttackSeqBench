To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Lazarus group using spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents to gain initial access. Before this action, the group would need to prepare and target specific individuals within the defense industry. This preparation involves gathering information about potential targets.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTP here involves targeting specific individuals, which implies some form of reconnaissance or information gathering about the targets.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from files. While credential acquisition is a common goal in many attacks, it doesn't directly relate to the preparation and targeting of specific individuals before an attack.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique directly involves collecting information about the victims, such as their identities, roles, or contact information, which can be used to craft targeted attacks like spear-phishing.
   - **C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: Scanning IP blocks is more related to network reconnaissance and doesn't directly contribute to targeting specific individuals within an industry.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools for malicious purposes, which doesn't fit the context of preparing to target individuals before an attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Lazarus group's use of spear-phishing emails indicates a targeted approach, suggesting they had some information about their targets.
   - To target specific individuals within the defense industry effectively, the attackers would need to gather information about these individuals.
   - Among the provided options, **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is the technique that best aligns with the action of preparing and targeting specific individuals before launching a spear-phishing campaign.

**Final Answer: B**
