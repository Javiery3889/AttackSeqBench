To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions stealing credentials from browsers and then uploading stolen keystrokes and screenshots to a Command and Control (C2) infrastructure. This implies a sequence of actions where an attacker first gains access to sensitive information (credentials) and then exfiltrates additional data (keystrokes and screenshots) back to their C2 infrastructure.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key actions here are the initial compromise (stealing credentials), the collection of additional data (keystrokes and screenshots), and the exfiltration of this data to the C2 infrastructure.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1491.002-External Defacement**: This technique involves modifying or replacing content on a website or application to disrupt or deface it, which does not directly relate to the actions described (stealing credentials and uploading keystrokes/screenshots).
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection, which could be a step taken after the initial compromise but does not directly precede the uploading of stolen data to a C2 server.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C2 communications, which aligns with the action of uploading stolen keystrokes and screenshots to a C2 infrastructure. It suggests the use of a web service as a means to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **D: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic between the compromised host and the C2 server, which could be part of the communication process but does not directly relate to the preparation or action of uploading the stolen data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already compromised a system (by stealing credentials) and is now in the process of exfiltrating data (keystrokes and screenshots).
   - The most relevant technique that would occur before uploading this data to a C2 infrastructure involves setting up or utilizing a means of communication with the C2 server.
   - Among the given options, **T1102-Web Service** is the most directly related to establishing a communication channel with a C2 infrastructure for the purpose of uploading stolen data.

**Final Answer: C**
