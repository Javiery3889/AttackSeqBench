To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with ChromeLoader gaining initial access through a DMG (Disk Image) file containing a shell script. This indicates the attacker has successfully executed code on the victim's system, likely through social engineering or exploiting a vulnerability.

2. **Technique Occurrence**: We are looking for an ATT&CK technique that would logically occur after the initial access (via the DMG and shell script) but before the establishment of persistence using a Chrome browser extension.

3. **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1176-Browser Extensions**: This technique involves modifying or adding browser extensions to maintain access. Given that the question specifies the establishment of persistence with a Chrome browser extension as a later step, this technique would not occur before that step.
   - **B: T1547.008-LSASS Driver**: This involves modifying or adding LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) drivers to capture credentials. While credential access is a common goal, there's no direct indication in the question that credential capture is the immediate next step after initial access, especially considering the context of a macOS attack and the use of a Chrome browser extension for persistence.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to establish a command and control channel. After gaining initial access, an attacker might use web services to communicate with the compromised system, which could be a logical step before establishing persistence, as it would allow the attacker to issue commands and potentially prepare the system for further exploitation.
   - **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique is about compromising infrastructure, which seems less directly related to the immediate post-initial access activities on a single compromised system, especially in the context provided.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of the attack sequence, where the attacker has gained initial access and is preparing to establish persistence with a Chrome browser extension, the most plausible next step would involve setting up a means of command and control or further exploitation. Among the provided options, **T1102-Web Service** seems the most likely technique to occur after initial access but before establishing persistence with a browser extension, as it facilitates communication and potential further instruction from the attacker.

Final Answer: C
