To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Korplug, presumably a piece of malware, has already collected data from local and networked drives and gathered system information. The next step involves facilitating encrypted communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers for further interaction, specifically mentioning the use of fallback C&C servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves data collection, system information gathering, and then establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers. The focus is on the method used for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing communication between the malware and the C&C server, allowing for both the sending and receiving of data. While it does involve communication, the question specifically mentions encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers, which isn't explicitly covered by this option.
   - **B: T1027.003-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding malicious data within non-malicious data to avoid detection. While steganography can be used for covert communication, the question emphasizes encrypted communication with C&C servers, not necessarily hiding data within other data.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This option seems unrelated to the task of establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers. It's more about collecting data from shared drives, which is mentioned as already accomplished in the question.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) for C&C communication. It can include encrypted communication and is a common method for interacting with C&C servers, including fallback servers, as it allows for flexibility and evasion techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that facilitates encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers.
   - Encrypted communication implies a method that can securely transmit data between the malware and the C&C server.
   - Fallback C&C servers suggest a need for flexibility and redundancy in communication methods.
   - Among the options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant to establishing and maintaining communication with C&C servers, including the use of encryption and the potential for fallback servers.

**Final Answer: D**
