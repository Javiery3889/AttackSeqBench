To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers use a Flash exploit ('show.swf') to trigger a specific vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119). The goal is to identify the MITRE ATT&CK technique most likely used to maintain the attack and embed a payload in an image ('b.gif') for subsequent execution.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) using a Flash exploit, and then using this exploit to embed a payload in an image for execution. This suggests a technique that involves exploiting vulnerabilities for the purpose of executing malicious code on a client system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1543.001-Launch Agent**: This technique involves launching an agent (a small program) on a compromised system. While it's related to executing code, it doesn't directly relate to exploiting vulnerabilities for client execution.
   - **B: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to evade defenses, not directly for executing code or embedding payloads.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique directly involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute malicious code on a client system, which aligns with the scenario of exploiting a Flash vulnerability to execute a payload embedded in an image.
   - **D: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools**: This technique involves modifying or disabling security tools, which doesn't directly relate to exploiting vulnerabilities for code execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes an exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to execute malicious code.
   - The goal is to identify a technique that aligns with exploiting vulnerabilities for the purpose of executing code on a client system.
   - T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution directly involves exploiting vulnerabilities to achieve client-side code execution, fitting the scenario described.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate technique that aligns with the exploitation of a vulnerability to execute malicious code (in this case, embedding a payload in an image for execution) is **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.

Final Answer: C
