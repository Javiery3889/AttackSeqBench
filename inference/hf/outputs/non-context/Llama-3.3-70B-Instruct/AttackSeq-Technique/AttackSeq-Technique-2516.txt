To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary first compromises a computer using GreyEnergy malware.
   - The adversary then uses Nmap and Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator privileges. This step involves network reconnaissance (Nmap) and credential harvesting (Mimikatz).
   - Finally, the adversary performs lateral movement using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial compromise and the use of Nmap and Mimikatz suggest the adversary has gained access and is escalating privileges.
   - The use of SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement indicates the adversary is moving laterally within the network, likely using legitimate administrative tools to avoid detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems, which could be relevant if the adversary is using harvested credentials for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services to access systems, which aligns with the use of tools like PsExec for executing commands on remote systems.
   - **C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves targeting users within the organization with spearphishing emails, which does not directly relate to the lateral movement described.
   - **D: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription:** This technique involves using WMI to subscribe to events, which could be used for persistence or monitoring but doesn't directly align with the lateral movement tools mentioned.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversary has already obtained domain administrator privileges, indicating they have valid accounts or the means to use them (T1078).
   - The use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement suggests the exploitation of remote services (T1021) to access and execute commands on other systems within the network.
   - Given the context of lateral movement and the tools used, the most relevant technique is the one that involves accessing systems remotely, which is a key aspect of the described activity.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the lateral movement using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe, after obtaining domain administrator privileges, is related to accessing systems remotely. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that corresponds to the use of remote services for lateral movement.

Final Answer: B
