To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving APT10, a known advanced persistent threat group. The techniques mentioned include:
   - Using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2).
   - Employing tools like Robocopy and PSCP for secure data transfer.

   The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable the actor to exfiltrate data from victim networks to their C2 servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system. While credential dumping can be a part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to exfiltrating data to C2 servers.
   - **B: T1602.002-Network Device Configuration Dump**: This involves stealing network device configuration data. It's not directly related to the exfiltration of general data from victim networks to C2 servers.
   - **C: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud-based text storage services. While it is a method of exfiltration, the question specifically mentions exfiltration to C2 servers, not text storage sites.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique directly involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which aligns with the scenario described. The use of dynamic-DNS domains for C2 and tools for secure data transfer sets up a scenario where data could be exfiltrated back to the attackers' C2 servers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines a scenario where APT10 uses specific methods for command and control and data transfer.
   - The goal is to identify the technique used for exfiltrating data to C2 servers.
   - Given the context of using C2 channels and secure data transfer tools, the most relevant technique for exfiltrating data back to the attackers would be over the established C2 channel.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred to enable the actor to exfiltrate data from victim networks to their C2 servers is exfiltration over the C2 channel.

Final Answer: D
