To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the initial discovery by CosmicDuke, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - The initial action involves CosmicDuke conducting discovery by searching for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames. This action suggests that the adversary is looking for specific data or files that could be of interest.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred next to gather information from the victim's system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial technique used by CosmicDuke involves discovery, which could be mapped to techniques like `T1083 - File and Directory Discovery`. However, the question focuses on what happens next in terms of gathering more information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task or job to execute at a specific time or interval. While it could be used for persistence or execution, it doesn't directly relate to gathering information from the victim's system immediately after discovery.
   - **B: T1115 - Clipboard Data**: This technique involves capturing the clipboard data, which could potentially reveal sensitive information such as passwords or encryption keys. However, it's more of a specific action rather than a broad information-gathering technique.
   - **C: T1547.006 - Kernel Modules and Extensions**: This technique involves modifying kernel modules or extensions to hide malware or gain persistence. It's more related to evasion and persistence rather than initial information gathering.
   - **D: T1113 - Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's system, which can reveal a wide range of information, including open documents, chat windows, and other sensitive data. It's a direct method of gathering visual information from the victim's system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Given that CosmicDuke has already conducted an initial discovery, the next logical step would be to gather more specific or detailed information from the system.
   - Among the provided options, **T1113 - Screen Capture** stands out as a technique that directly allows the adversary to gather a broad range of information from the victim's system, including potentially sensitive data displayed on the screen.
   - While other techniques like scheduling tasks or modifying kernel modules could be part of the attack sequence, they don't directly align with the immediate goal of gathering information as described.

**Final Answer: D**
