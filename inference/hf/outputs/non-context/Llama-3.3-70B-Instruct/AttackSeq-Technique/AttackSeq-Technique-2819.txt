To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions that after Derusbi (a type of malware) gathered system information for discovery, we are looking for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to establish communication with the command and control (C2) server.
   - The specific method of communication mentioned is via HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is about gathering information about the system, which has already been done by Derusbi according to the question. So, this is not the next step.
   - **B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This involves establishing communication between the malware and the C2 server, allowing for both sending and receiving data. Given that the question mentions establishing communication via HTTP POST requests, this seems like a plausible next step.
   - **C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This technique involves using asynchronous procedure calls to evade detection, which doesn't directly relate to establishing C2 communication via HTTP.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: While this technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP) for C2 communication, the specific mention of establishing communication and the context provided aligns more closely with bidirectional communication.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the action of gathering system information as a precursor to the next step, which is already done by Derusbi.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the need for establishing communication with a C2 server, which involves sending and potentially receiving data.
   - **Step 3**: Evaluate the options based on the context of establishing C2 communication via HTTP POST requests.
   - **Step 4**: Choose the option that best aligns with the described action of establishing communication for potential bidirectional data exchange.

Given the context and the need for establishing a communication channel with the C2 server for further operations, the most appropriate technique after system discovery would be related to setting up a means for the malware to communicate back to its operators.

Final Answer: B
