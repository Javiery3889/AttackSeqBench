To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke, a type of malware, has collected sensitive information from a victim's system using various tools such as keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitates the transfer of this collected information to remote servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves obtaining data from a removable media device. It does not directly relate to transferring collected information from a compromised system to remote servers over a network.
   - **B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique is about collecting network information from the victim, not about exfiltrating (transferring out) collected sensitive data to remote servers.
   - **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system, which could include using tools like keyloggers and screenshotters to collect data and then automatically sending it to the attackers. However, it's a broader category and doesn't specifically mention the use of web services.
   - **D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which could include uploading stolen data to a cloud service, web application, or other web services accessible from the internet. Given that CosmicDuke has collected sensitive information and needs to transfer it to remote servers, using a web service is a plausible method for doing so, especially in a scenario where direct network connections might be monitored or blocked.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the goal of the attacker, which is to transfer collected sensitive information from the victim's system to remote servers.
   - **Step 2**: Evaluate each option based on how well it aligns with the goal of transferring data to remote servers.
   - **Step 3**: Recognize that while T1020 (Automated Exfiltration) could apply, T1567 (Exfiltration Over Web Service) is more specific to the scenario of transferring data to remote servers, especially in a context where web services are commonly used for such activities.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the specifics of the question, the most appropriate technique for transferring collected sensitive information to remote servers, especially in a modern context where web services are prevalent, is exfiltration over a web service.

Final Answer: D
