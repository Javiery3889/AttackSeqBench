To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has exploited known vulnerabilities using malicious documents. This initial step suggests the attacker has gained access to a system and is now looking to establish command and control (C2) communication. The question specifically asks about concealing the identity of the C2 server during this communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with exploiting vulnerabilities (likely through T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application or a similar technique, though not directly mentioned), followed by the need to conceal C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves using non-standard encoding to hide the content of communication. While encoding can be used to evade detection, it doesn't directly conceal the identity of the C2 server.
   - **B: T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download or execute files. It's more about transferring files under the radar rather than concealing the identity of a C2 server.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is about tricking users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. It's not directly related to concealing C2 server identities during communication.
   - **D: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to redirect traffic, which can effectively conceal the true IP address (and thus the identity) of a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained access and is looking to hide the C2 server's identity.
   - Concealing the identity of a C2 server is crucial for maintaining anonymity and avoiding detection.
   - Among the given options, using a proxy (T1090) is the most direct method to achieve this, as it acts as an intermediary, making it appear as though the communication is coming from the proxy's IP address rather than the actual C2 server's IP address.

**Final Answer: D**
