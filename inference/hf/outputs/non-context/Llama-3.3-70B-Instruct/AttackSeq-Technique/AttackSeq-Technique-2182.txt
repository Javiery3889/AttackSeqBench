To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Taidoor malware has already executed and modified the Windows Registry to enable attacker operations. It's looking for the ATT&CK technique that allows the malware to maintain persistence through automated actions during boot or logon.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key TTPs mentioned are the execution of a small executable file, modification of the Windows Registry, and the goal of maintaining persistence on infected systems during boot or logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**: This technique involves obtaining authentication to a domain controller, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining persistence on an already compromised system through boot or logon actions.
   - **B: T1037-Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts**: This technique involves using scripts that run at boot or logon to establish persistence. While it's related to the boot/logon phase, it specifically mentions scripts, which might not be the only method for achieving persistence in this context.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon, which aligns closely with the goal of maintaining persistence through automated actions at these times.
   - **D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique is about communicating between different processes, which doesn't directly relate to achieving persistence during boot or logon.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already gained access and modified the registry, indicating it's past the initial access phase.
   - The goal now is to maintain persistence, which means ensuring the malware remains active even after a system reboot or user logoff/logon.
   - Among the given options, **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** directly addresses the need for malware to automatically start during boot or logon, fitting the requirement for maintaining persistence through automated actions at these times.

**Final Answer: C**
