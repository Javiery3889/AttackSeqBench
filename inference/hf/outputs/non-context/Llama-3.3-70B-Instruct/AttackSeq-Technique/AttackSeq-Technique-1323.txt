To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the initial actions described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an initial set of actions taken by the CosmicDuke malware, including achieving persistence through creating a scheduled task and configuring a Windows service. After these initial steps, the malware proceeds to search hard drives and network drives for specific file patterns, including targeting non-English filenames.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial actions involve persistence techniques, specifically creating a scheduled task (which could relate to T1053-Scheduled Task/Job) and configuring a service. However, the question asks about the technique that follows these actions, which involves searching for specific files.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1538-Cloud Service Dashboard**: This technique involves using cloud services' dashboards to gather information about the environment. It doesn't directly relate to searching local or network drives for files.
   - **B: T1055.015-ListPlanting**: This sub-technique involves creating a list of files or directories to be used for subsequent actions but is more specific to planting files rather than discovering them.
   - **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary searching the file system to gather information about the system's layout, configuration, and potential targets. This includes searching for specific files or directories, which aligns with the described behavior of searching hard drives and network drives for specific file patterns.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: While this technique is relevant to the initial action of creating a scheduled task for persistence, it doesn't directly relate to the subsequent action of searching for files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial actions are about establishing persistence.
   - The subsequent action described is about searching for specific files, which is a discovery technique.
   - Among the given choices, **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** is the technique that directly involves searching the file system for specific files or directories, which matches the described behavior of the malware.

**Final Answer: C**
