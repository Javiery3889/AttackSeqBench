To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attack remains undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts, and it involves the exfiltration of stolen credentials to an FTP server. The key point here is the use of legitimate tools to evade detection.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Using legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection.
   - Exfiltrating stolen credentials to an FTP server.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which doesn't directly relate to using legitimate tools to evade detection.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising tools, scripts, or other artifacts to make them appear as something else. This could include using legitimate tools or scripts to perform malicious activities without being detected, fitting the description of using legitimate means to evade detection.
   - **C: T1053.002-At**: This sub-technique involves using the Windows `at` command to schedule tasks, which is a form of scheduled task/job, but it doesn't directly relate to the use of legitimate tools for evasion in the context provided.
   - **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to access systems, which, while relevant to the use of credentials, doesn't directly address the evasion through legitimate tools aspect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question emphasizes evasion through the use of legitimate tools and scripts.
   - Masquerading (T1036) is about making malicious tools or scripts appear legitimate, which aligns with the goal of evading detection by blending in with normal system activity.
   - The other options, while related to credential access or execution, do not directly address the aspect of evasion through masquerading as legitimate activities.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the technique that most likely enabled the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors is **B: T1036-Masquerading**.

Final Answer: B
