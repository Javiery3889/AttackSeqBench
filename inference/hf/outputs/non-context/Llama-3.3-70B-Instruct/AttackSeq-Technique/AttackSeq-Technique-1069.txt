To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions collecting and exfiltrating system information and screenshots to an attacker-controlled Mattermost server. The key detail here is the exfiltration of data to a server using HTTP on port 443. This implies that the attacker is using a web service for communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves data exfiltration, which is a tactic. The technique in question involves using a web service (HTTP on port 443) for this exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service. Given that the data is being sent to a server using HTTP on port 443, this technique directly aligns with the described action.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**: While this does involve web services, it's more about using web services for command and control (C2) rather than specifically exfiltrating data.
   - **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This involves using a protocol to tunnel another protocol, which is not directly indicated by the use of HTTP on port 443 for data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is about achieving persistence through autostart mechanisms and does not relate to data exfiltration or communication with a server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies exfiltration of data to a server.
   - The use of HTTP on port 443 indicates a web service.
   - T1567 directly involves exfiltrating data over web services, which matches the scenario.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the details in the question and the analysis above, the most appropriate technique that facilitated the communication with the server using HTTP on port 443 for exfiltrating system information and screenshots is exfiltration over a web service.

Final Answer: A
