To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after DRAGONFISH performed system information collection, retrieved installed software, and proxy details as part of its reconnaissance, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - The question mentions that DRAGONFISH has already performed system information collection. This includes retrieving installed software and proxy details, which are crucial for understanding the target system's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.
   - The techniques mentioned (system information collection, retrieving installed software, and proxy details) are part of the reconnaissance phase, where an attacker gathers information about the target system to plan further actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance, where system information, installed software, and proxy details are collected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system and execute system calls. While it could be used after reconnaissance to further interact with the system, it's not directly related to the next logical step after collecting system information.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about running processes on the system. After collecting general system information, discovering running processes would be a logical next step to understand what's currently active on the system and to identify potential targets or processes to interact with or exploit.
   - **C: T1069.002-Domain Groups**: This technique is about discovering domain groups, which could be part of the reconnaissance but is more specific to Active Directory environments and might not directly follow the collection of system and software information in all scenarios.
   - **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports, which could be a method for establishing command and control (C2) or for other malicious communications. While it's a possible action after reconnaissance, it doesn't directly follow from collecting system and software information without additional context about establishing C2 channels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial steps involved collecting broad system information, including software and proxy settings.
   - The next logical step would be to gather more detailed information about the system's current state, such as which processes are running.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** directly aligns with this next step as it involves gathering information about the running processes on the system, which would be useful after the initial reconnaissance phase for planning further actions like exploitation or persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
