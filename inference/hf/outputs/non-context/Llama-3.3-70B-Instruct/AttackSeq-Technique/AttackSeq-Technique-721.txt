To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Rising Sun implant ensured persistence on the system and before it communicated with control servers, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an implant (Rising Sun) has already established persistence on a system by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder. This action ensures that the malware will be executed every time the system starts up. After establishing persistence, the next logical steps for the malware could involve setting up or preparing for command and control (C2) communication, which is hinted at by the mention of communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) here involves:
   - Establishing persistence.
   - The technique in question (which we are trying to identify).
   - Communicating with control servers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary discovering if there is an internet connection available. While this could be a step in the process of establishing C2 communication, it's more about verifying connectivity rather than a direct precursor to communicating with control servers.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. Given that the malware has established persistence and is preparing to communicate with its control servers, using a command and scripting interpreter could be a plausible step to execute further commands or scripts as part of its operation, potentially in preparation for or as part of C2 communication.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique is about discovering the system's network configuration. While useful for an adversary, it's not directly related to the act of communicating with control servers.
   - **D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves poisoning the LLMNR or NBT-NS cache to redirect traffic to an adversary-controlled system. This is more related to lateral movement within a network rather than a direct step in establishing C2 communication after persistence has been achieved.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Rising Sun implant has ensured persistence, indicating it has a foothold on the system.
   - The next step involves preparing for or facilitating communication with control servers.
   - Among the given options, using a **command and scripting interpreter (T1059)** seems most directly related to executing commands that could be necessary for establishing or maintaining communication with control servers, or for executing further malicious actions as directed by the C2 servers.

**Final Answer: B**
