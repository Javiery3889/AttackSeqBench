To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has ensured the integrity of a malicious payload using a sha256 checksum and has bypassed detection by using an encrypted shellcode. The goal is to load a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) and execute the decrypted payload.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Ensuring payload integrity (not directly related to an ATT&CK technique but indicates careful planning).
   - Bypassing detection with encrypted shellcode, which relates to evading security measures.
   - Loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload, which is the key action to identify the relevant ATT&CK technique.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying a container to execute malicious code. While containers can be used for various malicious purposes, the specific action of loading a DLL and executing a decrypted payload doesn't directly align with deploying a container.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system and execute malicious code. Loading a DLL and executing a payload can be achieved through native API calls, making this a plausible choice.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is about communicating with a command and control server or other machines in a way that evades detection. While encryption is mentioned in the question, the focus is on loading and executing a payload, not establishing a communication channel.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: Hiding artifacts is about concealing files, entries, or other objects to evade detection. While hiding artifacts might be part of the attack, the specific action of loading a DLL to execute a payload is more directly related to code execution techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already bypassed detection, indicating a focus on executing the malicious payload.
   - Loading a DLL is a common method for executing code within a process, and using native APIs can facilitate this action.
   - The question specifically mentions executing the decrypted payload, which aligns with using native APIs to load and execute code.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique for loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload is using native APIs.

Final Answer: B
