To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Elise malware initiated ipaddress.com queries, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the Elise malware querying ipaddress.com to obtain WAN IP addresses. This action suggests that the malware is attempting to gather information about the system's network configuration, specifically its external IP address. This is a step in the reconnaissance phase, where the attacker (or malware) is trying to understand the target environment better.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique described involves gathering system network configuration details, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase of an attack. The specific action of querying for WAN IP addresses falls under discovering system network configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1087.003-Email Account**: This involves creating or modifying email accounts, which doesn't directly relate to the action of gathering system network configuration details.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet. While it could be a subsequent step in an attack, it doesn't directly follow from gathering WAN IP addresses.
   - **C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**: This technique involves targeting specific individuals within an organization with spearphishing emails. It doesn't directly relate to the technical action of gathering network configuration details.
   - **D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's network configuration, which aligns with the action described in the question. Discovering WAN IP addresses is part of understanding the system's network setup.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Elise malware's action of querying ipaddress.com for WAN IP addresses indicates an interest in the system's network configuration.
   - This action is part of the reconnaissance phase, aimed at understanding the target environment.
   - Among the provided options, **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** is the technique that most closely matches the described action. It involves gathering information about the network configuration, which includes discovering IP addresses.

**Final Answer: D**
