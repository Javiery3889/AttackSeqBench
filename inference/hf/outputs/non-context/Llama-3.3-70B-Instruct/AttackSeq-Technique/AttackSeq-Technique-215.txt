To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the initial access achieved through aviation-related spear-phishing emails, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The initial access was achieved through aviation-related spear-phishing emails. This indicates that the attackers used targeted phishing emails to gain access to the system or network.

2. **Establishing Contact with C2 Server**: After the initial access, the attackers used Elirks malware to establish contact with a Command and Control (C2) server. The malware accessed pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services. This step involves communicating with the C2 server, likely to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

Given this context, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**: This technique involves obtaining authentication to a domain controller, which doesn't directly follow the scenario of establishing contact with a C2 server through encoded addresses on social media.

- **B: T1087.003-Email Account**: This technique involves using an email account as a means of communication with the C2 server. While email was used for initial access, the question asks for the technique that follows, which involves communication through encoded addresses on social media, not email accounts directly.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for C2 communication. Given that the malware accesses pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services (which are web-based), this technique aligns closely with the described scenario. It's plausible that after initial access, the malware would use web services (like social media platforms) to communicate with the C2 server.

- **D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**: This technique involves generating domains for C2 communication. While related to C2 communication, the question specifies the use of pre-determined encoded addresses on social media, not the generation of domains.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access method: Spear-phishing emails.
2. Understand the method used to establish C2 communication: Through encoded addresses on social media using Elirks malware.
3. Evaluate each answer choice against the scenario described.

**Final Answer**: C
