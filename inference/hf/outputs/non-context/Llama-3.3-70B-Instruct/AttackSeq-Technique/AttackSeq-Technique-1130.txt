To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of MS Office documents using CVE-2014-1761 for initial access. This suggests the attacker is using a vulnerability in MS Office to gain access to a system.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique would most likely occur next to allow the BlackEnergy malware to bypass standard detection methods.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**: This technique involves using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access a system. While RDP can be used post-exploitation, it doesn't directly relate to bypassing detection methods for malware like BlackEnergy.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making files or data difficult to detect by standard security tools. Given that the goal is to bypass standard detection methods for the BlackEnergy malware, obfuscation would be a plausible next step.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container**: Deploying a container is more related to setting up an environment for an application to run in isolation. While containers can be used for various purposes, they are not typically associated with bypassing detection of malware.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used for initial access, typically involving tricking a user into revealing sensitive information or executing malicious code. Since the question mentions initial access has already been achieved via CVE-2014-1761, phishing would not be the next logical step in this sequence.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question outlines an initial access vector via exploitation of a vulnerability.
   - The goal is to bypass standard detection methods for the BlackEnergy malware.
   - Among the provided options, **obfuscation** is a technique directly related to evading detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence, given the context, is to obfuscate files or information to avoid detection.

Final Answer: B
