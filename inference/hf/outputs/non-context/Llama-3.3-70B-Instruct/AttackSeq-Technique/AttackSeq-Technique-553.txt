To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario from Operation Pawn Storm, where attackers used multistage downloaders to establish execution and set up legitimate-looking phishing websites to harvest credentials. Specifically, it mentions the use of fake OWA (Outlook Web Access) log-in pages to capture credentials by logging victim input.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Establishing execution (likely through a downloader or some form of initial access).
   - Redirecting targets to phishing websites that mimic legitimate services (in this case, OWA log-in pages).
   - Capturing credentials through these fake log-in pages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves modifying or mimicking the protocol of an application to hide or obscure communication. While it could be related to the communication between the phishing site and the attacker's infrastructure, it doesn't directly relate to capturing credentials through logging victim input.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which can include logging keystrokes, clipboard content, or other input methods. Given the context of capturing credentials by logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages, this seems highly relevant.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**: This sub-technique involves using symmetric encryption for data protection. While cryptography might be used in the broader context of protecting stolen data or communications, it doesn't directly relate to the act of capturing credentials through fake log-in pages.
   - **D: T1110.003-Password Spraying**: This sub-technique involves attempting a list of commonly used passwords against multiple accounts to gain access. While related to credential compromise, it doesn't involve capturing credentials through logging input on fake log-in pages.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions capturing credentials by logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for capturing user input, such as login credentials, is Input Capture.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely captured credentials in the described scenario is Input Capture.

Final Answer: B
