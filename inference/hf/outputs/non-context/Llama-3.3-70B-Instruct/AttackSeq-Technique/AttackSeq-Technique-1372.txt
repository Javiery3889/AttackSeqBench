To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with the theft of personal contact information via social media mobile apps. This is part of the reconnaissance phase, which involves gathering information about the target. The sequence then involves leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials by mimicking legitimate password recovery or reset emails. This indicates a phishing campaign aimed at credential harvesting.

2. **Identifying Relevant ATT&CK Techniques**:
   - **Reconnaissance**: The initial step involves gathering personal contact information, which aligns with the reconnaissance tactic.
   - **Credential Harvesting**: The use of HTTPS landing pages to mimic legitimate password recovery or reset emails is a method of credential harvesting, which falls under the "Credential Access" tactic in the ATT&CK framework.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.002-AppleScript**: This technique involves using AppleScript for persistence or execution. It doesn't directly relate to the initial reconnaissance or the credential harvesting via phishing described.
   - **B: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**: This technique is about creating a silver ticket for use in Kerberos authentication, which is more related to lateral movement and privilege escalation rather than the initial stages of reconnaissance or phishing.
   - **C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: While this does involve gathering information, it's more focused on network information rather than personal contact information or the specific act of credential harvesting through phishing.
   - **D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves creating forged web credentials, which could be a step in the process of leveraging stolen personal information to create convincing phishing emails or landing pages aimed at harvesting credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack starts with reconnaissance to gather personal contact information.
   - The next logical step in the sequence provided would be to use this information to create targeted phishing campaigns.
   - Forging web credentials (or more broadly, creating fake web content) could be a part of this process, especially if the attackers aim to mimic legitimate services to trick victims into revealing their credentials.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of the question, which involves using personal contact information for targeted phishing to harvest credentials, the most relevant technique that likely occurred before leveraging HTTPS landing pages for credential harvesting would be related to preparing or setting up the phishing campaign. Among the provided options, **D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials** is the most closely related to the preparation and execution of a phishing campaign aimed at credential harvesting, as it involves creating fake or forged credentials which could be used in the context of mimicking legitimate password recovery or reset processes.

**Final Answer: D**
