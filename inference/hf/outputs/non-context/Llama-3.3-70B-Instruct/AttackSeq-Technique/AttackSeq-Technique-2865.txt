To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique used by Suckfly during its attempt to move laterally within the e-commerce company's internal network, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after scanning the corporate internal network for open ports to expand its foothold, Suckfly attempted to move laterally within the network. This implies that the initial access has been gained, and the adversary is now trying to navigate through the network, possibly to find valuable data or to escalate privileges.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Scanning for open ports (which could be related to techniques like T1595 - Active Scanning, though not directly listed as an option).
   - Moving laterally within the network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking a legitimate user's session to gain access to a system or network. While it could be used for lateral movement, it specifically involves taking over existing sessions, which isn't directly implied by the initial scanning and lateral movement described.
   
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access or control. Given that Suckfly scanned for open ports, exploiting a vulnerability in a service listening on one of those ports is a plausible next step for lateral movement.
   
   - **C: T1558.003-Kerberoasting**: This is a specific technique used for credential access, involving obtaining and cracking Kerberos tickets. While it could be part of a broader campaign for lateral movement, it's more focused on credential access rather than the direct exploitation of network services for movement.
   
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet. Since the question specifies movement within the internal network after initial scanning, exploiting public-facing applications seems less relevant to the lateral movement phase described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario describes an adversary that has already gained some level of access and is now looking to expand its presence within the network.
   - Scanning for open ports suggests the adversary is looking for vulnerable services to exploit.
   - Lateral movement within a network often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in services that are accessible from within the network.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the information provided and the analysis of the techniques, **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** is the most likely technique used for lateral movement after scanning for open ports, as it directly relates to exploiting services that could be found open during such a scan.

Final Answer: B
