To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where the Aurora malware has already achieved persistence by installing itself as a service and modifying registry keys.
   - It specifically asks about the technique used to evade detection by modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. Modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL is a form of hiding artifacts, as it makes the malicious DLL appear as if it has been part of the system for a longer time, thus potentially avoiding suspicion.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This is a technique where a process is created in a suspended state, and its memory is replaced with malicious code. While it's a method to evade detection, it doesn't directly relate to modifying file timestamps.
   - **T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to hide malicious activity. Although the question mentions the malware installing itself as a service, the specific action of modifying a DLL's file-time to evade detection doesn't directly fall under using system services.
   - **T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves making data difficult to understand. While modifying a file's timestamp could be seen as a form of obfuscation, in the context of the ATT&CK framework and the specific action described, it's more closely related to hiding artifacts than data obfuscation.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL to evade detection.
   - This action is most closely related to hiding artifacts, as it's intended to make the malicious DLL blend in with legitimate system files.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique for this action is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

Final Answer: A
