To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Lazarus group using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) for communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server to execute tasks. This indicates the group has already gained access to the target system and is in the phase of executing their objectives, which includes disrupting the bank's operations during the FEIB heist.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The use of backdoor malware for C&C communication suggests techniques related to establishing and maintaining a foothold in the target network, such as T1071-Application Window Discovery, T1082-System Information Discovery, and potentially T1204-User Execution for initial access. However, the question specifically asks for the final step to disrupt operations.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands on a remote system through an intermediary. While it could be part of the attack chain, it doesn't directly imply disruption of operations as a final step.
   - **B: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**: This involves using Regsvcs or Regasm to execute code, which could be part of establishing persistence or executing malicious code but doesn't directly relate to disrupting operations.
   - **C: T1485.001-Lifecycle-Triggered Deletion**: This technique involves deleting data or files based on specific conditions, which could be part of data manipulation or disruption but is less directly associated with the immediate disruption of operations through encryption or other means.
   - **D: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to disrupt access to it, which directly aligns with disrupting operations, especially in the context of a heist where financial data and systems are targeted.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Lazarus group's objective is to disrupt the bank's operations.
   - Using backdoor malware for C&C communication indicates they have access and are executing tasks.
   - The final step to disrupt operations would likely involve making critical data or systems unusable.
   - Encrypting data (T1486) directly achieves this by denying access to necessary information, fitting the goal of disrupting operations during a heist.

**Final Answer: D**
