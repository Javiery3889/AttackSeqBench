To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a Pierogi backdoor has achieved persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder. This action implies that the malware has already gained some level of access to the system and is ensuring it can survive restarts. The next step in the attack sequence involves collecting information about the infected machine, such as the computer name and antivirus details.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The initial step mentioned is achieving persistence, which is a tactic to maintain access to the compromised system.
   - The next action is collecting information, which falls under the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred between these two steps.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1587.004-Exploits**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain access or escalate privileges. While exploitation could be part of the initial infection vector, it doesn't directly fit between achieving persistence and collecting information in this context.
   - **B: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging**: This technique involves modifying or disabling logging features to hide malicious activity. It could be relevant after achieving persistence to cover tracks but doesn't directly relate to preparing for information collection.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves disabling or modifying security defenses to make the system more vulnerable. Achieving persistence and then impairing defenses could logically precede information collection, as it would make the system more susceptible to further exploitation and reduce the likelihood of detection during the information-gathering phase.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing malicious code. While user execution could be an initial infection vector, it doesn't logically fit between achieving persistence and collecting information in the described sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Pierogi backdoor has already achieved persistence, indicating the malware has access and is set to survive system restarts.
   - Before collecting sensitive information, the attacker would likely want to ensure they can operate as freely as possible without detection.
   - Impairing defenses (option C) would be a logical step to take after achieving persistence and before engaging in potentially noisy activities like information collection, as it would reduce the system's ability to detect and respond to the malware's activities.

**Final Answer: C**
