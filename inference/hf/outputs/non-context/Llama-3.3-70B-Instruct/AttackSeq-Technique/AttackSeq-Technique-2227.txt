To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Earth Lusca used tools for scanning and before they transferred tools and established network tunnels for Lateral Movement, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan to scan for NetBIOS name information and shared folders. This action is part of the Discovery phase, where attackers gather information about the target network and systems. The use of these tools indicates an effort to identify potential targets, open ports, and shared resources.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with Discovery (scanning for NetBIOS and shared folders), followed by an unknown technique, and then Lateral Movement (transferring tools and establishing network tunnels).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly follow the discovery of network services and shared folders in a straightforward manner without additional context.
   - **B: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves scanning for open ports and services on a network. Given that Earth Lusca has already used tools for scanning, this could potentially be part of their actions but seems more aligned with what they've already done rather than a distinct next step.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the software running on a system or network. After discovering open ports and shared folders, identifying specific software versions could be a logical next step to plan further exploitation, especially before transferring tools and establishing tunnels for lateral movement.
   - **D: T1036.007-Double File Extension**: This technique involves using files with double extensions to disguise malicious files. While useful for evasion, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of discovering network services and planning lateral movement without more specific context on file usage.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already performed initial discovery using network scanning tools.
   - The next logical step before moving laterally would be to gather more specific information about the systems they plan to target, such as the software running on them.
   - This information would be crucial for selecting the right tools to transfer and for planning how to establish network tunnels effectively without being detected.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the sequence of actions and the need for detailed system information before lateral movement, **C: T1518-Software Discovery** is the most plausible next step. It aligns with the attackers' need to understand the target environment better before proceeding with tool transfer and tunnel establishment.

Final Answer: C
