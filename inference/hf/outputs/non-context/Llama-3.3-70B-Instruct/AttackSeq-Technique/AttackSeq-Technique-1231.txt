To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the initial access and before establishing persistence, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers exploited CVE-2017-11882. This is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows remote code execution. The exploitation of this vulnerability for initial access aligns with **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**, but since this is the method of initial access, we're looking for what happened after this point.

2. **Establishing Persistence**: The attackers used a Run key and the `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` file. This indicates that after gaining initial access, they likely executed scripts to set up persistence. The use of a PowerShell script (`log.ps1`) suggests the utilization of scripting interpreters.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This is the technique used for initial access, not what happened afterward.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. Given that the attackers used a PowerShell script (`log.ps1`) for persistence, it's plausible that they used PowerShell (a scripting interpreter) after gaining initial access to execute commands or scripts that led to establishing persistence.
- **C: T1059.005-Visual Basic**: While this is a subset of scripting interpreters, the information provided points more directly to the use of PowerShell rather than Visual Basic.
- **D: T1218.014-MMC**: This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for persistence, which doesn't directly align with the use of a Run key and a PowerShell script for establishing persistence.

Based on the information provided and the techniques described, the most plausible sequence of events after initial access via CVE-2017-11882 and before establishing persistence using a Run key and a PowerShell script would involve the execution of scripts, which aligns with using a scripting interpreter.

Final Answer: B
