To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred when KerrDown established communication to download its payload, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Infection Vector**: The attack starts with the execution of macros from a malicious Office document. This is a common initial access technique (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment) but is not directly relevant to the question about establishing communication.

2. **Evading Defenses**: The use of in-memory payload decryption indicates an attempt to evade detection by security tools, which aligns with defense evasion techniques. However, the specific technique of in-memory payload decryption is more closely related to how the payload is handled post-exploitation rather than the communication method used to download the payload.

3. **Establishing Communication**: The key part of the question revolves around KerrDown establishing communication to download its payload. This implies a Command and Control (C2) channel is being set up.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices in the context of establishing communication for downloading a payload:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. Many malware families use standard application layer protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.) to blend in with normal network traffic, making it a plausible choice for establishing communication to download a payload.

- **B: T1102-Web Service**: While web services can be used for C2 communication, this option is more specific to using web services as a means of communication, which might not be the most direct or common method for downloading a payload compared to using standard application layer protocols.

- **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique is related to the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which could be relevant to the payload itself but does not directly relate to the establishment of communication for downloading the payload.

- **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**: This technique is related to gathering information about the physical location of the compromised system, which does not directly relate to the action of establishing communication for payload download.

Based on the analysis, the most relevant technique to the action of establishing communication to download a payload, especially in the context of using a potentially covert channel that could involve common internet protocols, is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique is directly related to using standard protocols for C2 communication, which would be necessary for downloading a payload.

Final Answer: A
