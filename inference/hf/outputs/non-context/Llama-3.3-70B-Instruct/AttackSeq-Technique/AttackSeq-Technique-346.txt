To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Initial Access through Supply Chain Compromise**: The attack begins with a supply chain compromise, where the threat actors gain initial access to the system through a compromised software update. This is a sophisticated method that allows attackers to bypass traditional security controls by embedding malicious code or backdoors into software updates.

2. **Executing Code using System Services**: After gaining initial access, the threat actors execute code using system services. This implies that the attackers are leveraging existing system services or functionalities to run their malicious code, which is a common tactic to maintain persistence and evade detection.

Given this context, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary attempting to get a list of running processes to understand the system's environment. While process discovery could be a part of the attacker's reconnaissance efforts, it doesn't directly relate to executing code using system services.

- **B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence**: This sub-technique is about removing indicators of persistence that could be left behind by an adversary. It doesn't align with the action of executing code through system services.

- **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: This sub-technique involves using AutoHotKey or AutoIT for executing malicious code. While it does involve code execution, it's more specific to using these particular tools and doesn't directly relate to leveraging system services for code execution.

- **D: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to execute malicious code, which directly aligns with the described action of executing code using system services after gaining initial access.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access method: Supply Chain Compromise.
2. Understand the action taken after initial access: Executing code using system services.
3. Evaluate each answer choice against the described action.
4. Select the answer choice that best matches the execution of code through system services.

**Final Answer**: D
