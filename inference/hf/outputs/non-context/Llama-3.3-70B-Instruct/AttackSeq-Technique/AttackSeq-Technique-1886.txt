To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions staging data collected from network shared drives and archiving it with specific utilities. This implies that an attacker has already gained access to the network, collected data, and is now looking to transfer tools and communicate within the network without being detected.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key actions here are "staging data," "archiving it," and the need to "enable the transfer of tools and communication within the network." The first two actions suggest data collection and preparation for exfiltration or further analysis. The third action implies the need for a method to move tools and communicate within the network, possibly to expand access, maintain persistence, or prepare for further data exfiltration.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to mask the source of traffic. While it could be used for communication, it's more about hiding the origin of the traffic rather than enabling the transfer of tools within the network.
   - **B: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**: This technique is related to loading dynamic libraries in macOS environments to execute malicious code. It's more specific to code execution rather than the general transfer of tools and communication.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to interact with a compromised system, which could include transferring tools and communicating within the network. It aligns well with the need to enable the transfer of tools and communication.
   - **D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding infrastructure used for malicious activities, which is more related to evading detection rather than enabling tool transfer and communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already collected and archived data, indicating a need for further interaction with the compromised network.
   - The goal is to enable the transfer of tools and communication, suggesting a need for a technique that facilitates interaction with the compromised system.
   - Among the options, **T1021-Remote Services** directly addresses the need to interact with a system remotely, which can include transferring tools and maintaining communication.

**Final Answer: C**
