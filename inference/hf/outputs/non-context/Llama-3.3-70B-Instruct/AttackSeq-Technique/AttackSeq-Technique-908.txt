To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses software bundlers to drop an installer and employs obfuscated batch scripts to evade defenses. After these actions, the malware Dexphot uses process hollowing to execute malicious code within legitimate system processes. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the process hollowing.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The initial steps involve using software bundlers and obfuscated batch scripts.
   - The final step mentioned is process hollowing (a technique where a legitimate process is spawned, and then its memory is replaced with malicious code).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. While hiding artifacts could be a part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the actions immediately before process hollowing.
   - **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**: This involves hijacking COM (Component Object Model) objects to execute malicious code. It's a specific technique that might not directly precede process hollowing in a typical attack sequence.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. Process hollowing often involves using native APIs to manipulate processes and memory, making this a plausible step before executing process hollowing.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. While the use of obfuscated batch scripts is mentioned, this choice is more about the execution of scripts rather than the direct precursor to process hollowing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of software bundlers and obfuscated batch scripts suggests an initial phase of establishing a foothold and evading detection.
   - Process hollowing is a technique used to execute malicious code within a legitimate process, which requires interacting with system processes and potentially manipulating memory.
   - Among the given choices, using **Native API (T1106)** is the most directly related technique that would precede process hollowing, as it involves interacting with the operating system at a low level, which is necessary for manipulating processes and memory.

**Final Answer: C**
