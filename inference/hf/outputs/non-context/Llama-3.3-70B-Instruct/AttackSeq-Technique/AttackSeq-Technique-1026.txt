To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions a sequence of actions where an attacker, after taking screenshots every minute using a backdoor, uploads harvested sensitive data from removable drives to a Command and Control (C&C) server. The key elements here are:
   - The use of a backdoor for taking screenshots.
   - The harvesting of sensitive data from removable drives.
   - The upload of this data to a C&C server.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The question directly mentions the upload of data to a C&C server, which implies data exfiltration. Before this upload, the attacker must have accessed and collected (harvested) the sensitive data from removable media.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**: This technique involves reducing the key space to make a brute force attack more feasible. It doesn't directly relate to the sequence of taking screenshots, harvesting data from removable drives, and uploading it to a C&C server.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel. While this is relevant to uploading data to a C&C server, the question asks for the technique that occurred before the upload.
   - **C: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing input from web portals, which doesn't directly relate to the actions described in the question.
   - **D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media, which directly precedes the action of uploading harvested sensitive data to a C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker uses a backdoor to establish access and take screenshots, indicating they are already inside the system.
   - The next logical step before uploading data to a C&C server would be to collect or harvest the data of interest.
   - Collecting data from removable media (T1025) fits as the action that occurs before the data is uploaded to the C&C server, especially since the question specifies that sensitive data from removable drives was harvested.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the sequence of events and the techniques described, the most plausible technique that occurred before the data was uploaded to the C&C server is collecting data from removable media.

Final Answer: D
