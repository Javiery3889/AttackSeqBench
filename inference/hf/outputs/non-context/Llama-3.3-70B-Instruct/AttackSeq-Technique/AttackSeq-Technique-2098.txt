To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the exploitation of RTF (Rich Text Format) files using vulnerabilities like CVE-2014-1761 to gain initial access. This indicates the attacker has already established a foothold within the target environment. The question then asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated communication with the attackers' cloud-based infrastructure for command-and-control (C2) operations.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial access was gained through exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files, which aligns with techniques under "Initial Access" in the ATT&CK framework, such as T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment. However, the question focuses on the subsequent action of establishing communication for C2 operations.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communications. It's a plausible choice because attackers often use existing protocols (like HTTP, DNS, etc.) to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect C2 communications.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used for initial access, not for C2 communication. This choice doesn't align with the question's focus on post-exploitation C2 communication.
   - **C: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique is about exfiltrating data, not establishing C2 communications. While data exfiltration might occur during an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the question's focus on C2 communication.
   - **D: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This sub-technique under "Web Service" involves using web services for bidirectional communication, which could be used for C2. However, the broader category of T1102 (Web Service) is more specific to using web services, which might not encompass all types of C2 communication, especially when considering the use of various application layer protocols.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that facilitates C2 communication after initial access has been gained.
   - The focus is on communication with cloud-based infrastructure, which implies the need for a technique that can handle network communication.
   - Among the options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most directly related to C2 communication, as it involves using protocols that can be used for command and control, such as HTTP, FTP, or custom protocols, which can be used to communicate with cloud-based infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A**
