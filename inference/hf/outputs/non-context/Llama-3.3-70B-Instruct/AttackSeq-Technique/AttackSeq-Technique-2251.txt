To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where SideCopy, presumably a threat actor or group, uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases. This implies an interest in obtaining credentials or sensitive information. The question then asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used during credential harvesting, specifically targeting access credentials through tools like keyloggers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Exfiltration of authentication databases (implying an interest in credentials).
   - Credential harvesting.
   - Use of tools like keyloggers for targeting access credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1558.002-Silver Ticket**: This involves creating a ticket that can be used to access a system without needing the user's password. While it's a credential harvesting technique, it doesn't directly involve keyloggers.
   - **T1584.002-DNS Server**: This technique involves using a DNS server to carry out Command and Control (C2) communications. It doesn't directly relate to credential harvesting through keyloggers.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used to trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords. While it's a method of credential harvesting, it doesn't specifically involve keyloggers.
   - **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which can be achieved through keyloggers. It directly aligns with the use of tools like keyloggers for credential harvesting.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies the use of tools like keyloggers for credential harvesting.
   - Keyloggers are used to capture user input, such as passwords.
   - T1056-Input Capture is the ATT&CK technique that directly involves capturing user input, which matches the description of using keyloggers.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the information provided and the focus on keyloggers for credential harvesting, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique is T1056-Input Capture.

Final Answer: D
