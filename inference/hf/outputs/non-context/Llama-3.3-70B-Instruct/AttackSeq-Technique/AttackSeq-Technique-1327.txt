To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker, utilizing the CosmicDuke malware, has already used Discovery techniques to identify targeted files. 
   - The specific action in question involves gathering information from removable drives while skipping certain file types.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial step involves Discovery, which is about identifying and understanding the environment and potential targets within it.
   - The action described (gathering information from removable drives) suggests a technique focused on collecting data from external storage devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1127.002-ClickOnce**: This technique involves using ClickOnce, a Microsoft technology for deploying applications, for malicious purposes. It doesn't directly relate to gathering data from removable media.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**: This involves intercepting and manipulating credential API calls to steal credentials. It's not directly related to collecting data from removable drives.
   - **C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**: This technique is about obtaining or creating fake authentication certificates, which doesn't match the action of gathering data from removable media.
   - **D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, which aligns with the described action of gathering information from removable drives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions the action of gathering information from removable drives, which directly corresponds to collecting data from external storage devices.
   - Among the provided options, only **T1025-Data from Removable Media** directly relates to this action.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described involves collecting data from removable media.

Final Answer: D
