To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins for exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases. This implies an initial access and execution phase where attackers have gained access to the system and are using specific tools (in this case, written in GoLang) to gather sensitive information.
   - It also mentions performing discovery to lure victims with decoy documents and cloned websites, which suggests a social engineering or phishing tactic to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or gaining access to their systems.
   - The question specifically asks about the technique most likely used as SideCopy harvested access credentials from central Indian government employees.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**:
   - Initial Access: Gaining access to the system, possibly through social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - Execution: Using GoLang-based tools for reconnaissance and exfiltration of authentication databases.
   - Credential Access: The focus of the question, where SideCopy is involved in harvesting access credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This involves capturing keystrokes to obtain credentials. While possible, the question does not directly imply keylogging as the method used by SideCopy to harvest credentials.
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which could include databases or files containing passwords. Given the mention of exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases, this seems like a plausible method for obtaining credentials.
   - **C: T1110.001-Password Guessing**: This technique involves attempting to guess passwords, often through brute force. The question does not suggest that SideCopy is guessing passwords but rather is harvesting them, implying a more direct method of credential acquisition.
   - **D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique is about gathering information about the victim organization, which, while relevant to the initial phases of an attack, does not directly relate to the harvesting of access credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question implies a direct method of credential harvesting, likely facilitated by the exfiltration of authentication databases.
   - SideCopy's involvement suggests a focused effort on obtaining credentials, possibly leveraging the exfiltrated databases or other compromised information.
   - Given the context, the most direct method of obtaining credentials from compromised systems or databases would be through accessing password stores or similar repositories of credential information.

**Final Answer: B**
