To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD, which are used for destructive actions. It also mentions the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for communication with Command and Control (C2) servers over HTTP. This indicates a phase of the attack where the adversary is likely establishing persistence, communicating with C2 servers, and possibly preparing for further malicious activities.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with the deployment of destructive malware (wipers), followed by the use of a backdoor ('IPsec Helper') for C2 communication. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this communication was established.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**: This technique involves using Regsvcs and Regasm for execution. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the actions typically following C2 communication establishment in the context provided.
   - **B: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood**: This technique is about overwhelming a service with requests to degrade its performance. It doesn't directly follow the use of a backdoor for C2 communication in a logical sequence aimed at further malicious actions like data manipulation or exfiltration.
   - **C: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to disrupt the availability or integrity of the data. Given the context of using wipers and a backdoor, encrypting data could be a plausible next step for causing further impact, especially if the goal is disruption or ransom.
   - **D: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to conduct a variety of actions. While it could be relevant in many attack sequences, it's more about the method of accessing a system rather than a specific action taken after establishing C2 communication for further impact.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of wipers indicates a destructive intent.
   - The establishment of C2 communication via a backdoor suggests the adversary is looking to issue commands or receive data.
   - Given the destructive nature of the initial actions and the establishment of a communication channel, the next logical step would be to cause further disruption or impact.
   - Encrypting data for impact (T1486) aligns with causing further disruption and is a technique that could logically follow the establishment of C2 communication, especially in the context of using destructive malware.

**Final Answer: C**
