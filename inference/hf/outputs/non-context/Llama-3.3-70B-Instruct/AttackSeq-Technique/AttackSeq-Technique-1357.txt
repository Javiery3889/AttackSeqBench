To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the use of obfuscated JavaScript injection for evasion and persistence, and it asks about the technique that facilitated communication between the Pupy backdoor and the command and control (C2) server. The key elements here are the use of a backdoor (Pupy) and the need for communication with a C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves initial infection or access (not specified), followed by the use of obfuscated JavaScript for evasion and persistence, and then the establishment of communication between the backdoor and the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This technique involves using file transfer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. While it's a method for transferring files, it's not the most direct method for facilitating command and control communications.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a supply chain to gain access to a target. It doesn't directly relate to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) for C2 communication. Given that the Pupy backdoor needs to communicate with its C2 server, using an application layer protocol is a common and effective method for this purpose, especially since it can blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **D: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**: This technique is related to hijacking dynamic libraries on macOS systems to load malicious code. It doesn't directly relate to facilitating communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the communication method used by the Pupy backdoor to interact with its C2 server.
   - The use of obfuscated JavaScript suggests an attempt to evade detection, which implies the attackers would prefer methods that blend in with normal traffic.
   - Application layer protocols (like HTTP, which is commonly used for web traffic) are frequently used for C2 communications because they can easily masquerade as legitimate traffic, reducing the likelihood of detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique for facilitating this communication, given the context, is the use of an application layer protocol.

**Final Answer: C**
