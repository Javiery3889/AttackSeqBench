To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the initial access and the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files by Shuckworm to maintain their presence, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The use of a malicious document with a custom Pterodo backdoor indicates the initial compromise vector. This is typically associated with techniques like T1193 (Spearphishing Attachment) or T1204 (User Execution), but the question focuses on post-compromise activities.

2. **Execution of VBS scripts and HTA files**: This action suggests that the adversary is using scripting to execute their malicious code. VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) and HTA (HTML Application) files can be used for various purposes, including executing system commands, downloading additional payloads, or establishing persistence.

Given this context, we need to evaluate which of the provided ATT&CK techniques is most likely to occur after the execution of these scripts for maintaining presence:

- **A: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique involves the theft of financial information, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining presence or the execution of scripts for persistence or further system compromise.

- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves achieving persistence by executing malicious code automatically at system boot or user logon. The execution of VBS scripts and HTA files could be a precursor to establishing a mechanism for autostart execution, making this a plausible next step for maintaining presence.

- **C: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) for code execution. While it's a method of executing code, it's more specific to exploiting the DDE protocol and might not be the most direct follow-up to executing VBS and HTA files for persistence.

- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task to execute a program or script at a specified time or interval. It's a common method for achieving persistence and could be a logical next step after initial execution of malicious scripts to ensure continued presence.

Considering the goal of maintaining presence and the actions described, both **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** and **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** seem like plausible next steps. However, given the context of executing scripts (VBS and HTA) which could be used to set up scheduled tasks for persistence, **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** appears to be a more direct and likely follow-up action for maintaining presence over time.

Final Answer: D
