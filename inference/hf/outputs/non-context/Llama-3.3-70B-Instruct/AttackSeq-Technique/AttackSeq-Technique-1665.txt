To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions BlueBravo's malware gathering victim system information and then establishing bidirectional communication with their Command and Control (C2) servers. The communication is specifically noted to be using the HTTPS protocol, encrypted with RC4, and Base64 encoding.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the use of HTTPS for C2 communication and the specific encryption and encoding methods (RC4 and Base64). This suggests we're looking for a technique related to communication with C2 servers, specifically one that involves the use of application layer protocols for this purpose.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This technique involves using multiple proxies to obscure the source of the traffic. While it could be part of a broader C2 strategy, it doesn't directly relate to the specifics of using HTTPS with RC4 and Base64 encoding for communication.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, etc.) for C2 communication. Given that the question specifies the use of HTTPS for bidirectional communication, this seems highly relevant. The use of RC4 and Base64 encoding for encryption and encoding, respectively, fits within the context of customizing or utilizing existing application layer protocols for secure communication.
   - **C: T1546.009-AppCert DLLs**: This technique involves using AppCert DLLs to proxy or intercept system calls related to code signing. While it's a method for manipulating system calls, it doesn't directly relate to the establishment of C2 communication using HTTPS.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While it could be used in conjunction with establishing C2 communication, it doesn't specifically address the use of HTTPS, RC4, and Base64 encoding for this purpose.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method of communication with C2 servers, specifically highlighting the use of HTTPS, RC4 encryption, and Base64 encoding.
   - Among the provided options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most directly related to using HTTPS for C2 communication.
   - The other options either relate to different aspects of C2 communication (like proxying or intercepting system calls) or to interacting with the operating system, which are not the primary focus of the question.

Final Answer: B
