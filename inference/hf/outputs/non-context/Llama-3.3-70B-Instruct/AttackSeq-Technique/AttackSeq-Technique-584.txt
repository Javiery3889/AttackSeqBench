To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained credential access using tools like Mimikatz and Impacket for pass-the-hash attacks. Following this, they utilized webshells to execute commands on other systems within the network and dumped credentials. The key elements here are the use of webshells for remote command execution and the dumping of credentials for lateral movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial step involves credential access (likely through T1003 - Credential Dumping, given the mention of Mimikatz, and T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material for pass-the-hash attacks). The subsequent action involves using webshells for command execution on other systems, which indicates a form of remote access or execution technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email from local email clients, which does not directly relate to the use of webshells or dumping credentials for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into running processes, which could be a part of the attack but doesn't directly align with the described use of webshells for remote command execution.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to execute commands, which aligns with the use of webshells to execute commands on other systems within the network. Webshells can be considered a form of remote service that allows attackers to interact with a compromised web application and execute system commands.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This sub-technique specifically involves using cloud services for remote execution, which does not directly match the scenario described, as there's no mention of cloud services being used.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers gained initial access and then used webshells to execute commands remotely.
   - The use of webshells for command execution on other systems within the network best matches the description of using remote services for execution.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique, given the context, is T1021-Remote Services, as it directly relates to the execution of commands on remote systems using webshells.

Final Answer: C
