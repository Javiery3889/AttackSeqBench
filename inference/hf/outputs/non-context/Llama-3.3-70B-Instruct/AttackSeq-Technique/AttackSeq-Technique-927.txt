To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after Volatile Cedar uses keylogging for credential access, the campaign connects with multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems. The key points here are:
   - **Initial Action**: Keylogging for credential access. This implies the attackers have gained access to the system and are looking to expand their control.
   - **Subsequent Action**: Connecting with multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems. This suggests the attackers are moving laterally within the network or establishing command and control (C2) channels.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with credential access (likely through keylogging, which aligns with T1056 - Keylogging, though not directly asked), followed by actions that would facilitate control over targeted systems.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. While it could be a method for initial access, it doesn't directly relate to controlling systems after credential access has been achieved.
   - **B: T1497.001-System Checks**: This involves checking system information, which could be part of the reconnaissance phase but doesn't directly relate to controlling targeted systems through multi-tiered server backend frameworks.
   - **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique is about making data more difficult to detect, which might be used at various stages of an attack but doesn't directly relate to establishing control over systems.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communications. Given that the attackers are connecting with multi-tiered server backend frameworks, this could be a plausible method for controlling targeted systems, as it would allow for communication between the compromised systems and the C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already gained credential access, indicating they are past the initial access phase.
   - They are now looking to control targeted systems, which suggests they need a method for command and control.
   - Among the given options, the one that best aligns with establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems through communication with a C2 server is using application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: D**
