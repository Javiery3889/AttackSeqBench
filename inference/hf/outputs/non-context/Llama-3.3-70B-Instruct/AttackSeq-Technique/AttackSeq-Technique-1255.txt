To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Packrat used AutoIt3Wrapper and other runtime packers, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - Packrat used AutoIt3Wrapper and other runtime packers to wrap their Remote Access Trojans (RATs). This action is aimed at evading detection by antivirus solutions, which suggests the attackers are trying to hide or obscure their malware.
   - The use of packers like AutoIt3Wrapper is a technique to obfuscate or protect the malware from being detected. This is closely related to the concept of making files or information obfuscated.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a portable executable file. While it's a method used for evasion and persistence, it doesn't directly relate to the use of packers for obfuscation.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a technique used for initial access, typically involving tricking a user into revealing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link. This doesn't directly follow the use of packers for evasion.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making files or information difficult to understand or detect, which aligns with the use of packers like AutoIt3Wrapper to evade antivirus detection.
   - **D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This involves using the Windows Command Shell for execution, which could be a step in the attack chain but doesn't directly relate to the action of using packers for obfuscation.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes the use of packers to avoid detection, which is a form of obfuscation.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique that aligns with this action is the one related to making files or information obfuscated.
   - Among the given choices, **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** is the technique that directly corresponds to the use of packers for evading detection.

**Final Answer: C**
