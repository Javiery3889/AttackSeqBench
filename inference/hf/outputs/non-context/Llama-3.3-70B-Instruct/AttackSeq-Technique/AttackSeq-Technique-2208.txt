To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Earth Lusca used scanning tools to discover machines in the compromised network and before they utilized tools to compress and exfiltrate collected data, let's analyze the sequence of actions and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - Earth Lusca used scanning tools (HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan) to discover machines in the compromised network. This action suggests an initial reconnaissance phase where the attackers are trying to understand the network layout and identify potential targets.
   - After discovering machines, the next logical step would involve interacting with these machines to gather more information or prepare them for further exploitation.
   - Before utilizing tools like WinRAR and megacmd for compression and exfiltration, the attackers would need to collect data from the local systems.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task or job to execute on a remote system. While it could be part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the action of collecting data from local systems after reconnaissance and before exfiltration.
   - **B: T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique is about archiving data using a utility, which aligns with the use of tools like WinRAR for compression but doesn't fit as the step immediately before compression and exfiltration since it's more about the method of archiving rather than collecting data.
   - **C: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**: Changing default file associations is not directly related to the sequence of discovering machines, collecting data, and then exfiltrating it.
   - **D: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from a local system, which perfectly fits the sequence. After discovering machines and before exfiltrating data, the attackers would need to collect the data they are interested in from those systems.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The attackers first used scanning tools to identify potential targets within the network.
   - The next logical step would be to interact with these targets to gather information or data, which aligns with collecting data from local systems.
   - The use of tools for compression and exfiltration comes after data collection.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after the initial scanning and before the compression and exfiltration is collecting data from local systems.

Final Answer: D
