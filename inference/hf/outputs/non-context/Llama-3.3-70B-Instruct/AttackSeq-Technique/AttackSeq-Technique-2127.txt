To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that attackers used scanning tools and stolen credentials for discovery. This implies an initial phase of reconnaissance and possibly initial access. The attackers then achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to target servers. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique likely occurred before this lateral movement.

2. **Identifying Key Elements**:
   - **Initial Access and Discovery**: Scanning tools and stolen credentials were used, which could align with techniques like T1110 (Brute Force) for gaining initial access or T1003 (OS Credential Dumping) for obtaining credentials, but these are not our focus.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Achieved by deploying RDP to target servers, which directly points towards using remote services for movement within the network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**: This involves collecting email from remote systems, which doesn't directly relate to the use of RDP for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts on a remote system. While it could be part of the attack chain, it's not the most direct precursor to using RDP for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to interact with systems, which aligns closely with the use of RDP for lateral movement. RDP is a type of remote service.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This is a sub-technique of T1021 focused on cloud services. While relevant in a cloud context, the question does not specify cloud services, making it less directly relevant.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers used scanning tools and stolen credentials, indicating they had some level of access and were looking to expand it.
   - The goal was to achieve lateral movement, which they did by deploying RDP.
   - RDP is a form of remote service, which suggests that the technique most closely related to this action would involve remote services.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the information and the focus on RDP for lateral movement, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve using remote services before achieving this movement.

Final Answer: C
