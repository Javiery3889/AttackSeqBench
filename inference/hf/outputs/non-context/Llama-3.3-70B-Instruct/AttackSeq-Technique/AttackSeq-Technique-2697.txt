To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Elfin ensured persistence, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Elfin, presumably an adversary group, has already established persistence on a compromised machine. This persistence is achieved by creating a scheduled task that executes a malicious VBE (Visual Basic Encoded) file multiple times a day. Additionally, PowerShell commands are used to bypass logging on the infected machine, which suggests an attempt to remain stealthy and avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described involves:
   - Establishing persistence through scheduled tasks.
   - Using PowerShell for logging evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerable systems or applications. While it could be a part of an adversary's tactics, it doesn't directly follow from establishing persistence and evading logging.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon. Although related to persistence, the question specifically mentions scheduled tasks, not boot or logon autostart execution.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute programs or scripts. Given that the question explicitly mentions creating a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file, this seems like a direct match.
   - **D: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising software supply chains, which does not directly relate to the actions described in the question (establishing persistence and evading logging through scheduled tasks and PowerShell).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question outlines a specific action (creating a scheduled task for a malicious VBE file) that aligns with establishing persistence.
   - The use of PowerShell for logging evasion suggests the adversary is taking steps to maintain access without being detected.
   - Among the provided choices, **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** directly corresponds with the action of creating a scheduled task for malicious execution, which is a method of achieving persistence.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the information provided and the analysis above, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after ensuring persistence through scheduled tasks is directly related to the use of scheduled tasks for malicious execution.

Final Answer: C
