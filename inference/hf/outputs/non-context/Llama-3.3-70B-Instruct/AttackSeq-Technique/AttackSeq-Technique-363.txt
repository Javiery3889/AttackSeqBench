To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after FIN8 used a script suspected to be Mimikatz for credential dumping but before conducting system fingerprinting, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: 
   - The question mentions the use of a script suspected to be Mimikatz (mimi.ps1) for reading the memory of lsass.exe. This action is associated with credential dumping, specifically aiming to extract credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process.
   - After this action, the attackers conducted system fingerprinting using commands like systeminfo.exe and tasklist.exe.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action is credential dumping, which aligns with **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**. This is because Mimikatz is a tool commonly used for this purpose.
   - The subsequent action involves system fingerprinting, which could involve several techniques but is not directly listed in the provided choices. However, system fingerprinting often precedes or follows actions that involve understanding the network or system layout.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1055.014-VDSO Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) to evade detection or intercept system calls. While it's a post-exploitation technique, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of credential dumping followed by system fingerprinting.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This is the technique used by the attackers with Mimikatz, so it's the action that has already occurred, not the one that happens afterward.
   - **C: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the network connections of a system, which could logically follow credential dumping as an attacker might use obtained credentials to explore the network or system further. It also precedes system fingerprinting as understanding network connections can inform what systems to fingerprint.
   - **D: T1555.001-Keychain**: This involves accessing keychain storage to obtain credentials. While related to credential access, it doesn't fit the sequence described as it's more about accessing stored credentials rather than a direct follow-up to dumping OS credentials and preceding system fingerprinting.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already performed credential dumping using Mimikatz.
   - The next logical step before conducting system fingerprinting (which involves gathering detailed information about the system) could involve understanding the system's network connections to identify potential targets for fingerprinting or to use the dumped credentials for lateral movement.
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** fits this sequence as it involves discovering network connections, which can be a precursor to system fingerprinting and utilizing the credentials obtained.

**Final Answer: C**
