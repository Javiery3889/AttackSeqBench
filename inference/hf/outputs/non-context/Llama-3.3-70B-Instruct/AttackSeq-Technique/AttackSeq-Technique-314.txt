To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where BitterAPT distributed malware through compromised websites and then communicated with compromised systems using multiple Command and Control (CnC) servers. The key detail here is the use of "multiple CnC servers" such as blitzchatlog.ddns.net and playupdateapp.serveblog.net. This implies a method of communication that allows for flexibility and potentially evasion of detection by dynamically changing or resolving the CnC server addresses.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up rules in email services to forward emails to other accounts, which doesn't directly relate to the communication between compromised systems and CnC servers.
   - **B & C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves using dynamic DNS or other methods to rapidly change the resolution of domains or IP addresses, making it harder to track and block CnC communications. Given that the question mentions the use of multiple CnC servers with dynamic domain name system (DDNS) services (indicated by ".ddns.net" and potentially ".serveblog.net"), this technique seems highly relevant.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. While phishing can be an initial vector for compromise, it doesn't directly relate to the communication between compromised systems and CnC servers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question focuses on the method used for communication between compromised systems and the attackers' CnC servers.
   - The use of multiple CnC servers, especially those with dynamic DNS services, suggests a need for flexibility and evasion techniques.
   - T1568-Dynamic Resolution directly addresses the use of dynamic methods to resolve or change the addresses of CnC servers, fitting the scenario described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using dynamic resolution to manage communications with compromised systems.

Final Answer: B
