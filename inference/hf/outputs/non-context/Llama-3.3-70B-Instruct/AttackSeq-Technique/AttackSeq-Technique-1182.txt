To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor has already been established on a victim's machine. This backdoor collects machine information and screenshots, which it then sends to a Command and Control (C&C) server. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs next to enable communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described involves:
   - Establishing a backdoor.
   - Collecting machine information and screenshots.
   - Sending the collected data to a C&C server.
   - The next step involves enabling communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to a network. While it could be part of an attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the act of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages after a backdoor has been established.
   - **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves collecting data from a network shared drive. It doesn't directly pertain to the communication between a backdoor and a C&C server or querying external services.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C&C server. It can include querying external services and could be used for transmitting encrypted messages, fitting the scenario described.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into a compromised system. While it's a method used in the attack sequence, it doesn't specifically relate to the act of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The scenario describes a backdoor that has already been established and is communicating with a C&C server.
   - The next logical step in the sequence involves maintaining communication, which would include querying external services and transmitting data, possibly encrypted, to the C&C server.
   - Among the given options, **T1102-Web Service** is the technique that most directly aligns with the act of enabling communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

Final Answer: C
