To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Grabit malware sends an HTTP request to a compromised remote server to download itself via a malicious macro. This indicates an initial infection vector, likely through phishing or some form of social engineering that led to the execution of the malicious macro. The focus is on what happens after the malware is downloaded and executed, specifically regarding maintaining persistence on the infected system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial step involves downloading the malware, which suggests techniques related to initial access and execution. However, the question specifically asks about maintaining persistence, which is a post-compromise tactic according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1008 - Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one is compromised or unavailable. While related to command and control (C2), it doesn't directly address persistence.
   - **B: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically when a system boots up or a user logs on, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - **C: T1546.011 - Application Shimming**: This involves intercepting API calls to alter the behavior of an application, which could be used for persistence but is more specific to modifying application behavior rather than ensuring the malware runs at startup or logon.
   - **D: T1546.001 - Change Default File Association**: This technique involves changing the default application associated with a file type to potentially execute malicious code. While it could be used for persistence, it's less direct compared to autostart execution techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already been downloaded and executed, indicating the initial access phase is complete.
   - The focus is on maintaining persistence, which means ensuring the malware continues to run on the system even after restarts or user logoffs.
   - Among the given options, **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** directly addresses how malware can maintain persistence by executing automatically at system boot or user logon, making it a common and effective technique for ensuring continued access to a compromised system.

**Final Answer: B**
