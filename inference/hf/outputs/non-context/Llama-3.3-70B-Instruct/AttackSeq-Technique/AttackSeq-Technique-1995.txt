To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after SkinnyBoy conducted discovery by enumerating files and directories and extracted system information, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question mentions that SkinnyBoy has already conducted discovery by:
     - Enumerating files and directories using APIs such as `FindFirstFileW`.
     - Extracting system information using functions like `GetComputerNameA`.
   - These actions are indicative of an adversary gathering information about the system and its environment, which is a common step in the early stages of an attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The techniques mentioned involve system and file discovery, which align with the ATT&CK technique **T1083 - File and Directory Discovery**. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **after** these actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This is what SkinnyBoy has already done, according to the question. It's about discovering files and directories, which doesn't fit as the next step after the described actions.
   - **B: T1059.005-Visual Basic** - This involves using Visual Basic for scripting, which could be a method used for various purposes, including executing malicious code or further discovery. However, it's not directly related to the discovery actions described.
   - **C: T1135-Network Share Discovery** - After discovering local system information and files, an adversary might proceed to discover network shares to expand their understanding of the network and potential targets. This could be a logical next step.
   - **D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication** - This technique involves interacting with other processes, which could be relevant at various stages of an attack but doesn't directly follow from the described discovery actions as a necessary next step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Given that SkinnyBoy has already performed local system and file discovery, the next logical step would involve expanding their scope to understand more about the network environment.
   - Discovering network shares (T1135) would provide valuable information about potential targets, shared resources, and paths for lateral movement, making it a plausible next step after initial system and file discovery.

**Final Answer: C**
