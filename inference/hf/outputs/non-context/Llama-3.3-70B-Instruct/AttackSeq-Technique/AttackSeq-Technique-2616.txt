To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where a Flash exploit ("flash_video_x86.swf") is delivered via spear-phishing email to execute arbitrary code.
   - The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique most likely used to maintain persistence on the victim's machine by leveraging elevated privileges after the initial exploitation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1221-Template Injection**: This technique involves injecting templates into a process to execute code. While it could be used for persistence, it's not the most direct method for maintaining persistence with elevated privileges after exploiting a vulnerability.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task to execute at a specific time or interval, which can be used to maintain persistence. It's plausible for maintaining persistence, especially if the attacker has gained sufficient privileges to schedule tasks.
   - **T1543.003-Windows Service**: This technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to execute malicious code, providing a means for persistence. It's a direct way to leverage elevated privileges for persistence.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial vector of attack (spear-phishing) mentioned in the question and not a method for maintaining persistence.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique used to maintain persistence after the initial exploitation, not the initial attack vector.
   - Between the options provided, **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** and **T1543.003-Windows Service** are both viable for maintaining persistence.
   - However, given the context of leveraging elevated privileges for persistence after executing arbitrary code, **T1543.003-Windows Service** is more directly related to achieving persistence with elevated privileges, as creating or modifying a Windows service typically requires and can provide system-level access.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is also a strong candidate but creating a Windows service might offer more flexibility and system integration for an attacker looking to maintain long-term persistence with elevated privileges.

Final Answer: C
