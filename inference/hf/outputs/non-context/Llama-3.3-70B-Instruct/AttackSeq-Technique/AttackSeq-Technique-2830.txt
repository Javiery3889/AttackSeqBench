To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions that after establishing communication with a Command and Control (C2) server using a specific protocol (RESTful Strapi) and data encoding (JSON-based), we are looking for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred for transferring data over the C2 channel. This implies we are looking for a technique related to data exfiltration or communication through the established C2 channel.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the establishment of a C2 channel and the subsequent action of transferring data. The techniques provided in the answer choices relate to different aspects of data handling and exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1558.001-Golden Ticket**: This technique involves creating a forged Kerberos ticket to access systems without being detected. It doesn't directly relate to transferring data over a C2 channel.
   - **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 protocol that is symmetrically encrypted. While it does involve data transfer, the question specifies the use of a C2 channel, not a non-C2 protocol.
   - **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from a system. Given that a C2 channel has been established, automated exfiltration could indeed occur over this channel, especially since the question mentions transferring data.
   - **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving data that has been collected from a system. While it's a step in the data exfiltration process, it doesn't directly relate to the transfer of data over a C2 channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the action taken after establishing a C2 channel, which implies the need for a technique related to using this channel for data transfer.
   - Techniques like Golden Ticket (A) and Archiving Collected Data (D) don't directly relate to the act of transferring data over the established C2 channel.
   - Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol (B) involves a non-C2 protocol, which doesn't match the scenario described.
   - Automated Exfiltration (C) is the most relevant, as it involves the transfer of data, which could logically occur after a C2 channel has been established, especially in the context of using specific protocols and encoding for data transfer.

**Final Answer: C**
