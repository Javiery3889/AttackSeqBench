To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers, after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails, deploy custom-built backdoors and publicly available Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to support their campaigns. We need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK technique that best describes this activity.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) starts with initial access via spear-phishing, followed by the deployment of malicious tools (backdoors and RATs) to maintain access or facilitate further malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**: This technique involves obtaining and using code signing certificates to make malicious code appear legitimate. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to deploying backdoors and RATs.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining software, tools, or expertise to support the attack. Deploying custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs fits well within the scope of obtaining capabilities to support an attack campaign.
   - **C: T1491.001-Internal Defacement**: This technique is about modifying or defacing internal web pages. It doesn't align with the deployment of backdoors and RATs for maintaining access or controlling compromised systems.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: While phishing is mentioned in the initial access phase, this choice doesn't describe the deployment of tools like backdoors and RATs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question asks for the technique that describes the deployment of custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs after initial access has been gained.
   - The initial access method (spear-phishing) is already established, so we're looking for a technique that involves the use or deployment of malicious tools.
   - **T1588-Obtain Capabilities** directly relates to acquiring and using tools (like backdoors and RATs) that support the attackers' campaigns.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by the technique related to obtaining and utilizing malicious tools for campaign support.

Final Answer: B
