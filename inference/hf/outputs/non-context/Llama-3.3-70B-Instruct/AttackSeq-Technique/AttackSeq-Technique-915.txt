To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Tuyul botnet executing commands on victim systems. This implies that the botnet has already gained access to these systems. The techniques mentioned ('shell' and 'perl') suggest that the botnet is using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands, but the question asks about the technique that most likely occurred before this step to enable access.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves gaining access to vulnerable systems and then executing commands. The techniques mentioned for command execution are 'shell' and 'perl', which are related to interacting with the system after access has been gained.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet. It's a common method for gaining initial access to a system.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external services to interact with a system, but it doesn't directly imply gaining initial access through exploitation.
   - **C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This is a sub-technique of "Scheduled Transfer" and doesn't directly relate to the initial exploitation or access phase.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique is about using existing scripting or command-line interfaces to execute commands, which aligns with the 'shell' and 'perl' functionalities mentioned but doesn't explain how initial access was gained.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred before the botnet could execute commands, implying we're looking for an initial access technique.
   - Executing commands via 'shell' and 'perl' suggests the botnet has already gained access.
   - Among the options, **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is the most direct method for gaining initial access to a system by exploiting a vulnerability, which would then allow the botnet to execute commands using techniques like those described.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the need for an initial access technique that precedes the execution of commands by the Tuyul botnet, the most plausible sequence starts with exploiting a vulnerability to gain access.

Final Answer: A
