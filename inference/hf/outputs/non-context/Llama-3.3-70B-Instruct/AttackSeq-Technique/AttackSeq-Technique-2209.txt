To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Earth Lusca engaged in lateral movement, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: Earth Lusca has already engaged in lateral movement, exploiting remote services, and used tools like lcx and frp to establish network tunnels. This indicates they have gained access to the network and are looking to further their objectives within the victim's environment.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence so far involves:
   - Lateral Movement (T1021) using exploitation of remote services.
   - Establishing network tunnels, which could be related to techniques like Proxy (T1090) or Tunneling (T1572), though not explicitly mentioned.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**: This involves exploiting weak permissions on executable installer files to execute malicious code. While it could be a part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly follow from lateral movement and establishing network tunnels as a necessary next step.
   - **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves collecting data from a network shared drive. After establishing a presence within the network through lateral movement and setting up network tunnels, accessing shared drives could be a logical next step to gather sensitive information.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This involves scanning for and identifying services running on the network. While this could be a part of the reconnaissance phase, it seems more like a precursor to lateral movement rather than a step that follows it, especially when the attacker has already demonstrated the ability to move laterally and establish tunnels.
   - **D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves manipulating the network to redirect traffic to the attacker, often for credential harvesting. While it's a powerful technique for lateral movement, the question implies that lateral movement has already been achieved, making this less likely as the immediate next step compared to exploiting the newly gained access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already performed lateral movement and set up network tunnels, indicating they have a foothold and are looking to expand their access or gather information.
   - The most logical next step after gaining access and establishing a means to maintain or expand that access would be to gather information or resources that can aid in further exploitation or exfiltration.
   - Among the provided options, accessing data from a network shared drive (T1039) seems the most plausible next step as it aligns with the goals of gathering sensitive information or resources after establishing a presence within the network.

**Final Answer: B**
