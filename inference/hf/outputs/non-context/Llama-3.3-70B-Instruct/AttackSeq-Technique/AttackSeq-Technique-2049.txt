To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already harvested corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections. The focus is on what technique would most likely occur next to facilitate movement within the target's networks.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial action involves credential harvesting, which is often associated with techniques like phishing or other forms of social engineering. The next step, as per the question, involves using these credentials to move within the target's networks.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim, which could be part of the initial reconnaissance phase but doesn't directly facilitate movement within the network after credentials have been obtained.
   - **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using authentication materials (like stolen credentials) that are not the usual authentication methods. Given that the attacker has harvested email credentials, using these as alternate authentication material to access the network or specific systems within it is highly plausible.
   - **C: T1547.015-Login Items**: This technique is about adding an item to the login items on a system to maintain persistence. While it's a method for persistence, it doesn't directly relate to the initial movement within the network using harvested credentials.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment systems to deploy malware. It's more related to the execution and persistence phases rather than the initial access and movement phase facilitated by harvested credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already obtained credentials, indicating they are past the initial access phase.
   - The goal now is to move within the target's networks, which requires using the obtained credentials effectively.
   - Using alternate authentication material (stolen credentials) is a direct way to achieve this movement, as it allows the attacker to authenticate as a legitimate user.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible technique that would occur to facilitate movement within the target's networks after harvesting credentials is using those credentials as alternate authentication material.

Final Answer: B
