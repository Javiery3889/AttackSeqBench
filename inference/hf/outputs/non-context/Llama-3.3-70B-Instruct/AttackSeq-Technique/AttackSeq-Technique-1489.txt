To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Babar's dropper used global Windows hooks to invade desktop applications for logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - The question mentions a dropper using global Windows hooks to invade desktop applications. This action is primarily related to capturing user input and possibly monitoring system activities.
   - The specific actions mentioned are logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots, which are techniques used to gather sensitive information from the compromised system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action involves using global Windows hooks for keystroke logging and screenshot capture. This is a form of input capture and surveillance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique involves the use of inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to communicate between processes. While IPC could be used after initial compromise for various malicious activities, it's not directly related to the described actions of keystroke logging and screenshot capture.
   - **B: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump)**: This technique involves using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to gather information about a network or system. It doesn't directly follow from the actions of keystroke logging and screenshot capture.
   - **C: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique directly involves capturing user input, which aligns with the described actions of logging keystrokes. Given that the dropper is already using global Windows hooks for input capture (keystroke logging and possibly mouse events), this seems like a continuation or a more specific categorization of the initial action rather than a subsequent step.
   - **D: T1583.001-Domains**: This involves using domains for command and control (C2) or exfiltration. While it could be a part of a broader campaign, it doesn't directly follow from the specific actions of keystroke logging and screenshot capture as a necessary next step in the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial action is about invading desktop applications for logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots, which is a form of input capture and surveillance.
   - The most direct and related technique from the provided choices that aligns with the initial action (and could logically follow or be part of the same sequence) is input capture.
   - However, considering the question asks for the technique that "most likely occurred after," we need to think about what would logically follow the initial compromise and surveillance. Input capture (T1056) is what's being described in the initial action, so it's not "after" but rather "is" the action.
   - Given the context, the question seems to be slightly misinterpreted in the analysis above because T1056-Input Capture is indeed the technique being described in the scenario provided. The question's phrasing suggests looking for a subsequent action, but all provided choices don't perfectly fit as a direct "next step" in a typical attack sequence without more context.

5. **Final Answer**:
Given the closest alignment with the described actions and considering the need to select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices, the correct interpretation of the question leads to recognizing that the described action (keystroke logging and screenshot capture) is a form of input capture. However, since the question format implies looking for a subsequent action and based on the standard interpretation of ATT&CK techniques, none of the options perfectly fit as a direct next step without assuming additional context not provided in the question. 

But, adhering strictly to the format requested and recognizing the analysis provided might slightly misalign with the expected question interpretation due to the nature of the query:

Final Answer: C
