To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where backdoors have been installed as services capable of executing several malicious functions. This implies that the attacker has already gained access to the system and has established a foothold. The backdoors are about to connect to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands, which is a step typically taken after the attacker has ensured they can maintain access and execute their tools on the compromised system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of events is as follows:
   - Backdoors are installed as services.
   - The backdoors need to prepare for or establish a means to communicate with C2 servers.
   - The backdoors connect to C2 servers to receive commands.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves using chat messages for command and control, which doesn't directly fit the preparation for connecting to C2 servers.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into processes, which could be a method used by the backdoors to execute their malicious functions without being detected. It's plausible that after installation, the backdoors would use process injection to blend in with normal system activity and prepare for C2 communication.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Establishing an encrypted channel is indeed a way to prepare for communication with C2 servers, as it would allow the backdoors to securely receive commands. However, this is more about the method of communication rather than a step that necessarily occurs before connecting to C2 servers.
   - **D: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**: This technique involves using a ticket-granting ticket to access a system, which doesn't directly relate to the preparation for C2 communication after backdoor installation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The backdoors are installed and need to execute malicious functions, possibly without detection.
   - To achieve this, they might use process injection to blend in with normal system processes.
   - Establishing an encrypted channel (T1573) could be part of the communication setup but is more directly related to the communication method rather than a preparatory step for connecting to C2.
   - Given the context, process injection (T1055) seems like a plausible technique for the backdoors to use after installation and before connecting to C2 servers, as it would help in executing their functions stealthily.

**Final Answer: B**
