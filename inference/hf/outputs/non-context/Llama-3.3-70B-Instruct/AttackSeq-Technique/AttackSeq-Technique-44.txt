To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host and before the stolen screenshots were uploaded to the C2 infrastructure, let's analyze the given sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence where KONNI malware has already executed arbitrary code on the infected host. This implies that the malware has gained the capability to perform various malicious activities on the host system. The next step in the sequence involves the uploading of stolen screenshots to the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure. The question asks us to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involves:
   - Execution of arbitrary code by the malware.
   - An unknown technique that we are trying to identify.
   - Uploading stolen screenshots to the C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves archiving data using a custom method, which could be relevant for exfiltrating data but doesn't directly relate to the action of capturing screenshots before they are uploaded.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique directly involves capturing screenshots, which aligns with the action of stealing screenshots before they are uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.
   - **C: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**: This technique involves checking for user activity, which might be part of the malware's behavior but doesn't directly fit between executing arbitrary code and uploading screenshots.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique is about ensuring the malware starts automatically upon boot or logon, which is more related to persistence than the direct action of capturing and uploading screenshots.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already executed arbitrary code, indicating it has control over the system.
   - The next logical step before uploading screenshots would be to capture them.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture** directly corresponds to the action of taking screenshots, which would then be uploaded.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the sequence of events and the techniques provided, the most plausible technique that occurred after the execution of arbitrary code and before the uploading of stolen screenshots is the capture of those screenshots.

Final Answer: B
