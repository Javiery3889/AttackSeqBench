To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Turla malware has already utilized encryption and rootkit capabilities. This implies that the attackers have established a foothold within the target system and are now looking to gather specific information to enhance their spying operation. The key detail here is the transition from evading defenses to gathering information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial actions (utilizing encryption and rootkit capabilities) suggest techniques related to defense evasion (such as T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow, though not directly mentioned, and T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information for encryption, and T1014 - Rootkit for hiding tracks). The question then shifts focus to gathering specific information, indicating a move towards techniques related to "Collection" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1561.001-Disk Content Wipe**: This technique is related to impact, not collection, and involves wiping disk content, which doesn't align with gathering information.
   - **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves collecting data from a network shared drive, which could be part of gathering information but might not directly relate to the "specific information from systems" as described, especially if the focus is on system-specific data rather than shared drives.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which could include databases, file servers, or other data storage systems. This aligns well with gathering specific information from systems to enhance a spying operation, as it implies accessing centralized or specific data stores.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit**: This technique is about using a rootkit to hide malicious software, which is already mentioned as part of the initial actions (utilizing rootkit capabilities) and does not directly relate to the action of gathering information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already established a presence and are hiding their tracks.
   - The next logical step in enhancing their spying operation would be to collect relevant data.
   - Among the given options, collecting data from information repositories (T1213) is the most direct method of gathering specific information from systems.

**Final Answer: C**
