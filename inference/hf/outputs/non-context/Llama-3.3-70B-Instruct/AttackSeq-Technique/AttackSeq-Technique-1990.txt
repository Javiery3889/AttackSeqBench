To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of HTML Smuggling to bypass security controls for deploying ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to ensure malicious payloads were not tagged with MOTW (which could imply avoiding detection or marking as malicious).

2. **Identifying Key Elements**:
   - **HTML Smuggling**: A technique used to bypass security controls by smuggling malicious code or payloads through HTML files.
   - **ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts**: Suggests the deployment of some form of malicious tool or payload.
   - **MOTW**: This could refer to a method of marking or detecting malicious activity, but without specific context, we'll focus on the general goal of avoiding detection.
   - The question is about ensuring malicious payloads avoid detection or tagging, implying a need to subvert security controls or trust mechanisms.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**: This involves using digital certificates to make malicious communications or files appear legitimate. While it could be part of an evasion strategy, it's more about authentication and encryption rather than directly avoiding payload detection.
   - **B: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising infrastructure that can be used for future operations. It doesn't directly relate to avoiding detection of malicious payloads.
   - **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting the trust that a system has in its components or external entities. Given the context of avoiding detection (MOTW) and the use of HTML Smuggling to bypass controls, subverting trust controls could directly relate to ensuring malicious payloads are not detected or flagged.
   - **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This is a technique related to hiding or obfuscating malicious activity by forking processes. While it's an evasion technique, it's more specific to process-level evasion rather than ensuring payloads avoid being tagged as malicious at a higher level.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question implies a need to avoid detection or tagging of malicious payloads after they have been delivered using HTML Smuggling.
   - Subverting trust controls (T1553) directly addresses the goal of ensuring that malicious activities or payloads are not flagged or detected by manipulating the trust mechanisms within a system.
   - The other options, while related to evasion or compromise, do not directly address the specific goal of avoiding detection of malicious payloads in the context provided.

**Final Answer: C**
