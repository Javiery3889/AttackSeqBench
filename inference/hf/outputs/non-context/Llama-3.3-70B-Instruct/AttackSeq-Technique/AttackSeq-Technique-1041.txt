To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after using tools like Mimikatz for credential dumping, the threat actors moved laterally by exploiting CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue). The use of Mimikatz indicates that the attackers were likely trying to obtain credentials, which is a part of the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The exploitation of EternalBlue for lateral movement suggests the attackers were moving from an initial compromised system to other systems within the network.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The use of Mimikatz for credential dumping aligns with the technique T1003 - Credential Dumping.
   - The exploitation of CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) for lateral movement aligns with the technique T1201 - Exploitation for Client Execution, but more specifically, in the context of lateral movement, it could be related to T1021.002 - Exploitation of Remote Services (though the exact technique might slightly vary based on the specifics of the exploitation).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of credential dumping followed by lateral movement using EternalBlue.
   - **B: T1592 - Gather Victim Host Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the host, which could include network and system details. This could plausibly occur before lateral movement as attackers might want to understand the network layout and potential targets.
   - **C: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task**: This involves creating a scheduled task to execute a program or script, which could be a method for persistence or execution but doesn't directly fit the sequence described.
   - **D: T1027.001 - Binary Padding**: This technique involves modifying the size of a binary to evade detection, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of credential dumping and lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers used Mimikatz, indicating they were interested in credentials.
   - Before moving laterally using EternalBlue, it would make sense for the attackers to gather information about the network and potential targets to identify vulnerable systems.
   - Gathering victim host information (T1592) would provide the attackers with the necessary details to plan their lateral movement effectively.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of the attack sequence, the most plausible technique to occur before the threat actors moved laterally by exploiting EternalBlue would be gathering information about the victim's host to identify potential targets and plan the lateral movement.

Final Answer: B
