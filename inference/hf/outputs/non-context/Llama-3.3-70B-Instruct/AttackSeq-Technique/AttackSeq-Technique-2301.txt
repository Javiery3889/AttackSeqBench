To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question and its answer choices step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the DNSpionage campaign and its actions during the initial reconnaissance phase, specifically highlighting the retrieval of the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information. This indicates a phase where attackers are gathering information about their target.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key action here is the "detailed discovery commands to retrieve the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information." This action suggests that the attackers are in the process of gathering specific information about the victim's environment, which is a part of the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. While it could be relevant in the broader context of the campaign, it doesn't directly relate to the initial reconnaissance phase of gathering user-specific information.
   - **B: T1001.001-Junk Data**: This sub-technique involves sending junk data as part of a C2 protocol to make detection more difficult. It doesn't directly relate to the action of gathering specific user and system information.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**: Phishing for information could be a precursor to the DNSpionage campaign, as it involves tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, which could include usernames, hostnames, and domain information. This technique aligns with the initial phase of gathering information about potential targets.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique directly involves collecting information about the victim, such as usernames and hostnames. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **before** the detailed discovery commands, suggesting we're looking for something that precedes this action in the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The DNSpionage campaign's actions indicate a targeted approach, suggesting that some form of initial reconnaissance or information gathering would be necessary to identify and tailor the attack.
   - Phishing for information (T1598) can be an effective way to gather preliminary information about targets, which can then be used to launch more targeted attacks, such as the DNSpionage campaign.
   - Given that T1589 (Gather Victim Identity Information) is what the DNSpionage campaign is doing, we need to look for a technique that would logically precede this action, potentially setting it up by providing initial information or access.

5. **Final Answer**: Considering the need for an initial technique that would facilitate or precede the gathering of victim identity information, **C: T1598-Phishing for Information** seems the most plausible. Phishing could be used to gain initial access or information that then allows for more targeted attacks, such as the detailed discovery commands used in the DNSpionage campaign.

**Final Answer: C**
