To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions receiving instructions from C2 (Command and Control) servers to encode configuration files using single-byte XOR keys. This implies a communication between a compromised system and its controllers, suggesting a phase of an attack where the attackers are trying to maintain access or escalate privileges. The goal is to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, indicating the attack has a political motivation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The key elements here are the use of C2 servers and the encoding of configuration files. Encoding files, especially with simple methods like single-byte XOR, is often used to evade detection by security software. However, the question doesn't directly mention the technique used for disruption but asks for the most likely ATT&CK technique involved in disrupting websites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1547.013 - XDG Autostart Entries**: This technique involves adding an entry to the user's autostart directory to execute malware when the user logs in. While it's a method for persistence, it doesn't directly relate to disrupting websites.
   - **B: T1498 - Network Denial of Service**: This technique involves overloading a network or system to make it unavailable, which could be used to disrupt websites. Given the goal of disrupting websites, this seems like a plausible choice.
   - **C: T1499.001 - OS Exhaustion Flood**: This is a specific type of denial-of-service attack targeting operating system resources. While it could be used to disrupt systems, it's more specific to exhausting system resources rather than a general disruption of websites.
   - **D: T1590.001 - Domain Properties**: Modifying domain properties could be used for various malicious purposes, including redirecting traffic, but it's less directly related to the disruption of websites through overload or denial of service.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question hints at a method to disrupt websites, which suggests a denial-of-service type attack.
   - Encoding configuration files and communication with C2 servers indicate a sophisticated attack with potential for various malicious actions, including disruption.
   - Among the options, **B: T1498 - Network Denial of Service** is the most directly related to disrupting websites by overloading them, making them unavailable.

**Final Answer: B**
