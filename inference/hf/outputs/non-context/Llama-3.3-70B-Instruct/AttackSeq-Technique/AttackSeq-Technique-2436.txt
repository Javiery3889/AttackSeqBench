To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions reading commands from a file during Command and Control, which implies an attacker is controlling a compromised system. The specific action involves interacting with ATM drivers and dispensing money using the 'msxfs.dll' library. This library is associated with Microsoft Extended Functionality for Windows, which can be used to interact with hardware devices, including ATMs.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves Command and Control (which is a broader tactic) and then a specific action of interacting with ATM hardware to dispense money. The techniques mentioned in the choices need to be evaluated in the context of this action.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique directly relates to the theft of financial resources, which aligns with the action of dispensing money from an ATM. It's a technique under the "Impact" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, focusing on the financial gain aspect of an attack.
   - **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using tools to deploy software. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to interacting with ATM hardware or dispensing money.
   - **C: T1489-Service Stop**: This technique involves stopping system services. It might be used in an attack to disable security services, but it doesn't directly relate to the action of dispensing money from an ATM.
   - **D: T1053.003-Cron**: This sub-technique involves scheduling tasks to execute at a specific time. While it could be used in an attack for persistence or execution, it doesn't directly relate to interacting with ATM hardware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies an action that results in financial theft through interacting with ATM hardware.
   - The most relevant technique should directly relate to the outcome of the action described (dispensing money).
   - T1657-Financial Theft is the technique that directly aligns with the financial gain aspect of the attack described.

**Final Answer: A**
