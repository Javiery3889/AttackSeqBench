To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving APT28, a known advanced persistent threat group, engaging in an attack that includes scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. This activity is part of the Discovery tactic, which involves gathering information about the target environment. The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely employed after this initial discovery phase to centralize the information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial activity mentioned is scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems, which falls under the Discovery tactic. The next step in the attack sequence, as per the question, involves centralizing the information gathered during this discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the containers and resources available within a network or system. While it is a discovery technique, it is more focused on specific resources rather than centralizing information about vulnerable systems.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using non-standard protocols. It does not directly relate to the centralization of information about vulnerable systems for the purpose of discovery.
   - **C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This sub-technique involves accessing process memory, which could be part of a broader effort to gather system information but does not directly relate to centralizing discovery information about vulnerable systems.
   - **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems, which aligns with scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. It is directly related to the Discovery tactic and could involve centralizing information about these systems as part of the attack's reconnaissance phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies activities that are part of the Discovery tactic, focusing on scanning and identifying vulnerable systems.
   - The correct answer should directly relate to the centralization of information about these systems as part of the attack's reconnaissance.
   - T1018-Remote System Discovery is the most relevant technique because it directly involves identifying and potentially centralizing information about remote systems, which aligns with the described activities.

**Final Answer: D**
