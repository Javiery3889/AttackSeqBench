To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Spearphishing**: The attack begins with spearphishing, which is a social engineering technique used to gain initial access to a system. This is typically categorized under "Phishing" (T1566) in the ATT&CK framework, but since the question asks for the technique that facilitated communication after initial access, we need to look beyond the initial access technique.

2. **Defense Evasion using Double Extension Trick**: The attackers used a double extension trick for defense evasion. This technique involves disguising malicious files with fake extensions to evade detection, which aligns with various defense evasion techniques in the ATT&CK framework, but the specific technique mentioned here (double extension trick) is more about evading detection rather than facilitating communication.

3. **Facilitating Communication**: The question specifically asks about the technique that most likely facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems after the initial access and defense evasion. This implies we are looking for a technique related to "Command and Control" (C2) communication.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication, which could include HTTP, FTP, etc. It's a plausible method for communicating with compromised systems, as it can blend in with normal network traffic.

- **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This involves using non-standard encoding schemes for C2 communication, which could be used to hide or obscure the communication, making it harder to detect.

- **C: T1010-Application Window Discovery**: This technique is related to discovering application windows, which doesn't directly relate to facilitating C2 communication.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial access technique and not relevant to facilitating communication after the initial compromise.

Considering the need for a technique that facilitates communication with compromised systems, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant. It directly pertains to the methods an adversary might use to communicate with compromised systems, which is essential for command and control operations.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the initial access and defense evasion techniques mentioned.
2. Recognize that the question asks for the technique facilitating communication.
3. Evaluate each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the requirement for C2 communication.
4. Select the technique that best aligns with C2 communication needs.

**Final Answer: A**
