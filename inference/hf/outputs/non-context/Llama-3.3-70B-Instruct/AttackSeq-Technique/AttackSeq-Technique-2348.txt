To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after BRONZE PRESIDENT took steps to minimize detection, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT has already taken steps to minimize detection. These steps include deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes post-execution. Deleting volume shadow copies is typically associated with T1490 (Inhibit System Recovery), which is aimed at making it difficult for system administrators to recover from a malicious event by deleting backups. Terminating processes post-execution can be related to T1070 (Indicator Removal), which involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves actions taken to avoid detection after initial compromise or execution of malicious code. This implies that the attackers are trying to cover their tracks.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing**: This technique involves manipulating process arguments to make a legitimate process appear as if it's performing legitimate actions when it's actually executing malicious code. While this could be part of an evasion tactic, it doesn't directly relate to the actions described (deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes).
   - **B: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**: This technique involves bypassing Gatekeeper, a security feature in macOS that controls what software can be run on a system. This doesn't directly follow from the actions described, which seem more focused on post-compromise activities rather than initial execution or bypassing security controls for execution.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**: Phishing for information is about tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information. This doesn't align with the post-compromise, detection evasion tactics described.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique directly involves removing indicators of compromise, which aligns with the actions described (deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes post-execution) as these are methods used to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The actions described (deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes) are aimed at avoiding detection.
   - T1070 (Indicator Removal) is directly related to these actions as it involves removing indicators that could lead to the detection of malicious activity.
   - The other options, while potentially part of a broader campaign, do not directly follow from the described actions in the context of avoiding detection post-compromise.

**Final Answer: D**
