To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the actors used commands like systeminfo.exe and net.exe for gathering system and network-related information but before achieving lateral movement to the Domain Controller using wmic.exe, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The actors have already used systeminfo.exe and net.exe, which are typically used for gathering system and network information. This places their actions within the Discovery phase of the attack, where they are trying to understand the environment.
   - The use of these tools suggests they are looking for potential vulnerabilities or pathways for further exploitation.
   - The next step mentioned is lateral movement to the Domain Controller using wmic.exe, which implies they are looking to expand their access within the network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence starts with information gathering (using systeminfo.exe and net.exe).
   - The next step should logically involve using the gathered information to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - Lateral movement to the Domain Controller is the ultimate goal mentioned before achieving this step.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery:** This involves techniques used to get information about running processes on a system. While it's a discovery technique, it's more focused on process-level information rather than the network or system configuration that would directly lead to identifying a Domain Controller for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1087.004-Cloud Account:** This is related to cloud account discovery, which doesn't directly fit the context of moving laterally within an on-premises network to a Domain Controller.
   - **C: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the permissions and groups of users or systems, which could be crucial in identifying how to move laterally within a network, especially to a sensitive target like a Domain Controller. Understanding permission groups could help attackers find a vulnerable pathway.
   - **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This involves creating or modifying system processes, which could be a step in establishing persistence or privilege escalation but doesn't directly relate to the discovery phase leading to lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers have already performed initial discovery.
   - They are looking to move laterally to a Domain Controller, which requires understanding the network layout, user permissions, and potential vulnerabilities.
   - Among the given options, discovering permission groups (T1069) would provide valuable information on how users and systems are structured, potentially revealing pathways for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C**
