To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions a sequence of actions by the Lazarus Group, specifically:
   - Utilizing compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement.
   - Using encrypted configuration files for defense evasion.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely involved in the collection of information related to the target's system details, which occurs before the lateral movement and after defense evasion.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The use of encrypted configuration files for defense evasion suggests the attackers are trying to hide their tools or communications, which is a technique to avoid detection.
   - Utilizing compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement implies the attackers have already gained access to the system and are now moving within it, possibly to expand their control or find specific data.
   - The collection of system details would logically occur after initial access and potentially after some form of evasion technique to ensure the attackers can operate undetected.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This involves gathering information about peripheral devices connected to a system. While it's a form of system information, it's more specific to devices rather than overall system details.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**: This is a technique used for initial access, not for collecting system information after access has been gained.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, hardware, and software configurations. This would be crucial for planning further actions, such as lateral movement, and aligns well with the need to understand the target environment after gaining access.
   - **D: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique is about creating a local account, which is more related to persistence or privilege escalation rather than the collection of system information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attackers have already evaded defenses, suggesting they are inside the system and looking to gather more information.
   - The next logical step before moving laterally with compromised accounts would be to understand the system's layout, which includes discovering system information.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery** fits this requirement as it involves gathering details about the system, which would be necessary for effective lateral movement and further exploitation.

**Final Answer: C**
