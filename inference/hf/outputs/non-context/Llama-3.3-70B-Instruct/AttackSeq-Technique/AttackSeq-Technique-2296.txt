To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, after executing a reconnaissance phase to gather user and domain information, needs to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server. The reconnaissance phase is aimed at exfiltrating user and domain information, and the next step involves intercepting traffic through DNS communication for further instructions.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial phase mentioned involves reconnaissance, which aligns with gathering information about the target. The subsequent action involves communicating with a C2 server, which would require establishing a means of communication that could be covert and not easily detectable, such as using existing protocols or services in a way that blends in with normal traffic.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: This technique is related to the initial reconnaissance phase mentioned but does not directly facilitate communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**: This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for C2 communication, which could be a method for receiving further instructions but might not be the most direct or common method for DNS-related communication.
   - **C: T1608.002-Upload Tool**: This technique involves uploading tools to a target system, which might be a part of the attack sequence but does not directly relate to facilitating communication with a C2 server through DNS.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. Given that DNS is an application layer protocol and the question mentions intercepting traffic through DNS communication, this option seems highly relevant. Using DNS for C2 communication is a known tactic that allows attackers to hide their communications within legitimate DNS traffic, making it harder to detect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already conducted reconnaissance.
   - The next step involves communicating with a C2 server.
   - The communication needs to be covert and related to DNS, as per the question.
   - Among the given options, using an application layer protocol (specifically DNS in this context) for C2 communication aligns with the need for covert communication that blends in with normal network traffic.

**Final Answer: D**
