To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the context of MuddyWater's campaign, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The question mentions that after using compromised servers to host malicious code for second-stage attacks, MuddyWater sent encoded base64 output with process information to the attacker. The sequence involves:
   - Compromised servers hosting malicious code.
   - Sending encoded base64 output with process information.

2. **Analyze Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1090.004 - Domain Fronting**: This technique involves using different domain names in the SNI (Server Name Indication) field of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake and the HTTP Host header to obfuscate the true destination of the HTTP request. While domain fronting can be used for hiding command and control (C2) communications, it doesn't directly relate to the act of sending encoded data or the immediate steps following the hosting of malicious code on compromised servers.
   
   - **B: T1132 - Data Encoding**: This technique involves using various encoding schemes to hide or obscure data. Given that the question mentions sending "encoded base64 output," this technique directly aligns with the action of encoding data (in this case, process information) before transmission. Base64 is a common encoding scheme used for this purpose.
   
   - **C: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet. While exploiting public-facing applications can be a method for initial access, it doesn't directly fit the sequence described, which involves actions taken after the initial compromise (hosting malicious code and sending encoded data).
   
   - **D: T1036.007 - Double File Extension**: This technique involves using files with double extensions (e.g., file.txt.exe) to deceive users about the true file type. This technique is more related to initial access or execution tactics rather than the sequence described, which focuses on post-compromise actions and data encoding for transmission.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question outlines a sequence where compromised servers are used to host malicious code, followed by an action, and then the sending of encoded process information.
   - The action of sending "encoded base64 output" directly implies data encoding.
   - Among the provided choices, **T1132 - Data Encoding** is the technique that most directly aligns with the action of encoding data (process information) in base64 format before sending it to the attacker.

**Final Answer: B**
