To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after gaining domain administrator credentials through Mimikatz, APT15 deployed backdoors such as RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this deployment.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials and the subsequent deployment of backdoors (RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS). Mimikatz is a tool known for credential dumping, which aligns with the technique of OS Credential Dumping.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow**: This technique involves modifying Unix password files, which doesn't directly relate to the use of Mimikatz for gaining Windows domain administrator credentials.
   - **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This involves collecting data from information repositories, which could be relevant in a broader context of an attack but doesn't directly precede the deployment of backdoors after credential dumping.
   - **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique directly involves dumping credentials from the operating system, which is exactly what Mimikatz is used for. Given that the question states credentials were gained through Mimikatz, this technique is the most likely to have occurred before deploying backdoors.
   - **D: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**: This technique involves embedding payloads within other files, which might be relevant to how backdoors are delivered but doesn't directly relate to the action of gaining credentials before deploying backdoors.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifies the use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - Mimikatz is primarily used for OS Credential Dumping.
   - The deployment of backdoors like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS would logically follow after gaining the necessary credentials.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves OS Credential Dumping before deploying backdoors.

Final Answer: C
