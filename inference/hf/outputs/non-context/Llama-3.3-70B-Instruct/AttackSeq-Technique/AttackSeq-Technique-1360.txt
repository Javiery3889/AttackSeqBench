To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a file named "Rdws.exe" is executed, leading to the retrieval of a first-stage downloader, which then establishes Command and Control (C2) communication with specific domains (e.g., cdn[.]sanecat[.]com). The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely preceded these activities to initially gain access to the system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The described activities involve executing a malicious file and establishing C2 communication, which suggests that the initial access technique must have allowed the adversary to deliver or execute this file on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. While it could be part of the communication process after initial access, it doesn't directly explain how the initial access was gained.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access. This could be a plausible initial access technique as it allows adversaries to execute malicious code on a system, potentially leading to the execution of files like "Rdws.exe".
   - **C: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**: This technique involves stealing session cookies to gain access to systems or applications. While it's a method of gaining access, it's more related to maintaining access or moving laterally within a network rather than the initial execution of a malicious file.
   - **D: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This sub-technique involves using domain accounts to gain access. While important for lateral movement or privilege escalation, it doesn't directly explain how the initial malicious file execution occurred.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial access technique needs to facilitate the execution of "Rdws.exe".
   - Exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) is a common method for gaining initial access to a system, allowing for the execution of malicious files.
   - The other options either relate more to post-exploitation activities or do not directly lead to the execution of a malicious file as described.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most likely technique to have preceded the described activities for initial system access is exploiting a public-facing application, as it provides a direct method for executing malicious code on the victim's system.

Final Answer: B
