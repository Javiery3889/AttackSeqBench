To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions a threat actor group using a multi-step process involving batch files to decode and deploy additional malicious payloads. Before this action, the group needed to deliver malicious documents to victim organizations.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the delivery of malicious documents and the subsequent use of batch files for decoding and deploying payloads. The delivery of malicious documents often involves social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1137.006-Add-ins**: This technique involves using add-ins (like Microsoft Office add-ins) to execute code. While it could be part of the attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the initial delivery of malicious documents.
   - **B: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**: This involves compromising hardware before it reaches the target, which doesn't directly relate to the delivery of malicious documents via digital means.
   - **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique is about exploiting weaknesses in elevation control mechanisms to gain higher privileges, which might be a post-exploitation tactic rather than the initial delivery method.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a common technique used to deliver malicious documents (e.g., via email attachments) to victims, which they then open, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question implies an initial step of delivering malicious documents to victim organizations.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a well-known method for delivering such documents, often through spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - The subsequent use of batch files for decoding and deploying payloads suggests a post-exploitation phase, which would follow the initial delivery and execution of the malicious document.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of delivering malicious documents to facilitate further malicious activity, the most likely ATT&CK technique involved is phishing, as it directly relates to the initial delivery mechanism of malicious documents.

Final Answer: D
