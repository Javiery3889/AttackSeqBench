To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions that involve gaining initial access to a system. The actions mentioned include remotely controlling software, creating new local accounts on internal hosts, and the use of tools for enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely involved these actions before gaining initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned include:
   - Enumerating services
   - Authenticating via brute force
   - Scanning ports
   These actions are typically part of the reconnaissance phase or initial access phase of an attack, where an adversary is trying to gather information about the target system or network to find vulnerabilities to exploit.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for open ports and services, which aligns with the actions of enumerating services and scanning ports mentioned in the question. Active scanning can also be used to identify potential vulnerabilities and is often used in conjunction with brute force authentication attempts to gain access.
   - **B: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: This technique involves gathering information about the domain, which might not directly relate to the actions of scanning ports, enumerating services, or brute force authentication.
   - **C: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique is about using an external proxy to obfuscate the source of traffic, which does not directly involve the actions described in the question.
   - **D: T1197-BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to execute jobs, which is more related to executing code or transferring files rather than the initial reconnaissance or access actions described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on actions taken before gaining initial access, which suggests we are looking for techniques related to reconnaissance or initial compromise.
   - Enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports are all actions that would help an adversary understand the target's network and systems better, identifying potential vulnerabilities.
   - Among the given options, **T1595-Active Scanning** is the most directly related to these actions, as it involves actively engaging with the target system to gather information about its services and potential vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer: A**
