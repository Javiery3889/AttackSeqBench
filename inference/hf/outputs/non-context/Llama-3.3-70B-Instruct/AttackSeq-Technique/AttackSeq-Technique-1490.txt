To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions a specific sequence of actions by malware (Babar) that involves capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks before initiating communication with its Command and Control (C&C) servers through remote thread injection. The key elements here are:
   - Capturing data from desktop applications.
   - Use of global Windows hooks.
   - The action happens before communicating with C&C servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The question is asking for the ATT&CK technique that aligns with capturing data (likely sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, etc.) from desktop applications using global Windows hooks. This implies a technique focused on collecting input or visual data from the user's interactions with applications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging**: Keylogging involves capturing keystrokes, which can be achieved through various methods, including the use of global Windows hooks to monitor and log keystroke events. This technique directly aligns with capturing data from desktop applications by monitoring user input.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves transferring data from a system without using the typical communication protocols, which doesn't directly relate to the method of capturing data from applications.
   - **C: T1113-Screen Capture**: Screen capture involves taking screenshots of the desktop or specific applications, which could capture visual data but doesn't specifically involve global Windows hooks for capturing keystrokes or input data.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands, which doesn't directly relate to capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question specifically mentions capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.
   - Global Windows hooks can be used to capture keystrokes among other events, making keylogging a likely candidate.
   - Keylogging (T1056.001) directly involves capturing user input, which aligns with the use of global Windows hooks for data capture.
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that aligns with the described sequence of capturing data before communicating with C&C servers is keylogging.

Final Answer: A
