To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Smooth Operator initiated without affecting normal usage of the library and before collecting domain and account name values from 3CX file config.json for exfiltration, let's analyze the given information and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question implies an attack sequence where an initial action (Smooth Operator initiation) does not disrupt the normal functioning of a library. This is followed by an unknown action (the one we're trying to identify) and then the collection of specific data (domain and account name values) from a configuration file for exfiltration.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with an initial compromise or access (Smooth Operator), followed by an unknown technique, and ends with data collection (which could be related to T1082-System Information Discovery, as collecting domain and account names can be part of system information discovery).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves collecting information about the system, which could include domain and account names. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred before collecting this information, suggesting that T1082 might be too close to the action of collecting domain and account name values to be the correct answer.
   - **B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This is a technique used for man-in-the-middle attacks, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence of initiating an attack, maintaining normal library usage, and then collecting specific system information.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which could be done after initial access to avoid detection but before exfiltrating data. It fits the timeline of being after the initial access (Smooth Operator) and before data collection.
   - **D: T1484.002-Trust Modification**: This involves modifying trust settings, which could potentially be part of an attack sequence but doesn't directly fit the context of maintaining normal usage and then collecting specific system information for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial action (Smooth Operator) suggests an initial access or compromise.
   - The need to maintain normal library usage suggests that the next step should not disrupt the system significantly.
   - The action of collecting domain and account name values for exfiltration suggests that the attacker is looking to gather specific information about the system or its users.
   - Given these points, the most plausible next step after initial access and before data collection would be to ensure the attack remains undetected, which aligns with **T1070-Indicator Removal**.

**Final Answer: C**
