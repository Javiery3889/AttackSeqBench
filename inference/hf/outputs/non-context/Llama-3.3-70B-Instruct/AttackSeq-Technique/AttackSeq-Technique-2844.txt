To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The malware sends system information to an IP address ('45.124.132.127') using the command line. This action implies communication with a Command and Control (C2) server.
   - The communication leverages HTTPS with a POST method, indicating the use of an application layer protocol for data transfer.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial step involves the malware sending system information, which could be part of an initial access or execution tactic but is more directly related to the command and control (C2) phase.
   - The use of HTTPS with a POST method for communication with the C2 server is key to identifying the technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop resolver for C2 communication, which doesn't directly relate to the use of HTTPS and POST methods for sending system information.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communication. Given that the malware uses HTTPS with a POST method to communicate with the C2 server, this technique aligns closely with the described behavior.
   - **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique is about using software deployment tools for initial access or execution, which doesn't directly match the scenario of sending system information to a C2 server.
   - **D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**: This technique is related to impacting cloud computing resources, which is not relevant to the described scenario of malware communicating with a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario describes malware communicating with a C2 server, which is a common aspect of command and control tactics.
   - The use of HTTPS with a POST method for sending system information indicates the application layer protocol is being leveraged for this communication.
   - Among the provided options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the technique that directly involves using application layer protocols (such as HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communication, making it the most relevant to the scenario described.

**Final Answer: B**
