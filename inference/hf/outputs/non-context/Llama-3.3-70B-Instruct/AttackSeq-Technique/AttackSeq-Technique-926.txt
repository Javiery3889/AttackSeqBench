To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Explosive Trojan leveraged its capabilities to move laterally through the network using manual methods and USB infection, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Initial Action**: The Explosive Trojan has already moved laterally through the network. This implies that the attacker has gained access to the network and is now expanding their reach within it. Lateral movement (T1021) is about moving from one system to another within the network, often to gain greater access or control.

2. **Analyzing the Techniques**:
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This involves using application layer protocols to communicate with command and control (C2) servers or to exfiltrate data. Given that the Trojan has already moved laterally, it's plausible that the next step could involve using application layer protocols for further communication or data exfiltration.
   - **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which could be part of the attacker's goals but doesn't directly follow from lateral movement in a necessary sequence.
   - **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**: This involves using a ticket-granting ticket to access resources without needing the user's password. While this could be a step in an attack, it's more related to credential access and might not directly follow lateral movement unless the attacker is specifically trying to access restricted resources.
   - **T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique is about using chat applications for command and control. While possible, it's less directly related to the immediate actions following lateral movement compared to other options.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence**: After moving laterally, an attacker would likely want to establish a means of communicating with the compromised systems or exfiltrating data. Among the given options, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most directly related to establishing communication or exfiltrating data, which are common next steps after gaining access to a network.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of lateral movement and the need for further communication or data exfiltration, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence would involve using application layer protocols.
