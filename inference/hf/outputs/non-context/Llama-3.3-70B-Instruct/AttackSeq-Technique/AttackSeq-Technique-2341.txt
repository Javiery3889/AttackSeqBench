To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions an attacker using a scheduled task for persistence to ensure the execution of malicious code. Then, it talks about executing a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro using the 'mshta.exe' tool to download and execute a malicious dropper. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this sequence.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The use of a scheduled task for persistence refers to the technique **T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job**.
   - Executing a VBA macro to download and execute a malicious dropper involves initial access and execution techniques, possibly starting with **T1566 - Phishing** if the macro was delivered via a phishing email, which is a common initial access vector.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This is mentioned in the question as part of the sequence but is not what we're looking for since we need the technique that occurred before executing the VBA macro.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves manipulating network protocols to gain access, which doesn't directly relate to the execution of VBA macros or the use of 'mshta.exe' for downloading malicious files.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**: While valid accounts can be used for persistence and execution, the question hints at an initial access vector that leads to the execution of a VBA macro, not just the use of valid accounts.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is a common initial access technique where attackers send phishing emails with malicious attachments (like documents with VBA macros) that, when opened, can lead to the execution of malicious code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker executes a VBA macro, which is often delivered through phishing emails.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a typical initial access technique that can lead to the execution of malicious code, including VBA macros.
   - The use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a malicious dropper follows the initial access, fitting into the sequence of exploiting a system after gaining access.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context that the execution of a VBA macro often follows a phishing campaign aimed at gaining initial access to a system, the most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with phishing.

Final Answer: D
