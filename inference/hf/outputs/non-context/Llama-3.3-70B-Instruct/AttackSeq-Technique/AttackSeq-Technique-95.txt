To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The attacker used WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to check for installed antivirus software. This action is related to discovering system information, specifically about security products that could hinder the attack.
   - The attacker avoided PowerShell execution during defense evasion, suggesting they are trying to remain stealthy and avoid detection by traditional security monitoring tools that often focus on PowerShell activity due to its common use in attacks.
   - The attacker needs to send information about the detected antivirus software to a C2 (Command and Control) server using "webserv-redir.net".

2. **Identify Relevant ATT&CK Techniques**:
   - **WMI for System Information Discovery**: This aligns with `T1082-System Information Discovery`, as WMI is a method used to gather information about a system, including installed software.
   - **Avoiding PowerShell Execution**: This is a defense evasion technique but is not directly related to the question about sending information to a C2 server.
   - **Sending Information to C2 Server**: This involves communicating with a C2 server, which can be achieved through various application layer protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: This technique involves using multiple proxies to obscure the source of traffic. While it could be used for C2 communication, the question does not specifically mention proxy hopping.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique is about gathering information about the system, which has already been done using WMI. The question asks about sending this information to a C2 server, not gathering it.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) for C2 communication. Given that the attacker is sending information to a C2 server using "webserv-redir.net", which implies a web-based redirect or communication, this seems highly relevant.
   - **D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**: This technique is related to using a combination of identities (local and cloud) for authentication. It does not directly relate to sending system information to a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already used WMI for system information discovery.
   - The focus is on sending the discovered information to a C2 server.
   - The use of "webserv-redir.net" suggests a web-based communication method.
   - `T1071-Application Layer Protocol` is the most relevant technique for this action, as it involves using protocols like HTTP for communication with a C2 server.

**Final Answer: C**
