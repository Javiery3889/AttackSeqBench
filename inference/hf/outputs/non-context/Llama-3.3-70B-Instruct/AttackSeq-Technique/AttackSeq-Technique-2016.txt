To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Welcome Chat app exfiltrated sensitive data from the victim device, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Analysis of the Situation**: The Welcome Chat app has already exfiltrated a significant amount of sensitive data, including SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, recorded calls, and GPS data. This indicates that the app has gained access to various aspects of the device, potentially exploiting trust or vulnerabilities to collect this data.

2. **Understanding the Exfiltrated Data**: The data exfiltrated includes GPS data, which is crucial for understanding the victim's location. This implies that the attackers are interested not only in the victim's communication and personal data but also in their physical movements and location.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1614-System Location Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's location. Given that GPS data has already been exfiltrated, which directly relates to the device's (and thus the victim's) location, it's plausible that the attackers would use this information to understand the system's location better. However, the exfiltration of GPS data itself is a strong indicator of location discovery.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves undermining the trust mechanisms in place on a system. While this could be a part of the initial infection vector or a method to maintain access, it doesn't directly follow the exfiltration of data as a logical next step in terms of utilizing the exfiltrated data.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the compromised system. Given that data has been exfiltrated, using application layer protocols could be a method for command and control (C2) communication, but it's not directly related to the act of exfiltrating data itself.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol to bypass network restrictions. While this could be used for exfiltration or C2 communication, it's more about evading detection rather than a direct consequence of having exfiltrated specific types of data like GPS.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the context that the attackers have already exfiltrated GPS data, which directly relates to the system's (and victim's) location, the most logical next step related to utilizing this information would involve further understanding or leveraging the system's location. However, since the question asks for the technique that "most likely occurred after" the exfiltration, and considering the provided options, **T1614-System Location Discovery** seems less likely as it's more about the initial gathering of location information, which has presumably already been achieved through GPS data exfiltration.

Considering the logical flow of actions after data exfiltration, especially when thinking about how attackers might utilize the exfiltrated data for further malicious activities, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** seems more plausible as it could be used for command and control communications following the exfiltration, potentially to receive further instructions or to send the exfiltrated data back to the attackers. However, the direct connection to the exfiltrated data types (like GPS) and the subsequent actions isn't strongly aligned with any of the options provided in a typical attack sequence.

Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the provided options and their relevance to post-exfiltration activities, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** might seem like a plausible choice for C2 communication post-exfiltration, but it's essential to note that the question's framing and the options provided don't perfectly align with a typical, straightforward sequence of events following data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C**
