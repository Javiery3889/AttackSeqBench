To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where ProjectM conducts reconnaissance by targeting Indian government and military personnel using spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites. The question asks how ProjectM most likely developed its capabilities after this initial reconnaissance phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial TTPs mentioned involve reconnaissance and initial access techniques, specifically spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The question implies that after gaining initial access or information, ProjectM would need to develop its capabilities further.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1543.005-Container Service**: This option refers to a specific technique related to creating and managing containers, which doesn't directly relate to developing capabilities after reconnaissance.
   - **B: T1584.008-Network Devices**: This involves compromising network devices, which could be a part of expanding access but doesn't directly address developing capabilities.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This option directly addresses the development of capabilities, which aligns with the question's implication that after initial reconnaissance, ProjectM would seek to enhance its capabilities.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: While gathering victim identity information could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it doesn't directly relate to developing capabilities after the initial phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question outlines an initial phase of reconnaissance and access.
   - The next logical step for an adversary like ProjectM, after gaining initial access or information, would be to enhance or develop its capabilities to achieve its objectives.
   - Option C (T1587-Develop Capabilities) directly addresses this need to develop capabilities, which would include improving tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for further operations.

**Final Answer: C**
