To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker has already gained initial access to a system by exploiting a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and has established a backdoor. The attacker then uses macOS malware for persistence, specifically mentioning the use of a LaunchAgent or a persistent Chrome browser extension. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before these persistence methods were employed.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The techniques mentioned for persistence are related to maintaining access to the compromised system. LaunchAgents are used on macOS to execute tasks at specific times or under specific conditions, and persistent Chrome browser extensions can be used to maintain a foothold on a system through the browser. The question asks us to look backward in the attack sequence to find a technique that would logically precede these persistence methods.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to establish a command and control channel. While it could be part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to the actions taken for persistence on a macOS system using LaunchAgents or Chrome extensions.
   - **B: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**: This technique involves adding SSH authorized keys to a system to maintain access. It is a method of persistence but is more related to maintaining access via SSH rather than through LaunchAgents or browser extensions.
   - **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which could be a precursor to establishing persistence mechanisms like LaunchAgents. Modifying system processes can facilitate the execution of malicious code or the installation of persistence mechanisms.
   - **D: T1484.001-Group Policy Modification**: This technique is related to modifying group policies, which is more relevant to Windows environments rather than macOS, especially in the context of using LaunchAgents for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has already gained initial access and established a backdoor.
   - The goal now is to maintain persistence on a macOS system.
   - The use of LaunchAgents or persistent Chrome browser extensions for persistence suggests that the attacker needs to ensure their malware or backdoor remains active even after system reboots or user sessions end.
   - Among the given options, **T1543-Create or Modify System Process** is the most relevant technique that would occur before establishing persistence through LaunchAgents or Chrome extensions. This is because creating or modifying system processes can be a necessary step to ensure that the malware or backdoor can execute properly and maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
