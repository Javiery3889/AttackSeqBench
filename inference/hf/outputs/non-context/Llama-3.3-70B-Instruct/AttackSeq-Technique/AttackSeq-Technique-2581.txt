To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the described event, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware evades detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker. 
   - It uses InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, to execute its payload via proxy execution. 
   - The key elements here are the evasion of security controls and the use of a legitimate utility for malicious purposes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step involves evading security controls (SmartScreen and AppLocker) and using a trusted utility (InstallUtil.exe) for proxy execution. This indicates a technique where an adversary leverages a legitimate utility to execute malicious code, which aligns with the concept of "Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution."

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking a user into revealing sensitive information or performing a certain action. It does not directly relate to the evasion of security controls or the use of trusted utilities for proxy execution.
   - **B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space:** This sub-technique is related to password attacks, specifically reducing the number of possible keys to guess. It does not fit the context of evading detection and using a trusted utility for execution.
   - **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This involves encoding data in a non-standard way to avoid detection. While evasion is a component, it doesn't directly relate to the use of a trusted utility for proxy execution.
   - **D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using utilities signed by legitimate software vendors to proxy the execution of malicious code, which directly aligns with the scenario described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The scenario describes the use of InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, to evade detection and execute malicious code.
   - This action directly corresponds to using a trusted developer utility for proxy execution.
   - The other options (A, B, C) do not directly relate to the specific action of using a trusted utility for executing malicious code in the context provided.

**Final Answer: D**
