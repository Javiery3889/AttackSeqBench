To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the utilization of a DLL side-loading vulnerability to execute a new Korplug variant during Mustang Panda's campaign. DLL side-loading is a technique where an attacker exploits the way Windows loads DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This is often used to evade defenses because the malicious activity appears to be coming from a legitimate process.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The key TTP mentioned here is the exploitation of a DLL side-loading vulnerability. This technique is used to execute malicious code (in this case, the Korplug variant) while disguising it as a legitimate process.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to execute malicious code. While related, it's broader than what's specifically described in the question.
   - **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves hijacking the execution flow of a process, which aligns closely with the concept of DLL side-loading. DLL side-loading is a form of hijacking the execution flow by loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process.
   - **C: T1546.002-Screensaver**: This technique involves using a screensaver to execute code when the system is idle. It does not directly relate to the exploitation of DLL side-loading vulnerabilities.
   - **D: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying a container to execute malicious code. While containers can be used for various malicious purposes, this does not directly relate to the exploitation of DLL side-loading vulnerabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions exploiting a DLL side-loading vulnerability, which is a method to hijack the execution flow of a legitimate process.
   - Among the given options, **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** is the technique that most closely aligns with the exploitation of DLL side-loading vulnerabilities, as it involves altering the execution path of a process to execute malicious code.
   - The other options either describe different techniques that, while potentially used in the same campaign, do not directly relate to the exploitation of DLL side-loading vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer: B**
