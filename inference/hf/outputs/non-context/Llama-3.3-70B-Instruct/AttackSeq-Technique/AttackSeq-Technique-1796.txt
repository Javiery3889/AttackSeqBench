To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and relate them to the ATT&CK techniques provided in the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, specifically the OceanLotus Group during Operation Cobalt Kitty, has already compromised machines and harvested credentials. The next step involves using Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks to further infect the network. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the group's expansion within the network after credential harvesting but before utilizing Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) here involves:
   - Credential harvesting (not explicitly listed but mentioned as a precursor).
   - The technique we are trying to identify, which facilitates network expansion.
   - Utilization of Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks for further infection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1546.008-Accessibility Features**: This technique involves exploiting accessibility features to execute malicious code. While it could be part of an attack chain, it doesn't directly relate to the use of harvested credentials for network expansion.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This involves removing indicators of compromise. It's more about evasion than expansion within a network.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternate authentication material (like pass-the-hash, or stolen certificates) that could have been obtained during the initial compromise or credential harvesting phase. This directly aligns with using harvested credentials to move laterally within a network.
   - **D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This technique is specific to hijacking SSH sessions, which might not directly relate to the scenario described, especially since the focus is on Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies the use of harvested credentials for further network infection.
   - The most relevant technique that aligns with using harvested credentials (especially in the context of Windows environments and pass-the-hash attacks) for network expansion is using alternate authentication material.
   - Therefore, the technique that best fits the scenario described is **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**.

**Final Answer: C**
