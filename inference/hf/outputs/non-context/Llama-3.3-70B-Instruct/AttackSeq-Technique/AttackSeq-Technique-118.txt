To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and analyze each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which provides a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by attackers.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after achieving persistence with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, Agrius aimed to ensure command execution and minimize detection. This implies the need for techniques that facilitate executing commands without being detected, which is crucial after establishing a foothold in a system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
   - **Persistence** is already achieved through the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - The next steps would logically involve **Command and Control (C2)** and **Defense Evasion** tactics to execute commands and avoid detection.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to execute commands. While it's a method for command execution, it doesn't directly address minimizing detection.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique is about removing indicators that could be used to detect the adversary's presence. It directly contributes to minimizing detection but doesn't ensure command execution.
   - **C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**: This is a specific sub-technique of Process Injection (T1055), which involves injecting code into another process. It can be used for both command execution and evasion, as it allows an adversary to hide their malicious code within a legitimate process.
   - **D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands indirectly to obscure the intent or origin of the command. It aids in both command execution and evasion by making it harder to detect the source of the commands.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The goal is to ensure command execution and minimize detection after achieving persistence.
   - Techniques that allow for command execution while evading detection are preferred.
   - **T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection** and **T1202-Indirect Command Execution** both offer ways to execute commands while potentially evading detection. However, **T1055.011** is more about hiding the code within a process, and **T1202** is about executing commands in an indirect manner.
   - Given the context of minimizing detection after establishing a backdoor, **indirect command execution** seems more aligned with the goal of evading detection while executing commands, as it doesn't necessarily involve code injection but rather executing commands through intermediate steps or tools, which can be less detectable.

5. **Final Answer**: 
Given the need for both command execution and minimizing detection after establishing persistence, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve indirect methods to execute commands, making **T1202-Indirect Command Execution** the most appropriate choice for ensuring command execution while minimizing the risk of detection.

**Final Answer: D**
