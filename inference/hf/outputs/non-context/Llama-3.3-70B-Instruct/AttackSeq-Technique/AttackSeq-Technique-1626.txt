To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after APT28 deployed additional modules like pr.dll to collect and upload stolen data to the C&C server, and before exfiltrating specific information such as .pst and .dbx files to the central server, let's analyze the given sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28, a known threat actor, involving the deployment of additional modules (like pr.dll) for data collection and upload to a Command and Control (C&C) server. This is followed by the exfiltration of specific file types (.pst and .dbx files) to a central server. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - Deploying modules for data collection and upload.
   - The technique in question (which we are trying to identify).
   - Exfiltrating specific files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for communication. While it could be relevant in the context of communicating with a C&C server, it doesn't directly imply the action of collecting specific data types before exfiltration.
   - **B: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This involves using the Rundll32 utility to execute a DLL, which could be relevant for executing the deployed modules like pr.dll but doesn't directly relate to the collection of specific data types before exfiltration.
   - **C: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle**: This technique involves positioning oneself between two points of communication to intercept data. While it could be used for data collection, it doesn't specifically fit the sequence of collecting and then exfiltrating specific file types as described.
   - **D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which could include email files (.pst) and database files (.dbx), aligning with the action of collecting specific data types before exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurs after deploying modules for data collection and before exfiltrating specific file types.
   - The deployment of modules like pr.dll suggests a preparation phase for data collection.
   - The exfiltration of .pst and .dbx files indicates a specific interest in certain data types.
   - Among the provided choices, **T1213-Data from Information Repositories** directly relates to collecting specific data types from repositories, which fits the sequence of actions described.

**Final Answer: D**
