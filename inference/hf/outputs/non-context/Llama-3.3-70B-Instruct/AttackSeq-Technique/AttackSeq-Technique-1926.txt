To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious Firefox browser extension, FriarFox, is delivered via a phishing email. This implies an initial access tactic, likely through "Phishing" (T1566), though the question focuses on subsequent actions.
   - The extension establishes its capabilities for defense evasion, which could involve various techniques, but the question specifically asks about the extension contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The key action here is the extension contacting a server to retrieve a payload (Scanbox), which suggests a communication or command and control (C2) channel is being established or utilized.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to hide C2 communications. While plausible, the question does not specifically mention encryption.
   - **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This involves using non-standard authentication methods, which doesn't directly relate to the action of contacting a server to retrieve a payload.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communications, which aligns with the scenario of a browser extension (an application) communicating with a server.
   - **D: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This involves taking control of existing sessions, which doesn't directly relate to the action of retrieving a payload from a server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the communication between the malicious extension and a server to retrieve a payload.
   - The most relevant technique in this context involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control, as it directly relates to the application (browser extension) communicating with a server.
   - While encryption (T1573) could be used in this communication, the question does not specify this detail, making T1071 a more direct match based on the information provided.

**Final Answer: C**
