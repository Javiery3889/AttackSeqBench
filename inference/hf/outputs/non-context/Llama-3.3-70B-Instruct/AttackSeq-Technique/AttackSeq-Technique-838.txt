To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an AES key is encrypted with RSA and sent to a C2 (Command and Control) server. This implies a communication channel has been established for command exchange. After this, WinDealer exfiltrates ".a" files from the %TEMP% directory. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before this exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The key elements here are the encryption and communication with a C2 server, followed by data exfiltration. The techniques mentioned in the answer choices are about hiding artifacts, dynamic resolution, using non-application layer protocols, and logon scripts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding malicious artifacts, which could be relevant in many stages of an attack but doesn't directly relate to the communication or exfiltration process described.
   - **B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique is about resolving addresses or hosts dynamically, which could be part of establishing communication with a C2 server but doesn't directly precede exfiltration in a logical sequence based on the given context.
   - **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for application-layer communications, which could be relevant for C2 communication, especially if the attackers are trying to evade detection by using unusual protocols. This could logically precede exfiltration as it establishes a potentially covert channel for data transfer.
   - **D: T1037.001-Logon Script (Windows)**: This technique involves using logon scripts for persistence or execution, which doesn't directly relate to the encryption, C2 communication, or the specific act of exfiltrating files described in the scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario describes a sophisticated attack involving encryption and C2 communication, indicating a need for covert communication channels.
   - The exfiltration of files, especially from a temporary directory, suggests that the attackers are looking to retrieve specific data, possibly using a method that avoids typical network monitoring.
   - Given the context of C2 communication and the need for potentially covert data transfer, using a non-application layer protocol makes sense as it could be used to both communicate with the C2 server and exfiltrate data without being easily detected.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the exfiltration of the ".a" files involves using a non-application layer protocol for communication and data transfer, which aligns with **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**.

Final Answer: C
