To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the delivery of Windows Shortcut files leading to hex-encoded malicious binaries for the installation of persistent malware, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes an initial attack vector involving phishing emails, chat messages, and Facebook posts. These are used to deliver Windows Shortcut files that contain hex-encoded malicious binaries. The goal is the installation of persistent malware. The techniques mentioned in the question are related to the initial stages of an attack, specifically the delivery and potentially the execution phase of the malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with phishing (T1566-Phishing) as the initial delivery method. The delivery of Windows Shortcut files leading to hex-encoded malicious binaries suggests an attempt to execute malware on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This involves using cloud accounts for persistence. While it could be a part of the attack, it doesn't directly follow the execution of malware from shortcut files.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malware automatically when a user logs on or when the system boots. Given that the goal is the installation of persistent malware, this technique aligns well with achieving persistence after the initial malware execution.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial technique used in the attack vector described in the question, not a subsequent action.
   - **D: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**: This involves manipulating access policies, which might not directly relate to the immediate actions following the execution of malware from shortcut files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack starts with phishing (T1566-Phishing), which is used to deliver malicious files.
   - The delivery of these files aims to execute malware, potentially leading to the installation of persistent malware.
   - For malware to be considered persistent, it needs to survive system reboots or user logoffs/logons.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** directly supports the goal of achieving persistence by ensuring the malware executes upon system boot or user logon, making it a plausible next step after the initial execution of malware.

**Final Answer: B**
