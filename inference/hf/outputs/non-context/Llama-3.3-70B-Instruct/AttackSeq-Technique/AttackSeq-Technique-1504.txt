To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Iron group, involving the use of hardcoded shellcode to load a Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory. Before this action, the malware installer checked for VM (Virtual Machine) execution during the installation process. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after this check.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The key actions mentioned are:
   - Checking for VM execution during the installation process.
   - Using hardcoded shellcode to load a Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **T1197 - BITS Jobs**: This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download and execute files. While it could be part of a broader campaign, it doesn't directly relate to the action of checking for VM execution or the immediate loading of a Cobalt Strike beacon.
   - **T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtual machines or sandboxes, which aligns with the action of checking for VM execution. If the malware detects it's running in a VM, it might decide not to proceed or alter its behavior to evade detection.
   - **T1102 - Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to communicate with a C2 server. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly follow the action of checking for VM execution.
   - **T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (Repeated)**: This is a repetition of option B, indicating a potential error in the question formatting.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The action of checking for VM execution suggests the attackers are trying to avoid being detected in a sandbox or virtual environment.
   - The most logical next step after detecting or checking for a VM would be to attempt evasion if the environment is not suitable for the intended malicious activity.
   - Loading a Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory could be part of the post-exploitation activities but checking for VM execution and then proceeding with evasion techniques would logically precede or accompany such actions to ensure the malware operates undetected.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the sequence of actions, the technique that most likely occurred after the malware installer checked for VM execution is related to evading detection in virtual or sandbox environments. 

Final Answer: B
