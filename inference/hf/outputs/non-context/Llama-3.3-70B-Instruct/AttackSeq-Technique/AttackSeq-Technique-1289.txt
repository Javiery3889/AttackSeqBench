To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious document with an enabled macro triggers a routine upon opening (via `Document_Open()`), which eventually leads to the execution of a final payload using PowerShell files (like `invoker.ps1`).
   - The key elements here are the use of a macro in a document to initiate the attack, the involvement of PowerShell for executing the payload, and the goal of achieving persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial vector is a malicious document with a macro, which suggests a social engineering or phishing attack to get the victim to open the document.
   - The macro triggers a malicious routine, indicating code execution.
   - The use of PowerShell (`invoker.ps1`) to execute the final payload points towards command and scripting interpreter techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using the Windows command shell to execute commands. While it's related to command execution, the specific mention of PowerShell suggests a more specific technique.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves making data or files hard to detect. The question doesn't directly imply obfuscation as the primary method before achieving persistence.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. Given the use of PowerShell (a scripting interpreter) to execute the final payload, this seems highly relevant.
   - **D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**: This technique involves generating domains for command and control (C2) communications. The question doesn't mention anything about domain generation or C2 communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attack starts with a macro in a document, which is a common initial access vector.
   - The macro triggers a routine, leading to further malicious activity.
   - The use of PowerShell to execute the final payload is a key indicator of the technique used before achieving persistence.
   - Given the focus on executing scripts (in this case, PowerShell scripts), the most relevant technique is related to using a command and scripting interpreter.

**Final Answer: C**
