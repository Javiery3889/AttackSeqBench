To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the Gholee malware avoided detection, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question mentions the Gholee malware using mechanisms to hide from debuggers and employing obfuscation techniques to avoid detection. This implies the malware is attempting to evade analysis and detection, which is a common goal of attackers after they have gained access to a system or have deployed their malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves the deployment or execution of the Gholee malware and its subsequent actions to avoid detection. The techniques mentioned (hiding from debuggers and obfuscation) are related to defense evasion (a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**: This technique involves shutting down or rebooting a system, which doesn't directly relate to the actions of avoiding detection through hiding from debuggers and obfuscation.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves disguising as a different entity or process, which could be related to evasion techniques but is more about pretending to be something else rather than directly avoiding detection through technical means like obfuscation.
   - **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**: This technique involves using code that changes its form to avoid detection, which aligns closely with the concept of obfuscation and evasion mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control, which doesn't directly relate to the evasion techniques described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question describes the Gholee malware using specific evasion techniques.
   - The most relevant technique that would occur before or in conjunction with these evasion methods would be something that also aids in evasion or is a precursor to the need for such evasion.
   - **T1027.014-Polymorphic Code** directly relates to changing the code's form, which is a method of evasion and closely aligns with the described behavior of the malware.
   - The other options either do not directly relate to evasion through code modification or obfuscation or describe actions that are not as closely tied to the immediate need to avoid detection as polymorphic code is.

**Final Answer: C**
