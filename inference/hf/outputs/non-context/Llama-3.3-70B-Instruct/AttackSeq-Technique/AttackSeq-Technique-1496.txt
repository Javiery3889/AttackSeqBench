To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the use of the Invoke-Obfuscation tool's COMPRESS technique to prepare RogueRobin. This implies an attempt to evade detection, likely by a sandbox environment, which is a common method used by attackers to test if their malware can bypass security controls. The question then asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to ensure the payload could maintain a foothold on the system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - Preparation of the payload (RogueRobin) using Invoke-Obfuscation to evade detection.
   - The need for the payload to maintain a foothold on the system after initial execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to execute malicious code. While it could be a method for maintaining persistence, it's not the most direct method related to ensuring a payload maintains a foothold after initial execution.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique is about exfiltrating data using non-standard protocols, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining a foothold on a system.
   - **C: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page**: This technique involves modifying an Outlook home page to execute code, which is a very specific method and less likely to be the general approach for maintaining a foothold after executing a payload like RogueRobin.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code automatically during system boot or user logon, which directly relates to maintaining persistence and ensuring a foothold on a system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question implies the attacker has already taken steps to evade detection (using Invoke-Obfuscation).
   - The goal now is to ensure the payload (RogueRobin) can remain on the system.
   - Among the given options, the technique that best aligns with maintaining a foothold or persistence on a system after initial execution is related to ensuring the malware starts again after a reboot or when a user logs on.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context of needing to maintain a foothold on the system after executing a payload, the most plausible technique from the MITRE ATT&CK framework is related to ensuring the malware can start automatically upon system boot or user logon.

Final Answer: D
