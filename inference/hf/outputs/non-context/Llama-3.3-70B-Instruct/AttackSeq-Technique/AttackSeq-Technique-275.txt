To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses a vulnerability exploit to execute an embedded .hta file via mshta.exe. This action is followed by the need to maintain the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by automatically executing files at regular intervals.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The initial action involves exploiting a vulnerability and executing a file, which suggests techniques related to execution and persistence. The specific mention of executing files at regular intervals to maintain the agent's presence points towards techniques related to persistence.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1070.001 - Clear Windows Event Logs**: This technique is related to defense evasion, where an attacker clears Windows Event Logs to hide their tracks. While this could be part of an attack sequence, it does not directly relate to executing files at regular intervals for persistence.
   - **B: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task or job to execute at a specific time or interval. It is directly related to persistence, as it allows an attacker to maintain access to a system by executing malicious files or commands at regular intervals.
   - **C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for communication. It is more related to command and control (C2) communication rather than the execution of files for persistence.
   - **D: T1546.001 - Change Default File Association**: This technique involves changing the default file association to execute malicious files. While it can be used for initial access or execution, it does not directly relate to the automatic execution of files at regular intervals for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial exploit and execution via mshta.exe indicate a need for persistence to maintain the Helminth Trojan agent's presence.
   - The requirement for automatic execution at regular intervals suggests a technique that allows for scheduled or periodic execution of malicious files or commands.
   - Among the provided options, **T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job** is the technique that best aligns with the need to execute files at regular intervals, as it enables attackers to schedule tasks for persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
