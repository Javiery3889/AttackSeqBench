To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the abuse of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to avoid detection. This implies that an attacker has already gained some level of access to a system or network and is using this access to create a covert channel for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. The question specifically asks about the initial access phase to compromise external remote services.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves initial access and the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling. The initial access phase is about how the attacker first gains access to the system or network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging**: This technique involves creating a malicious process in the context of a legitimate process. While it's a method for evading detection, it's not typically associated with the initial access phase or directly with compromising external remote services.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique involves using default accounts to gain access. Default accounts can be used for initial access, especially if they have not been properly secured or changed. This could be a plausible method for gaining initial access to external remote services.
   - **C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique is about loading code into a process in a way that makes it difficult to detect. Like Process Doppelgänging, it's more about evasion and persistence rather than initial access.
   - **D: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique directly involves using external remote services, which could include exploiting them for initial access. Given that the question mentions compromising external remote services during the initial access phase, this seems highly relevant.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question focuses on the initial access phase to compromise external remote services.
   - The use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling indicates a level of access has already been achieved, but we're looking for how this initial access was gained, specifically in the context of external remote services.
   - Techniques like Process Doppelgänging and Reflective Code Loading are more about post-compromise activities rather than initial access.
   - Default Accounts could be a vector for initial access but are not as directly related to compromising external remote services as the correct answer choice should be.
   - External Remote Services (T1133) directly pertains to using external services for access, making it the most relevant to the initial access phase described.

**Final Answer: D**
