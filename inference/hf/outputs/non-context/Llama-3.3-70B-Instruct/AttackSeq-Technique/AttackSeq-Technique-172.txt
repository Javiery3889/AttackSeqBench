To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before 'Surtr' connects to a command and control server (C2) and downloads a stage two component to a specific directory, let's analyze the given options in the context of the described sequence of events.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where 'Surtr' (likely a piece of malware or a malicious tool) connects to a C2 server and downloads a second-stage component. This action implies that an initial compromise has already occurred, and the attacker is now establishing a more persistent presence or escalating their attack.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key event here is the connection to a C2 server and the download of additional malware components. This suggests that the initial access has been achieved, and the attacker is moving to establish command and control and possibly to execute further malicious actions.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers trick victims into revealing sensitive information or executing malicious code. It's plausible that phishing could be the initial vector that leads to the execution of 'Surtr' and its subsequent connection to a C2 server.
   - **B: T1610-Deploy Container**: Deploying a container is more related to the execution and persistence of malicious code within an environment, rather than the initial access or setup of a C2 channel.
   - **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**: This technique involves using publish/subscribe messaging patterns for C2 communications. While it's related to C2 communications, it doesn't directly imply the initial setup or the action of downloading a second-stage component.
   - **D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to obscure the C2 channel. While relevant to C2 communications, it describes a method of communication rather than the initial compromise or setup.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The scenario implies an initial compromise has occurred, allowing 'Surtr' to connect to a C2 server.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a common initial access technique that could lead to the execution of malicious code, such as 'Surtr', which then connects to a C2 server.
   - The other options, while related to aspects of the attack lifecycle, do not as directly precede the described action of connecting to a C2 server and downloading additional components as an initial access technique like phishing would.

**Final Answer: A**
