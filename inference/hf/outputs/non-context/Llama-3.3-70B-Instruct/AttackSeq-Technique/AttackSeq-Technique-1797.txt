To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the OceanLotus Group gained initial access, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that the OceanLotus Group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails. This implies the use of targeted phishing attacks to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links, which then allow the attackers to gain access to the victim's system.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The technique used for gaining initial access is spear-phishing, which aligns with the ATT&CK technique **T1566 - Phishing**. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred **before** this initial access. This means we are looking for a preparatory or development phase activity rather than the execution phase of the attack.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1218.013 - Mavinject**: This is a sub-technique related to "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation" and involves using the Mavinject tool to inject code into a running process. This would occur after initial access has been gained, not before.
   - **B: T1566 - Phishing**: This is the technique used for gaining initial access as described in the question, not before.
   - **C: T1587 - Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing capabilities that can be used in future operations, such as creating or obtaining exploit code, malware, or tools. This could include the development of the spear-phishing emails and the malicious content (e.g., weaponized Word documents) used for initial access.
   - **D: T1587.003 - Digital Certificates**: This sub-technique involves obtaining and using digital certificates to make malicious activities appear legitimate. While this could be part of developing capabilities, it's more specific to the use of certificates and might not directly relate to the preparation of spear-phishing campaigns unless the certificates are used to sign malicious code or emails to make them appear more legitimate.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred **before** the initial access via spear-phishing.
   - Spear-phishing (T1566) is the method of initial access, so we need a technique that precedes this in the attack sequence.
   - Developing capabilities (T1587) is a broader category that can include the preparation and development of tools, tactics, and techniques used in attacks, including the creation of spear-phishing campaigns.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence suggests that before executing the spear-phishing attack, the attackers would engage in developing or preparing their capabilities, which includes the creation of the malicious emails and payloads.

**Final Answer: C**
