To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions exploiting CVE-2021-40444 for client execution. CVE-2021-40444 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can lead to remote code execution when a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. This suggests an initial access vector that involves tricking a user into opening a malicious document.
   - It also mentions abusing PowerShell for the Empire stager. Empire is a post-exploitation framework that can be used for lateral movement, persistence, and other malicious activities within a network. The use of PowerShell indicates a method of executing commands and scripts on a compromised system.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated access to victim systems before these actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** Phishing involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. Given that CVE-2021-40444 can be exploited by getting a user to open a malicious document, phishing is a plausible initial access technique. It aligns with the scenario of sending a user a malicious Office document that they open, thereby initiating the exploit.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This involves compromising a system by exploiting a vulnerability in a web browser or its plugins when a user visits a malicious website. While this could potentially lead to code execution, it doesn't directly align with the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office documents.
   - **C: T1556.004-Network Device Authentication:** This technique involves using brute force or other methods to guess or crack authentication credentials for network devices. It doesn't directly relate to the exploitation of a client-side vulnerability like CVE-2021-40444.
   - **D: T1136-Create Account:** Creating a new account on a system could be part of establishing persistence or privilege escalation but doesn't directly facilitate initial access to victim systems in the context provided.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 for client execution implies an initial access technique that involves user interaction, such as opening a malicious document.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a common technique used to trick users into performing actions that compromise their systems, such as opening malicious attachments.
   - The subsequent use of PowerShell for an Empire stager suggests post-exploitation activities, which would follow initial access.
   - Therefore, the most plausible initial access technique, given the context of exploiting a client-side vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a malicious document, is phishing.

Final Answer: A
