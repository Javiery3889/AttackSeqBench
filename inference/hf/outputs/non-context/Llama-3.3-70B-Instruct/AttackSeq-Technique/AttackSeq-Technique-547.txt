To determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before the threat actors compromised over twenty high-profile websites to inject JavaScript code, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where threat actors compromised multiple high-profile websites to inject JavaScript code, which then loaded additional malicious code from their Command and Control (C&C) servers. This indicates a sophisticated attack involving initial access, persistence, and possibly privilege escalation, all leading to the execution of malicious code.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The key elements here are the compromise of websites and the injection of JavaScript code to load additional malicious code. This suggests that before the compromise, the attackers needed a way to gain access or control over these websites.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves gaining control over infrastructure that can be used for future operations. Compromising websites to use them for malicious activities, such as injecting JavaScript code, fits this description. It's plausible that compromising infrastructure (websites in this case) occurred before the injection of malicious code.
   - **B: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**: This involves duplicating traffic to make malicious traffic blend in with legitimate traffic. While this could be a part of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the initial compromise of websites for injecting JavaScript code.
   - **C: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**: This technique involves using code signing certificates to make malicious code appear legitimate. Although this could be used in the broader context of an attack, it doesn't directly explain how the websites were initially compromised.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. While this could be part of the attack chain, especially for executing malicious code, it doesn't directly address how the initial compromise of the websites occurred.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The threat actors needed to gain access to the websites first.
   - Compromising infrastructure (T1584) would allow them to use these websites for malicious purposes, such as injecting JavaScript code.
   - The other options, while potentially part of the attack chain, do not directly explain the initial compromise necessary for injecting malicious code into the websites.

**Final Answer: A**
