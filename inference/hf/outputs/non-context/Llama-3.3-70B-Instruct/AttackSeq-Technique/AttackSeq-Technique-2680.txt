To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Analyze the Question**: 
   - The question mentions ZoxPNG using the WinInet API for HTTP communication to evade detection.
   - It specifically talks about establishing communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server through HTTP requests that involve PNG files.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) here involves evading detection and communicating with a C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **A: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to transfer data. It doesn't match the scenario described, which involves HTTP communication.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services for communication. Given that ZoxPNG uses HTTP requests to communicate with the C2 server, this seems like a plausible choice, especially since it can involve hiding data within web traffic, such as using PNG files.
   - **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique is about using one network protocol to signal or trigger actions in another protocol. While it involves network communication, it doesn't directly relate to hiding C2 communication within HTTP requests.
   - **D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**: This involves taking control of an existing SSH session. It doesn't relate to the scenario described, which focuses on HTTP communication and evading detection through PNG files.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker (ZoxPNG) uses HTTP communication to evade detection and communicate with a C2 server, specifically by using PNG files in HTTP requests.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this scenario would involve using web services for C2 communication, which aligns with using HTTP requests for such purposes.
   - Given the details, **B: T1102-Web Service** is the most appropriate choice because it directly relates to using web services (like HTTP) for communication, which can include hiding malicious traffic within seemingly innocuous web requests, such as those involving PNG files.

Final Answer: B
