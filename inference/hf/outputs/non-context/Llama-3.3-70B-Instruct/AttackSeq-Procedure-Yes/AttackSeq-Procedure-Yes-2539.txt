To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) typically associated with threat actors like Deep Panda, in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, identified as Deep Panda, has already gained access to a system and is using PowerShell scripts and batch files to execute the Milestone backdoor. The Milestone backdoor is a tool that allows attackers to maintain access to compromised systems. The question asks whether it is likely that Deep Panda would perform system information discovery before using the backdoor to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The initial step involves executing the Milestone backdoor using PowerShell scripts and batch files, which aligns with the "Execution" tactic (TA0002) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1059).
   - The next step mentioned is system information discovery. In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this would fall under the "Discovery" tactic (TA0007), which includes techniques such as "System Information Discovery" (T1018).
   - Finally, the question mentions utilizing the backdoor to communicate with a C2 server, which is part of the "Command and Control" tactic (TA0011), specifically the technique "Application Layer Protocol" (T1071) if the communication is over standard protocols, or "Unsecured Credentials" (T1079) and "Command and Control" (T1094) for more specific scenarios.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **System Information Discovery**: After gaining initial access and before exfiltrating data or establishing a stable C2 channel, attackers often seek to understand the environment they are operating in. This includes gathering information about the system, such as its configuration, installed software, and network connections. This step is crucial for planning further actions, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.
   - **Communication with C2 Server**: Establishing a reliable and covert communication channel with a C2 server is essential for the attacker to issue commands, receive stolen data, and maintain access to the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Deep Panda has already executed the Milestone backdoor, indicating they have gained access to the system.
   - **Step 2**: To effectively utilize the compromised system, understand its capabilities, and plan further malicious activities, performing system information discovery is a logical next step. This would provide Deep Panda with the necessary insights to decide how to proceed, whether it be to move laterally within the network, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
   - **Step 3**: After gathering system information, using the backdoor to communicate with a C2 server would be a natural progression. This communication could be used to exfiltrate the gathered system information, receive further commands, or upload additional malware.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the typical behaviors of threat actors like Deep Panda and the logical progression of tactics and techniques in a cyber attack, it is indeed likely that system information discovery would occur before or as part of utilizing the backdoor for C2 communication. This sequence aligns with known TTPs and the objectives of maintaining access, gathering intelligence, and potentially preparing for further malicious activities.
