To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by threat actors:
   - **Initial Action**: Utilizing subverted trust controls to evade defenses through T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls). This technique involves manipulating trust mechanisms to bypass security controls, allowing the attackers to move undetected within the system.
   - **Follow-up Actions**: The question asks if it's likely that the threat actors then employed T1057 (Process Discovery) to gain knowledge about the systems and internal networks before using compromised infrastructure for command and control via T1071 (Application Layer Protocol).

2. **Understanding the TTPs**:
   - **T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls)**: This involves altering trust settings to bypass security controls, which is a common technique for evading detection.
   - **T1057 (Process Discovery)**: This technique is used to gather information about running processes on a system, which can help attackers understand the system's configuration, identify potential targets, and plan further actions.
   - **T1071 (Application Layer Protocol)**: This involves using application layer protocols to communicate with command and control (C2) servers, which is a common method for controlling compromised systems.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence**:
   - After subverting trust controls (T1553), an attacker would likely want to understand the environment they are operating in to identify potential targets, vulnerabilities, and to plan their next steps without being detected. 
   - **T1057 (Process Discovery)** fits well as a next step because it allows the attackers to gather necessary information about the system processes, which is crucial for deciding how to proceed with the attack, such as identifying processes to hijack or terminate.
   - Finally, using **T1071 (Application Layer Protocol)** for command and control makes sense as it leverages existing protocols to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect the C2 communication.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the logical progression from evading defenses, to gathering information about the system, and then using that information to establish command and control, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns.

**Final Answer: A**
