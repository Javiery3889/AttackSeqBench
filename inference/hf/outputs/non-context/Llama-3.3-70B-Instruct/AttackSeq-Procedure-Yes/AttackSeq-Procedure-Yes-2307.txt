To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the adversary's actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes an adversary using Cobalt Strike for lateral movement to identify target systems and data of interest. After this discovery phase, the question asks if it's likely the adversary will copy results (like file and directory lists from network shared drives) before exfiltrating this data using cloud storage web services.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Lateral Movement**: The adversary is using Cobalt Strike, a tool known for its ability to facilitate lateral movement within a network, allowing attackers to move from system to system.
   - **Discovery**: The adversary is identifying target systems and data of interest. This is a common step after gaining access to a network, where attackers seek to understand the network layout, identify valuable data, and locate potential targets for further exploitation.
   - **Collection**: Copying results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists, is a form of data collection. This step is crucial for planning further actions, such as which data to exfiltrate or which systems to exploit further.
   - **Exfiltration**: The final step mentioned is exfiltrating the collected data using cloud storage web services. This is a common method for transferring stolen data out of the target network, as it can be done stealthily and may bypass traditional network monitoring controls.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The sequence described aligns well with common attack patterns. After identifying valuable data through discovery, it's logical that an adversary would collect this data (in this case, by copying it) before exfiltrating it. Using cloud storage services for exfiltration is also a plausible step, given the ease of use and potential for evasion of detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Lateral Movement and Discovery**: The use of Cobalt Strike for these purposes is well-documented in various cyber attacks. It allows attackers to navigate the network and identify targets efficiently.
   - **Data Collection**: Copying file and directory lists is a natural next step after discovery. This action helps in planning the exfiltration and ensures that valuable data is not missed.
   - **Exfiltration via Cloud Services**: This method is favored by many attackers due to its convenience and the challenge it poses for defenders trying to detect and block such activity.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the logical progression of the attack sequence and the commonality of these TTPs in cyber attacks, it is indeed likely that the adversary would copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data.
