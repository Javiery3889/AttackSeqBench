To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The question starts with the employment of PowerShell injection techniques via the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module for execution. This indicates the adversary has already gained initial access to the system and is using a technique to execute code in memory, which is a common method to evade detection.

2. **TTPs Mentioned**: The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves:
   - **Execution** (using PowerShell injection)
   - **Persistence** or **Defense Evasion** (implied by the use of reflective PE injection to load malware into memory)
   - The potential use of the **SombRAT backdoor** for:
     - **Process Discovery** (to understand the running processes on the compromised system)
     - **System Information Discovery** (to gather information about the system, such as OS version, architecture, etc.)
     - **System Time Discovery** (to understand the system's time settings, potentially for synchronization or evasion purposes)
   - Finally, using tools like **pscan and nmap** for **Network Service Scanning** to identify open ports and services on the network.

3. **Analysis of the Sequence**:
   - The initial use of PowerShell injection for execution is a common technique used by various threat actors to execute malicious code in memory without writing it to disk, which aligns with the first step of executing code on a compromised system.
   - The use of a backdoor like SombRAT for process, system information, and system time discovery fits within the context of an adversary trying to understand the environment they are operating in. This information is crucial for planning further actions, such as lateral movement, persistence, or exfiltration.
   - The subsequent use of network scanning tools like pscan and nmap is a logical next step after the adversary has gathered information about the local system. This would help in identifying potential targets for lateral movement or further exploitation within the network.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Given the logical progression of TTPs from initial access and execution, to gathering information about the system and its environment, and finally to scanning the network for potential vulnerabilities or targets, the sequence described in the question forms a plausible attack sequence.

Therefore, considering the CostaRicto Campaign's employment of sophisticated TTPs and the logical progression of an attack from initial access to network scanning, it is reasonable to conclude that the campaign could indeed use the SombRAT backdoor for the mentioned purposes before proceeding with network service scanning.
