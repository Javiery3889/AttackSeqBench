To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence of events based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks, particularly focusing on the Collection and Exfiltration phases as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a scenario where malware is used for scanning files and staging data for exfiltration. This places us within the Collection phase of an attack, where an adversary gathers information relevant to their objectives. The question then posits the exfiltration of this data to a primary Command and Control (C&C) server over commonly used ports, with a fallback C&C server becoming operational if needed.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - **Collection**: Using malware to scan for and stage data.
   - **Exfiltration**: Sending the collected data to a C&C server.
   - **Command and Control**: Utilizing a primary C&C server for data exfiltration, with a fallback option.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Primary C&C Server Over Common Ports**: It's common for attackers to use non-standard ports or encryption to hide their communications. However, using commonly used ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) can help blend in with normal network traffic, potentially evading detection. This is a plausible initial step for exfiltration.
   - **Fallback C&C Server**: The use of a fallback C&C server is a tactic to ensure continued control and communication if the primary server is detected and blocked. This is a common practice among sophisticated attackers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware's use for scanning and staging data aligns with the Collection phase, indicating the attacker is gathering specific data.
   - **Step 2**: The decision to exfiltrate data to a primary C&C server over commonly used ports is reasonable for initial attempts, as it may help avoid detection by blending in with regular network traffic.
   - **Step 3**: Having a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration for when the primary is compromised or blocked is a sound strategic move, ensuring the attacker can maintain control and communication.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and strategies outlined, it is indeed likely that an attacker would attempt to send data to a primary C&C server over commonly used ports before resorting to a fallback server. This approach maximizes the chances of successful data exfiltration while maintaining redundancy in command and control capabilities.
