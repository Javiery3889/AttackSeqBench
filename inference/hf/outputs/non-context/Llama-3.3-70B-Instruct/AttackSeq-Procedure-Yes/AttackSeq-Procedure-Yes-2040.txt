To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Establishing fake personas and creating falsified identities**: This action is part of the Resource Development phase, where attackers prepare resources, such as infrastructure, tools, and personas, that can be used in future operations. Creating fake personas is a common TTP used by various threat actors, including those from Iran, to deceive targets and gain their trust.

2. **Connecting with US officials on social media to gather victim identity information**: This action falls under the Reconnaissance phase, where attackers gather information about their potential targets. Using social media to gather information is a known TTP, as it allows attackers to collect details about their targets' personal and professional lives, which can be used to tailor future attacks.

3. **Using spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages for Initial Access**: Spear-phishing is a technique used in the Initial Access phase, where attackers attempt to trick specific individuals into divulging sensitive information or gaining access to their systems. Using fake pages (e.g., spoofed websites) is a common tactic to make phishing attempts more convincing.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- **Step 1 (Resource Development)**: Creating fake personas and identities is a plausible initial step for threat actors aiming to deceive and manipulate targets.
- **Step 2 (Reconnaissance)**: Using these fake personas to connect with US officials on social media for gathering information aligns with known TTPs. Social media platforms are rich sources of personal and professional information.
- **Step 3 (Initial Access)**: Utilizing spear-phishing with links to fake pages as a method to gain initial access to targets' systems or information is a well-documented TTP, especially when preceded by reconnaissance that helps in crafting targeted and convincing phishing messages.

Considering the logical progression from preparing resources (fake personas), to gathering information (reconnaissance via social media), to attempting initial access (spear-phishing), the described sequence of TTPs is consistent with known attack patterns used by sophisticated threat actors, including those from Iran.
