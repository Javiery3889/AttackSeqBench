To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate their plausibility in the context of a sophisticated cyber campaign like StellarParticle.

1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with the attackers gaining initial access through methods such as logging into a public-facing system using SSH with stolen credentials and employing VPNs. This is a common initial access technique (TA0001) where attackers use valid accounts (T1078) or exploit public-facing applications (T1190) to gain access.

2. **Persistence**: After gaining access, the attackers aim to persist in the victim's environment. The question mentions configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) persistence and GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry. WMI persistence (T1047) and creating a cron job (T1053, under Scheduled Task/Job) are both recognized techniques for maintaining access to a compromised system.

3. **Defense Evasion**: Finally, the attackers conduct defense evasion by stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA). Stealing web session cookies (T1539) can be used to bypass MFA (T1556.003, under Valid Accounts), allowing attackers to maintain access without triggering additional authentication challenges.

Given the context of a sophisticated campaign like StellarParticle, the sequence of TTPs described aligns well with known tactics and techniques used by advanced threat actors. The use of stolen credentials for initial access, employing malware for persistence, and evading defenses by stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA are all plausible steps in a complex attack campaign.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Initial Access**: The use of stolen credentials and VPNs for initial access is a common and effective method.
- **Persistence**: Utilizing malware for WMI persistence and creating cron jobs are established techniques for maintaining access.
- **Defense Evasion**: Stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA is a sophisticated method to evade security controls.

**Conclusion**: Given the sophistication and the logical progression of the attack sequence described, it is plausible that the StellarParticle campaign would employ such tactics.
