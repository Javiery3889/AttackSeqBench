To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with the Lazarus Group, as well as the general tactics used by sophisticated threat actors in similar scenarios.

1. **Initial Access via Malicious Macros**: The use of malicious macros in job-themed documents to gain initial access is a common tactic. This method exploits the trust users have in Microsoft Office documents and their willingness to enable macros, which can then execute malicious code. This aligns with the "Phishing" technique under the Initial Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Collection of Information about Network Users and Settings**: After gaining initial access, collecting information about the network, including users and settings, is a logical next step. This is often done to understand the network layout, identify potential targets (such as high-privilege accounts), and plan the next stages of the attack. Tools like adfind, which is used for querying Active Directory, can be employed for this purpose. This action corresponds to the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Account Discovery" and "Domain Trust Discovery".

3. **Lateral Movement using Compromised Privileged Accounts**: Moving laterally within the network, especially using compromised privileged accounts, is a common technique used by threat actors to expand their access and control within the network. This can involve using the collected information to identify and exploit vulnerabilities or to use the compromised accounts to access other parts of the network. This aligns with the "Lateral Movement" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Use of Alternate Authentication Material" and "Exploitation of Remote Services".

Given these steps and the typical behavior of sophisticated threat actors like the Lazarus Group, it is reasonable to conclude that after achieving initial access, collecting information about network users and settings before moving laterally would be a plausible sequence of actions. This sequence allows the attackers to gather necessary intelligence, identify vulnerabilities, and plan their lateral movement effectively.
