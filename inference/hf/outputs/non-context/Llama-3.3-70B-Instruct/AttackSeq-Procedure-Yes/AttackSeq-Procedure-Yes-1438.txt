To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by ProjectM actors, including:
   - Developing a custom toolset for campaigns.
   - Registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services.
   - The question then inquires about the likelihood of these actors gathering victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before attempting to gain initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Reconnaissance (TA0043)**: Gathering information about potential victims, which can include gathering victim identity information.
   - **Resource Development (TA0042)**: This includes developing custom toolsets and registering domains, which can be used for various purposes, including phishing and hosting malicious content.
   - **Initial Access (TA0001)**: This involves gaining an initial foothold into a network, which can be achieved through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The development of a custom toolset and registration of domains are preparatory steps that can facilitate subsequent phases of an attack, including reconnaissance and initial access.
   - Reconnaissance is a critical phase where attackers gather information about their targets to plan effective attacks. Gathering victim identity information would be a logical step to tailor spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, making them more convincing and increasing the likelihood of success.
   - Spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks are targeted methods of gaining initial access, which are more effective when preceded by thorough reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: ProjectM actors prepare for their campaign by developing tools and registering domains, indicating a planned approach.
   - **Step 2**: As part of their campaign preparation, it is logical that they would engage in reconnaissance to gather information about their targets.
   - **Step 3**: Gathering victim identity information would be a key part of this reconnaissance, allowing for more targeted and effective spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context of a planned campaign involving custom tool development, domain registration, and targeted initial access methods, it is reasonable to conclude that gathering victim identity information would be a part of their reconnaissance efforts.

**Final Answer: A**
