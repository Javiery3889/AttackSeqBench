To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior described in relation to known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) associated with malware and cyber attacks, particularly focusing on the Korplug malware.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions that include:
   - Collecting metadata and content from various sources (mapped drives, removable media, network shared drives).
   - Communicating with Command and Control (C&C) servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports.
   - Performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The actions described can be mapped to several TTPs within the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
   - **Collection**: Gathering data from local and network sources aligns with techniques under the "Collection" tactic, such as "Data from Local System" (T1005) and "Data from Network Shared Drive" (T1039).
   - **Command and Control**: Using a custom protocol over non-standard ports for C&C communication is a technique under the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically "Application Layer Protocol" (T1071) and potentially "Uncommonly Used Port" (T1065).
   - **Exfiltration**: The act of sending data out of the network, especially when it involves encryption and compression, aligns with techniques under the "Exfiltration" tactic, such as "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" (T1048) and "Data Compression" (T1002), "Data Encryption" (T1022).

3. **Evaluating Korplug's Behavior**: Korplug is known to be a type of malware used in cyber espionage campaigns. Its capabilities include collecting sensitive information from compromised systems and communicating with C&C servers to exfiltrate stolen data. The use of custom protocols and encryption for C&C communication and data exfiltration is consistent with sophisticated malware designed to evade detection.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the behaviors described and the known capabilities of Korplug, it is plausible that after collecting data, Korplug would communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports before performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages. This sequence aligns with the tactics and techniques commonly used by sophisticated malware to maintain stealth and ensure the successful exfiltration of sensitive data.
