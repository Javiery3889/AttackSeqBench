To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Employing a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' for persistence**: This indicates an attempt by the malware (GHOLE) to maintain its presence on the compromised system. The use of scripts for persistence is a common technique, often associated with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Creating a mutex called 'woolger' to establish defense evasion mechanisms**: Mutexes are often used by malware to ensure that only one instance of the malware is running on a system at a time, which can be part of "Defense Evasion" tactics. The specific name 'woolger' might be associated with the CWoolger keylogger, suggesting a connection between the defense evasion mechanism and the keylogging functionality.

3. **GHOLE malware communicating with its C&C servers**: This action is associated with the "Command and Control" tactic, where the malware establishes communication with its command and control (C&C) servers to receive commands or send stolen data.

4. **CWoolger keylogger uploading keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers**: This is an action related to "Exfiltration" tactics, where the malware sends collected data (in this case, keystroke logs) back to the C&C servers.

Given the sequence of TTPs:
- The malware has already established persistence and defense evasion mechanisms.
- The specific mention of a keylogger (CWoolger) and its activity suggests that data collection (keystroke logging) is a goal of the malware.
- The establishment of communication with C&C servers is a logical next step for exfiltrating the collected data.

Therefore, considering the provided sequence of TTPs and the goals typically associated with malware operations (persistence, defense evasion, data collection, and exfiltration), it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing persistence and defense evasion, the malware would proceed with its primary objectives, which include communicating with C&C servers and exfiltrating collected data.
