To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described behavior following the establishment of persistence by the Grabit malware.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Grabit malware has already established persistence on a compromised system. This is typically achieved through techniques such as modifying registry entries to ensure the malware starts up whenever the system boots or a user logs in. The question then asks if it's likely for the malware to include a keylogger functionality to collect sensitive information like hostnames, application names, usernames, and passwords.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - **Persistence (T1484: Custom Command and Control Protocol)**: Modifying registry entries for startup configurations to maintain access to the system.
   - **Collection (T1056: Keylogging)**: Implementing keylogger functionality to capture keyboard inputs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Establishing Persistence**: This is a common initial step for many types of malware to ensure continued access to a compromised system. Modifying registry entries for startup configurations is a well-documented technique (T1060: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Keylogger Functionality**: Keylogging is a technique (T1056) used by attackers to capture keystrokes, which can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, usernames, and other confidential data. This aligns with the goals of many malware campaigns, which often aim to collect valuable data for financial gain or espionage.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware has established persistence, indicating its intent to remain on the system for an extended period.
   - **Step 2**: Given the goal of most malware to gather valuable data, implementing a keylogger is a logical next step to collect sensitive information without relying on more complex or detectable methods.
   - **Step 3**: The specific data mentioned (hostnames, application names, usernames, and passwords) are all potentially valuable for further exploitation, such as lateral movement within a network, identity theft, or selling on the dark web.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering the typical goals of malware and the logical progression of tactics after establishing persistence, it is reasonable to conclude that the Grabit malware would likely include a keylogger functionality to collect the mentioned types of data.

Final Answer: A
