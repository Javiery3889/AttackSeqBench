To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Employing obfuscation through scriptlet and inf files for defense evasion**: This is a technique used by attackers to evade detection by security systems. Obfuscation makes it difficult for security software to understand the intent of the code, thereby allowing malicious activities to go undetected. This technique falls under the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Backdoor function**: A backdoor is a type of malware that allows an attacker to access a network or system bypassing its security mechanisms. The presence of a backdoor indicates that the attacker has already gained some level of access to the system.

3. **Collect machine information and take screenshots during the discovery phase**: This action aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. During the discovery phase, attackers typically try to gather as much information as possible about the compromised system and network. Collecting machine information (such as operating system version, installed software, network configuration) and taking screenshots can provide valuable insights into the system's configuration, potential vulnerabilities, and the context in which the system is used.

4. **Sending this data to the C&C server for registration**: This step involves communicating with a Command and Control (C&C) server, which is a central server used by attackers to send commands to compromised systems and receive stolen data. The act of sending collected data back to the C&C server for registration is part of the "Command and Control" tactic, where the compromised system checks in with the C&C server, potentially to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

Given this sequence of events:
- The use of obfuscation techniques suggests the attacker is trying to remain stealthy.
- The deployment of a backdoor indicates the attacker has gained initial access and is looking to maintain it.
- The collection of machine information and screenshots is a logical next step for an attacker in the discovery phase, as it helps in understanding the environment and planning further actions.
- Sending the data to a C&C server for registration is consistent with how attackers manage and utilize compromised systems.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of an attack and the tactics typically employed by attackers, it is indeed likely that after employing defense evasion techniques, a backdoor would be used to collect machine information and take screenshots during the discovery phase, and then send this data to a C&C server for registration.
