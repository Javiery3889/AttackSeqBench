To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, as well as the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Reconnaissance and Exploitation**: The question starts with reconnaissance activities utilizing a "DOCKERGEDDON" function. This implies an initial phase of scanning and identifying vulnerable Docker APIs, which, when exploited, allow attackers to deploy malicious containers. This step aligns with the "Reconnaissance" and "Exploitation" phases of an attack, where attackers gather information about potential targets and exploit vulnerabilities to gain initial access.

2. **Compromising Websites for Malicious File Hosting**: After gaining access, the question suggests that attackers might leverage compromised websites to host malicious files. This action is consistent with the "Resource Development" phase, where attackers establish their infrastructure within the compromised environment. Hosting malicious files on compromised websites is a common tactic for attackers to stage their tools and payloads, making it easier to manage their operations without arousing suspicion.

3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities with Open-Source Tools**: The final part of the sequence involves exploiting vulnerabilities using open-source and offensive security tools. This is a typical step in the "Privilege Escalation" and "Defense Evasion" phases, where attackers use various tools to deepen their access, evade detection, and possibly move laterally within the network.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of events described is plausible. Given the context, it aligns well with common attack patterns. Attackers often use initial access to deploy additional tools, exploit more vulnerabilities, and expand their control within a compromised network. The use of compromised websites for hosting malicious files is a known tactic for facilitating these activities.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the sequence is unlikely. However, based on the typical progression of an attack, there's no inherent reason to believe that these steps wouldn't follow one another in a real-world scenario.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial exploitation of Docker APIs for deploying malicious containers is a feasible first step in an attack.
2. Utilizing compromised infrastructure (like websites) to host malicious files is a common practice for attackers to develop their infrastructure.
3. The subsequent exploitation of vulnerabilities with open-source tools aligns with typical post-exploitation activities aimed at consolidating access and evading detection.

**Final Answer**: A
