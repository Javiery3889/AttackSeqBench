To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with such attacks, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The initial access is gained by tricking users into downloading a fake app. This aligns with the "Trick" tactic under the "Phishing" technique (T1566) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary tricks a user into performing an action that benefits the adversary.

2. **Execution**: After gaining initial access, the next step mentioned involves the execution of a malware downloader. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic, specifically the "User Execution" (T1204) technique, where the adversary relies on the user to execute the malware.

3. **Persistence**: The question mentions the installation and execution of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) named 'IvizTech' as a service to maintain persistence. This aligns with the "Persistence" tactic, specifically the "Create or Modify System Process" (T1543) technique, where an adversary creates or modifies system processes to persist on the system.

Given these steps, the question asks whether it is likely that the malware downloader will execute binaries before the RAT is installed and executed as a service. 

- **Malware Downloaders** are typically used to download additional malware payloads from a command and control (C2) server or other locations. This action is part of the "Execution" tactic, specifically the "Malicious File" (T1204.002) sub-technique under "User Execution", where the adversary executes malicious files.

- The installation of a **RAT** like 'IvizTech' as a service is a method to achieve persistence, allowing the adversary to maintain access to the system.

Considering the logical sequence of an attack:
- **Initial Access** is gained.
- A **malware downloader** is executed to download additional payloads, which could include the RAT.
- The **RAT** is then installed and executed as a service to maintain **persistence**.

Therefore, it is logical and common in attack sequences for a malware downloader to execute binaries (which could include the RAT) before the RAT is installed and executed as a service. This sequence aligns with the tactics and techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework and represents a typical progression from initial access to establishing persistence.
