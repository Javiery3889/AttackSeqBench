To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of such a sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like Elfin.

1. **Scanning for Vulnerable Websites**: This is a common initial step for many cyber attacks, where attackers scan the internet for websites with known vulnerabilities. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Reconnaissance" tactic, specifically the "Active Scanning" technique (T1595).

2. **Exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via Spear-Phishing Emails**: The mention of exploiting a specific CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) suggests a targeted approach, possibly aligning with the "Initial Access" tactic. However, exploiting a vulnerability typically involves directly interacting with the vulnerable system or application, not necessarily through spear-phishing emails. Spear-phishing (T1566) is more commonly associated with delivering malware or tricking users into revealing sensitive information. The direct exploitation of a vulnerability like CVE-2018-20250 would more likely involve exploiting the vulnerability in a web application directly rather than through email.

3. **Deploying Malware Tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill**: The deployment of specific malware tools after initial access is gained is a common step in many attack sequences. Notestuk and Stonedrill are known malware tools associated with various threat actors, including Elfin. This step aligns with the "Execution" and "Persistence" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question mixes typical attack vectors and TTPs but does so in a way that might not perfectly align with the most common or efficient methods for exploiting vulnerabilities or delivering malware. However, the overall sequence from scanning, to exploiting a vulnerability (albeit the method of exploitation via spear-phishing might be unconventional for direct vulnerability exploitation), to deploying malware, does represent a plausible attack sequence, especially considering the adaptability and creativity of threat actors.

Therefore, considering the question asks if it is "likely" that Elfin would engage in this sequence of actions, and given that threat actors often combine different TTPs in innovative ways, the answer leans towards affirming the possibility, despite some unconventional elements in the described sequence.
