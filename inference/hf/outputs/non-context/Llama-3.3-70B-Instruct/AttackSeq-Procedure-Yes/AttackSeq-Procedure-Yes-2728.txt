To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Credential Access**: The use of the Responder tool to harvest credentials indicates that the attackers, in this case, the Lazarus group, are attempting to gain access to sensitive information that will allow them to move further into the network. This aligns with the Credential Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves techniques used to obtain account credentials, such as passwords, or other authentication material.

2. **Discovery Activities**: After gaining credentials, the next logical step for an attacker would be to understand the environment they have accessed. This involves Discovery activities such as File and Directory Discovery (T1204 in MITRE ATT&CK), which helps attackers to identify potential targets, such as sensitive files or directories, that they can exploit for further access or to achieve their objectives.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The use of WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) for lateral movement indicates the attackers are attempting to move through the network, exploiting gained credentials to access other systems. WMIC can be used to execute commands on remote systems, which aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The mention of using compromised routers to bypass network segmentation further supports this, as it indicates an attempt to evade security controls and move laterally within the network.

Given these steps, the sequence of TTPs described in the question follows a logical progression of an attack:

- **Credential Harvesting** (using Responder) to gain access.
- **Discovery** (such as file and directory discovery) to understand the environment and identify targets.
- **Lateral Movement** (using WMIC and compromised routers) to spread through the network.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after utilizing the Responder tool for credential access, the Lazarus group would indeed conduct discovery activities before attempting to achieve lateral movement. This sequence aligns with common attack patterns observed in the wild, where attackers seek to understand the network layout and identify potential vulnerabilities or targets before moving laterally.
