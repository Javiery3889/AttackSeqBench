To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described action based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes a scenario where a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) payload, specifically NanoCore RAT, is injected into a new process and remains in memory without being written to disk. This technique is used for defense evasion, as fileless malware can be harder to detect than traditional malware that writes files to the disk.
   - The attackers are using a free dynamic DNS service for command and control (C2) communications, with the domain chickenkiller.com.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Defense Evasion**: By keeping the RAT in memory, attackers aim to evade detection by traditional signature-based antivirus software that relies on scanning files on disk.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The use of a free dynamic DNS service for C2 communications is a common tactic. Dynamic DNS allows attackers to rapidly change the IP address associated with a domain name, making it difficult for defenders to block communications based on IP addresses alone. The domain chickenkiller.com, being associated with a free dynamic DNS service, suggests an attempt to maintain anonymity and flexibility in C2 operations.
   - **Likelihood of Connecting Back to the Control Server**: Given that the RAT has been successfully injected into a new process and is evading detection by staying in memory, the next logical step for the attackers would be to establish communication with their C2 server. This communication is necessary for the RAT to receive commands and exfiltrate data or for the attackers to further exploit the compromised system.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have successfully evaded detection by keeping the RAT in memory.
   - **Step 2**: They have injected the RAT into a new process, ensuring persistence and the ability to execute commands.
   - **Step 3**: The use of a dynamic DNS service for C2 communications indicates a plan for maintaining control over the compromised system.
   - **Conclusion**: Given these steps, it is logical that the attackers would connect the RAT back to its control server to leverage the access gained and to execute further malicious activities.

**Final Answer: A**
