To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT28, a well-documented advanced persistent threat group.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines an attack sequence that begins with spear-phishing campaigns aimed at harvesting credentials. This is a common initial access technique used by various threat actors, including APT28, to gain a foothold within a target network. The question then posits that after gaining initial access through credential harvesting, APT28 would exploit known vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers to move deeper into the victim's network during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned include:
   - **Spear-phishing** for initial access and credential harvesting (part of the Credential Access phase).
   - **Exploiting known vulnerabilities** in internet-facing servers, which is a technique often used for initial access but can also be part of the Lateral Movement phase if the vulnerabilities are within the network.
   - **Lateral Movement** into the victim's network.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - APT28 is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, often leveraging social engineering tactics like spear-phishing to gain initial access.
   - Once inside, exploiting known vulnerabilities is a common method for threat actors to move laterally within a network, especially if the vulnerabilities are not properly patched or if they provide access to sensitive areas of the network.
   - The described sequence aligns with common attack patterns observed in the wild, where initial access is gained through social engineering, followed by exploitation of vulnerabilities for deeper network access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials, which is a plausible initial access technique.
   - **Step 2**: With credentials in hand, exploiting known vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers is a logical next step for lateral movement, as it leverages existing network weaknesses.
   - **Step 3**: This approach allows APT28 to potentially gain deeper access into the network, aligning with the objectives of lateral movement.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the TTPs associated with APT28 and the common patterns of network intrusion, it is likely that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing, APT28 would use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers as part of moving deeper into victim networks during the Lateral Movement phase.
