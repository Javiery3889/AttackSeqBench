To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on known attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Persistence**: The question starts with Emissary Panda exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence. This aligns with the "Exploitation of Remote Services" (T1190) and "Web Shell" (T1505.003) techniques under the "Initial Access" and "Persistence" tactics, respectively. This initial step is plausible as webshells are commonly used for persistence and command and control (C2).

2. **Lateral Movement**: The next step involves lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit. Lateral movement is a tactic (TA0008) aimed at moving within a network. Using stolen credentials (T1003) is a technique under "Credential Access" that can facilitate lateral movement, and exploiting vulnerabilities like EternalBlue (a variant of Exploitation for Client Execution, T1203, and potentially related to Exploitation of Remote Services, T1190) for lateral movement is well-documented, especially in the context of ransomware and APT groups. This step is also plausible as it leverages known vulnerabilities and techniques for network traversal.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: Finally, the use of the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS falls under the "Command and Control" tactic (TA0011). Using a backdoor (T1219) for C2 communication is common, and HTTPS (T1071.001, Application Layer Protocol) is a frequently used protocol for C2 communication due to its ubiquity and the difficulty in distinguishing malicious from benign traffic.

Given these points, the sequence described:
- Begins with a plausible initial access and persistence method.
- Continues with a common lateral movement technique using both stolen credentials and an exploit, which is consistent with known APT tactics.
- Concludes with a typical method for establishing C2 communication.

Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with known attack patterns and the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
