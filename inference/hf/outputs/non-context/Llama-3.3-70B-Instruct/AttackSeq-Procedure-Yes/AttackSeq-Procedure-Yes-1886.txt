To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with the actions described, keeping in mind the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common practices of threat actors like FIN13.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions "lateral movement using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)" which aligns with the "Lateral Movement" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the technique "T1021: Remote Services" where WMI can be used for remote execution.
   - It also mentions the use of "custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE," which relates to the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically techniques involving web shells for command and control communication.
   - The question then asks if, after these actions, FIN13 would likely gather information on network and host configurations before staging collected data for fraudulent transactions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gathering Information:** After establishing access and command and control, threat actors typically gather information about the network and hosts to understand the environment, identify potential targets, and plan further actions. This aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which includes techniques for gathering information about the network (e.g., T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery) and hosts (e.g., T1018: Remote System Discovery).
   - **Staging Collected Data:** Before executing fraudulent transactions, staging collected data is a logical step. This involves collecting and organizing data from various sources, such as network shared drives, which can be part of the "Collection" tactic (e.g., T1025: Data from Removable Media, T1020: Automated Collection).

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Lateral Movement and Command & Control Establishment:** FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement and custom web shells for command and control, indicating they have established a foothold in the network and can execute commands remotely.
   - **Information Gathering:** As part of understanding the environment and planning further malicious activities, it is logical that FIN13 would gather information on network and host configurations. This is a common step after establishing access to plan and execute further tactics effectively.
   - **Data Staging for Fraudulent Transactions:** Before executing fraudulent transactions, FIN13 would need to collect and stage relevant data. This could involve gathering financial information, personal data, or other sensitive information from network shared drives or other sources.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context of the actions described (lateral movement and command & control establishment), it is highly plausible that FIN13 would gather information on network and host configurations as part of their tactics to understand the environment better. This information gathering would logically precede the staging of collected data for fraudulent transactions, as it would help in identifying valuable data sources and planning the exfiltration or misuse of the data.
