To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing with Trojanized Installation Executables**: The initial access vector described involves spear-phishing emails that contain trojanized installation executables. This is a common method used by attackers to gain initial access to a system. The executables, once run, would install malware on the victim's system.

2. **Execution Using Process Hollowing**: Process hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is spawned in a suspended state, and then its memory is unmapped and replaced with malicious code. This technique is used to evade detection since the malicious code is executed under the context of a legitimate process, making it harder for security software to detect.

3. **Discovery Activities**: After establishing a foothold, attackers typically engage in discovery activities to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and gather information that could be useful for further exploitation. This includes gathering system information and network views.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the likelihood of the scenario:

- **Initial Access** is achieved through spear-phishing, which is a common and effective method.
- **Execution using Process Hollowing** is a plausible next step to evade detection. Since the malware (TDrop2) is described in the context of being installed via trojanized executables, using process hollowing would be a sophisticated way to execute its payload without being easily detected.
- **Discovery Activities** such as gathering system information and network views are typical post-exploitation activities that follow initial access and execution. These activities help the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.

Considering these points, the sequence described aligns well with common attack patterns observed in the wild. The use of process hollowing as a means to execute malware without detection is consistent with the tactics used by sophisticated attackers to remain stealthy. Therefore, it is likely that after gaining initial access, the malware TDrop2 would use process hollowing to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities.
