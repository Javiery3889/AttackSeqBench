To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Exploitation of CVE-2015-5119**: This indicates the initial vector of attack, which is the exploitation of a known vulnerability to gain access to a system. The fact that a specific CVE is mentioned suggests a targeted or opportunistic attack leveraging a known exploit.

2. **Execution of a first-stage downloader**: This is a common tactic where the initial exploit leads to the download of additional malware. The purpose of a first-stage downloader is often to retrieve more sophisticated malware, in this case, the second stage PlugX file.

3. **Retrieval of the second stage PlugX file**: PlugX is a type of remote access trojan (RAT) known for its use in various cyber attacks. Its retrieval indicates the attacker's intention to establish a persistent presence on the compromised system.

4. **Connection to C2 domains starting with cdn[.]sanecat[.]com**: The establishment of communication with command and control (C2) servers is crucial for the malware to receive instructions and exfiltrate data. The mention of specific domains suggests that these are part of the malware's C2 infrastructure.

5. **Likelihood of communication with domains such as inocnation[.]com or oa[.]ameteksen[.]com**: The question essentially asks whether the Sakula malware, after establishing communication with the mentioned C2 domains, would also communicate with these additional domains as part of its command and control protocol.

Given the context:
- The Sakula malware is known to be associated with the PlugX RAT.
- The use of specific C2 domains (e.g., cdn[.]sanecat[.]com) suggests a structured C2 infrastructure.
- Malware often uses multiple C2 domains for redundancy and to evade detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial exploitation and download of PlugX suggest a sophisticated attack with potentially multiple components.
2. The communication with specific C2 domains indicates a pre-defined C2 infrastructure.
3. The use of additional domains (inocnation[.]com or oa[.]ameteksen[.]com) could be part of this infrastructure, providing redundancy or specific functionalities.

**Conclusion**: Given the structured approach of the attack and the common practice of using multiple C2 domains for resilience and evasion, it is plausible that the Sakula malware would communicate with additional domains as part of its command and control protocol.

**Final Answer: A**
