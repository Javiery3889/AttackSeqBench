To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involved.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: 
   - The question mentions ChromeLoader attempting to override macOS security technology with an animated image. This suggests an initial exploitation or social engineering tactic to gain access or control.
   - It then asks if CloudMensis is likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) restrictions. This implies a specific vulnerability exploitation technique to evade security controls.
   - Finally, it mentions using public cloud storage services for Command and Control (C2) communication, which is a method of maintaining access and controlling compromised systems.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - Initial Access: ChromeLoader using an animated image to override security.
   - Privilege Escalation or Defense Evasion: Exploiting CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions.
   - Command and Control: Using public cloud storage services for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exploiting CVE-2020-9934** is a specific technique that could be used for defense evasion or privilege escalation, aligning with the tactics of bypassing security controls.
   - **Using public cloud storage for C2** is a common tactic for maintaining access, as it can be less suspicious than traditional C2 methods.
   - CloudMensis is known for its ability to use various cloud services for its operations, which aligns with the described TTPs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: ChromeLoader's action suggests an initial phase of attack focused on gaining access or control.
   - **Step 2**: The exploitation of a specific CVE like CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing security restrictions is a plausible next step for an attacker looking to establish a foothold or escalate privileges.
   - **Step 3**: Utilizing public cloud storage for C2 communication is a tactic that aligns with modern attack techniques, providing a covert channel for command and control.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Given the context and the sequence of TTPs, it seems plausible that after an initial access attempt, an attacker would seek to establish a more stable foothold by bypassing security restrictions and then use covert methods for C2 communication. Therefore, the sequence described in the question aligns with known attack patterns.
