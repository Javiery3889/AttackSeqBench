To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the threat actor, FamousSparrow, in relation to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions by FamousSparrow, starting with the use of a custom version of Mimikatz for credential dumping, which falls under Credential Access (a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework). Following this, the question asks if it's likely for FamousSparrow to engage in system information collection (part of the Discovery tactic) before proceeding to read file contents and exfiltrate them.

2. **Identifying TTPs**:
   - **Credential Access**: Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery**: Collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.
   - **Collection**: Reading file contents.
   - **Exfiltration**: Sending the collected data to a Command and Control (C&C) server.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The use of Mimikatz for credential dumping is a common technique for gaining access to sensitive information.
   - Collecting system information during the Discovery phase is a logical next step after gaining credentials, as it helps the attacker understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and plan further actions.
   - Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to a C&C server are actions that would typically follow after the attacker has identified what information is valuable and accessible.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: FamousSparrow uses a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials, indicating an interest in accessing sensitive information within the system.
   - **Step 2**: After gaining access, it is logical for the attacker to want to understand the environment better, which involves collecting system information. This step is crucial for planning the next moves, such as identifying where valuable data might be stored.
   - **Step 3**: With the system information in hand, the attacker can then proceed to read file contents, focusing on files that are likely to contain valuable or sensitive data.
   - **Step 4**: Finally, exfiltrating the collected data to a C&C server allows the attacker to analyze it further or use it for malicious purposes.

Given this sequence of actions, it aligns well with common attack patterns where attackers seek to understand their environment (through Discovery) before collecting and exfiltrating specific data.

**Final Answer: A**
