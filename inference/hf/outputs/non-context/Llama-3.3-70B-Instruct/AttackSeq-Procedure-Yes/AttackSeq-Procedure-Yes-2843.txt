To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware like MSIL/Crimson.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where MSIL/Crimson, a type of malware, has successfully executed on a victim's machine. It first decodes and executes its downloader payload. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will use a custom TCP protocol to communicate with its command and control (C&C) servers before using its Remote Access Trojan (RAT) component for information exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Initial Execution**: MSIL/Crimson executes on the victim's machine.
   - **Downloader Payload Execution**: The malware decodes and executes its downloader payload, likely to fetch additional malicious components.
   - **Custom TCP Protocol for C&C Communication**: The potential use of a custom TCP protocol for communicating with C&C servers.
   - **RAT Component for Information Exfiltration**: The use of a RAT component for exfiltrating information from the victim's machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Execution and Downloader Payload**: This is a common initial step for many malware types, including MSIL/Crimson, to establish a foothold on the victim's system and download additional malicious tools.
   - **Custom TCP Protocol for C&C Communication**: Malware often uses custom protocols for C&C communication to evade detection. Using a custom TCP protocol is plausible as it allows the malware to communicate with its C&C servers in a way that might not be immediately detected by traditional security software.
   - **RAT Component for Information Exfiltration**: After establishing communication with C&C servers, using a RAT component for information exfiltration is a logical next step. RATs are designed to provide remote access to a machine, which can be used to exfiltrate sensitive information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial steps of executing on the victim's machine and downloading additional payloads are standard for malware.
   - The use of a custom protocol for C&C communication is a common tactic to avoid detection.
   - The deployment of a RAT for exfiltration purposes aligns with the goal of many malware campaigns, which is to steal sensitive information.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the common TTPs used by malware and the logical progression of establishing a foothold, communicating with C&C servers, and then exfiltrating information, the scenario described is plausible and aligns with known behaviors of sophisticated malware.
