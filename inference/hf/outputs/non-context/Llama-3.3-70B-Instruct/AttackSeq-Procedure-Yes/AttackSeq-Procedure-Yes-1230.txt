To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, particularly those associated with the Inception group, and the characteristics of the tools mentioned, such as the POWERSHOWER PowerShell backdoor.

1. **Initial Access via Exploitation of Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882):** The question starts with the exploitation of a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-11882) to gain initial access. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, which is a common initial access vector.

2. **Deployment of POWERSHOWER PowerShell Backdoor:** After gaining initial access, the deployment of a backdoor like POWERSHOWER is plausible. Backdoors are typically used to maintain access to a compromised system, allowing attackers to execute commands remotely. POWERSHOWER, being a PowerShell backdoor, fits into the category of tools that could be used post-exploitation for command and control (C2) purposes.

3. **Establishing Persistence:** The question mentions writing to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry for persistence. This is a common technique for maintaining access to a system after reboot or other events that might terminate the attacker's session. Writing a script to a directory like `%AppData%` and configuring it to run via a registry key is a method to ensure the backdoor (in this case, POWERSHOWER) is executed every time the user logs in or the system starts up.

Given these points, the sequence described aligns with common TTPs used by attackers:
- **Initial Access** through exploitation,
- **Execution** of a backdoor like POWERSHOWER for command and control,
- **Persistence** mechanisms to maintain access.

Therefore, it is plausible that after gaining initial access, the attackers would deploy a backdoor like POWERSHOWER and then establish persistence mechanisms to ensure continued access to the compromised system.
