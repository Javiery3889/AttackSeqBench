To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware is configured for Command and Control (C&C) communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This setup is tailored to each target with a specific domain and IP address combination. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration, employing tactics like avoiding detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied in the question involves:
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied through the configuration of C&C channels.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The use of HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol for communication between the malware and its C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration**: The act of transferring data from the victim's system to the attacker's system, potentially using scheduled uploads and randomized intervals to avoid detection.
   - **Evasion**: Attempting to avoid detection by using upload limits and randomized intervals.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the malware is indeed likely to communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration, using tactics to avoid detection. Given the context of customized C&C communication and the goal of exfiltrating data without being detected, this seems plausible. Malware often uses scheduled exfiltration and evasion techniques to minimize the risk of detection.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that the malware would not engage in such behavior, which seems less likely given the context. The setup described (custom C&C communication) suggests a level of sophistication that would likely include data exfiltration techniques to achieve the attacker's goals without being detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware's use of a custom cryptographic protocol for C&C communication indicates a level of sophistication.
   - The configuration of specific domain and IP address combinations per target suggests targeted attacks, which often involve data exfiltration.
   - Scheduled exfiltration with randomized intervals and adherence to upload limits are common evasion techniques used by sophisticated malware to avoid detection.
   - Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the malware would indeed communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration, employing evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: A**
