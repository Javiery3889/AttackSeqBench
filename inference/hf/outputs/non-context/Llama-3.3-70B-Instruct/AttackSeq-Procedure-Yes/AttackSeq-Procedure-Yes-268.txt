To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate its plausibility based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Exploitation of Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199)**: The attack starts with exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) using Microsoft Word documents. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution when a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Word file. This step is plausible as it aligns with known attack vectors where attackers use exploits to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Execution of Embedded .hta File Using mshta.exe**: After gaining initial access, the attack involves executing an embedded .hta (HTML Application) file using mshta.exe. This is a known technique (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment, and T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution) where mshta.exe is used to execute malicious code. This step is also plausible as it leverages a legitimate Windows utility to execute malicious code, which is a common tactic.

3. **Achieving Persistence via Scheduling a Task**: The attack achieves persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) file every 3 minutes. This technique (T1050 - New Service, and more specifically T1168 - Local Job Scheduling) involves creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence on the compromised system. The use of a name like 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' could be an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate Google update task, making this step plausible as well.

Given the sequence of TTPs:
- Exploiting a known vulnerability for initial access,
- Using a legitimate Windows utility (mshta.exe) to execute malicious code,
- Achieving persistence through scheduling a task that mimics a legitimate system task,

All these steps are consistent with known attack patterns and the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Therefore, the sequence described in the question forms a plausible attack scenario.
