To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of FIN13 following such a sequence based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with this threat actor group.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question involves two main TTPs:
   - Gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1059) and "System Information Discovery" (T1082), where attackers use native OS commands to gather system and network information.
   - Dumping LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process memory to obtain credentials. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique "OS Credential Dumping" (T1003), specifically targeting LSASS to extract credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **FIN13's Known TTPs**: FIN13 is known for sophisticated and targeted attacks, often involving reconnaissance, credential dumping, and lateral movement within a network. Their operations typically involve using native tools and binaries to blend in with normal network activity, making them harder to detect.
   - **Relevance of TTPs to FIN13**: The described sequence fits within the known modus operandi of FIN13. Reconnaissance is a crucial initial step for any targeted attack, allowing the attackers to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and plan their approach. Dumping LSASS process memory is a common technique used by various threat actors, including FIN13, to obtain credentials that can be used for further lateral movement or to gain elevated privileges.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: FIN13, like many sophisticated threat actors, would likely begin by gathering as much information as possible about the target network and hosts. Using native OS binaries for this purpose is consistent with their known tactics of minimizing the footprint of their operations.
   - **Step 2**: Obtaining credentials is a key objective for any attacker seeking to maintain access, move laterally within a network, or escalate privileges. Dumping LSASS process memory is an effective way to achieve this, as it can yield a wealth of credential information.
   - **Conclusion**: Given FIN13's sophistication and the described TTPs aligning with known attack patterns, it is plausible that they would engage in such a sequence of activities.

**Final Answer: A**
