To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, as well as the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Phishing**: The attack begins with an attempt to gather user credentials through phishing domains. This is a common initial access technique (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment, T1189 - Drive-by Compromise could also be relevant but is more about exploiting a vulnerability to gain access). Phishing is a well-documented method for attackers to obtain initial access to a network.

2. **Exploitation of Vulnerability**: After the initial attempt, the attack group exploits an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability. This action aligns with the "Exploitation of Remote Services" (T1210) technique, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in software or services that are remotely accessible. Given that Internet Explorer 8 is outdated and likely to have known vulnerabilities, this step is plausible as a means to gain initial access or further exploit an already compromised system.

3. **Securing Alternative Means of Persistence**: Once inside, attackers often seek to establish persistence (TA0003 - Persistence) to maintain access to the victim's systems even if the initial entry point is discovered and closed. This can involve a range of techniques, including creating new user accounts, modifying existing accounts, or installing malware that can survive system restarts.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common attack patterns:
- **Initial Access** through phishing or exploitation of a vulnerability.
- **Execution** and **Persistence** to maintain access and potentially move laterally within the network.

Therefore, it is plausible that after attempting to gather user credentials, an attack group would exploit a known vulnerability to gain a foothold and then secure alternative means of persistence on victim systems. This approach allows the attackers to ensure continued access even if the initial vulnerability is patched or the phishing attempt is detected.
