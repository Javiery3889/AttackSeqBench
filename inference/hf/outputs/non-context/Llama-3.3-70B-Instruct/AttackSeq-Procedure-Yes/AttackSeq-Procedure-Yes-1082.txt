To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the situation based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with the Lazarus Group and the use of Command and Control (C2) servers.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Lazarus Group, a well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, and their tactics after gaining access to a network. Specifically, it talks about moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts and then communicating with C2 servers.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned include:
   - Lateral Movement (TA0008) using compromised privileged accounts, which is a common technique used by threat actors to expand their control within a network.
   - Communication with C2 servers, which is essential for exfiltrating data, receiving further instructions, and maintaining access.

3. **Evaluating C2 Communication**: The question specifies the use of the HTTP protocol for C2 communication and mentions that the C2 servers are hosted on legitimate domains in various countries. This is a plausible tactic as it allows the malware to blend in with normal traffic, making it harder to detect. Using legitimate domains, possibly compromised or purchased for this purpose, adds another layer of stealth.

4. **Lazarus Group's TTPs**: The Lazarus Group is known for its sophisticated operations, including the use of custom malware and clever C2 communication strategies. They have been observed using various protocols for C2 communication, including HTTP, to evade detection.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the Lazarus Group's history of using sophisticated TTPs, including blending C2 traffic with legitimate traffic to avoid detection, and considering the common use of HTTP for C2 communication due to its ubiquity and the ease with which it can be disguised, the scenario described in the question is plausible.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The Lazarus Group is known for sophisticated and stealthy operations.
- Lateral movement using compromised accounts is a common technique for expanding access within a network.
- Using HTTP for C2 communication can help the malware blend in with normal network traffic.
- Hosting C2 servers on legitimate domains in various countries adds to the stealthiness of the operation.

**Final Answer**: A
