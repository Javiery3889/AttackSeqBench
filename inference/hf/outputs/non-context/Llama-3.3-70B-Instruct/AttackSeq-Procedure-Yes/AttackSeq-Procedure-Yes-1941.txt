To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the given information in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware.

1. **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers over HTTPS**: This indicates the malware is using a secure communication channel to interact with its command and control (C2) servers. HTTPS is often used for this purpose due to its encrypted nature, which helps in evading detection by network monitoring tools.

2. **Using a Custom Data Encoding Algorithm for Obfuscation**: This technique is used to hide the true nature of the data being transmitted. By encoding the data, the malware makes it more difficult for security tools to detect and analyze the communication.

3. **Exfiltrating Collected Data via the Second-Stage Payload Using a HTTP GET Request**: Data exfiltration is a common goal of many malware campaigns, where sensitive data is stolen and sent back to the attackers. Using a second-stage payload for this purpose suggests a more targeted approach, potentially after initial reconnaissance. However, using a HTTP GET request for exfiltration is less common for sensitive data due to its lack of encryption and the potential for easier detection compared to HTTPS.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after establishing secure communication and using obfuscation techniques, the malware would then use an insecure method (HTTP GET) for data exfiltration. This seems inconsistent with the initial efforts to maintain secrecy and evade detection through the use of HTTPS and data encoding.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the malware would likely continue to use secure and stealthy methods for data exfiltration, consistent with its initial communication methods. Given the use of HTTPS for C2 communication and a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation, it's more plausible that the malware would use a secure and possibly more stealthy method for exfiltrating data, rather than switching to an insecure HTTP GET request.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The malware establishes secure communication with its C2 servers.
2. It uses data obfuscation techniques, indicating a desire to avoid detection.
3. The question of exfiltration method arises, with a choice between a secure, stealthy method and an insecure, potentially more detectable method.

**Conclusion**: Given the initial steps taken by the malware to maintain secrecy and evade detection, it is less likely to switch to an insecure method like HTTP GET for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B**
