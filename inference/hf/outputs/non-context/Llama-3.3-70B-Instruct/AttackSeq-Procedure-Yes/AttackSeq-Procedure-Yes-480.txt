To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the behavior of Trickbot malware based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with it, as well as the general understanding of malware behaviors within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Trickbot malware connects to its Command and Control (C2) server, downloads, and executes its payload. It then inquires about the likelihood of Trickbot proceeding to delete files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives as part of its impact tactics.

2. **Understanding Trickbot's Behavior**: Trickbot is a type of malware known for its versatility and modular architecture. It is primarily used for banking trojan activities but has been observed to have additional capabilities such as spreading laterally within a network, stealing sensitive information, and acting as a dropper for other malware, including ransomware.

3. **Evaluating the TTPs**: The described action of connecting to a C2 server to download and execute a payload aligns with Trickbot's known behaviors, particularly under the tactics of "Command and Control" and "Execution" within the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The subsequent action of deleting files with specific extensions, especially in removable and network drives, could be associated with tactics aimed at causing impact, such as data destruction or disruption, which might not be the primary goal of Trickbot but could be a secondary effect or part of a broader campaign involving multiple malware components.

4. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after establishing C2 communication and executing its payload, Trickbot would proceed to delete files. Given Trickbot's modular nature and the variety of payloads it can deliver, this behavior is plausible, especially if the payload includes components designed for data destruction or if the attackers' goals include disrupting the victim's operations.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that file deletion is not a likely follow-up action for Trickbot after connecting to its C2 server and executing its payload. While Trickbot is primarily known for its role in stealing sensitive information and acting as a precursor to ransomware attacks, saying it would never engage in file deletion overlooks the potential for varied payloads and the evolving nature of malware campaigns.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Trickbot's primary functions include stealing banking information and serving as a dropper for other malware.
   - The malware's ability to connect to a C2 server and download additional payloads expands its potential impact.
   - The action of deleting files, particularly those with specific extensions in removable and network drives, could be part of a broader campaign to disrupt operations or prepare for a ransomware attack.
   - Given the versatility of Trickbot and the goals of its operators, it's reasonable to consider that it could be used for a variety of impact tactics, including file deletion.

**Final Answer: A**
