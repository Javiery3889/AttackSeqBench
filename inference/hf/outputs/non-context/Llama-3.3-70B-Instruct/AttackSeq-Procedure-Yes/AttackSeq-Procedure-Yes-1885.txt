To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned, in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with FIN13 exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques such as "Exploit Public-Facing Application" (T1190) or "Drive-by Compromise" (T1189), depending on the specifics of the exploitation.

2. **Establishment of Backdoors**: After gaining initial access, the use of passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server for command execution, fits into the "Persistence" and "Command and Control" tactics. Specifically, this could relate to techniques like "Application Window Discovery" (not directly, but as part of broader persistence and C2 efforts) and more directly "Server Software Component: Web Shell" (T1505.003) for the backdoor aspect.

3. **Persistence**: The question mentions the use of tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for establishing persistence. This aligns with the "Persistence" tactic, where techniques such as "Credential Dumping" (T1003) for the KeePass aspect and potentially "Scheduled Task/Job" (T1053) or "Systemd Service" (T1543) could be involved, depending on how SIXPACK operates.

Given this sequence:
- **Initial Access** is achieved through exploitation and deployment of malware.
- **Persistence** and **Command and Control** are then established through backdoors and other tools.

The question essentially asks if it's plausible that after gaining initial access, an attacker would use a passive backdoor before establishing further persistence mechanisms. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Access** via exploitation and malware deployment is a common first step.
2. Establishing a **passive backdoor** like BLUEAGAVE for command execution provides a covert channel for further instructions, which is a logical next step for maintaining access without immediate detection.
3. Using **additional tools for persistence** like SIXPACK and trojanized binaries ensures that even if the initial backdoor is discovered, access can be maintained through other means.

**Conclusion**: Given the logical progression from initial access, to establishing a covert command and control channel, and then ensuring persistence through multiple means, the sequence described is indeed plausible and aligns with known TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors.

**Final Answer: A**
