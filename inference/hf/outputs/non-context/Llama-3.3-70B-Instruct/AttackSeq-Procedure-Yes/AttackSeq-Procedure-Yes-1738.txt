To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the reconnaissance phase as described:

1. **Understanding the Attack Sequence**: The question outlines an attack sequence where the threat group TG1021 exploits internet-facing Windows IIS servers. This exploitation is achieved through deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability, which suggests a sophisticated and targeted approach.

2. **Reconnaissance Phase**: Before exploiting vulnerabilities, attackers typically conduct reconnaissance to gather information about their targets. This phase is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities, understanding the target's network architecture, and planning the attack.

3. **Tools Mentioned (SharpHound and PowerSploit)**: 
   - **SharpHound** is a tool used for gathering information about Active Directory environments. It can be used to map out the network, identify potential targets, and understand the relationships between different components within the network.
   - **PowerSploit** is a collection of PowerShell scripts that can be used for various tasks, including exploiting vulnerabilities, bypassing security controls, and gathering information. Loading these tools directly into memory (a technique known as "in-memory" or "fileless" malware) is a method used to evade detection by traditional signature-based security software.

4. **Likelihood of Reconnaissance with These Tools**: Given the sophisticated nature of the attack (use of deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability), it is plausible that the attackers would conduct thorough reconnaissance. The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit, especially when loaded directly into memory to avoid detection, aligns with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of sophisticated threat actors. These tools can provide valuable insights into the target's environment, helping the attackers to identify the most vulnerable points of entry and to plan their exploitation effectively.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering the sophistication of the attack and the utility of SharpHound and PowerSploit in gathering targeted information without being detected, it is reasonable to conclude that TG1021 would likely perform reconnaissance using such tools before attempting to exploit vulnerabilities.
