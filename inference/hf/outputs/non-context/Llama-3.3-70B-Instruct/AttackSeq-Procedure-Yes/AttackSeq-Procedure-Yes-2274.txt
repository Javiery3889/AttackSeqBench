To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the Regin malware based on known characteristics of advanced persistent threats (APTs) and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often associated with them, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Regin, a sophisticated malware, has already executed its payload to inject files into services.exe. This action suggests that the malware has gained a foothold within the system and is likely in the process of establishing persistence and escalating privileges.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves:
   - **Initial Access** and **Execution**: Regin has already gained access and executed its payload.
   - **Persistence**: Injecting files into services.exe suggests an attempt to maintain persistence.
   - **Discovery**: Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
   - **Collection**: Capturing screenshots and crawling through the file system for data collection.
   - **Command and Control**: Employing remote access Trojan capabilities implies communication with a command and control (C2) server for further instructions or exfiltration of data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This choice suggests that after establishing a foothold, Regin would indeed gather information about the system (processes and memory utilization) to understand its environment better. This reconnaissance is typical in APT attacks to identify valuable data, understand system defenses, and plan the next steps, which could include using its remote access capabilities for data collection. This behavior aligns with the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, such as "Discovery" (TA0007) and "Collection" (TA0009).
   - **Option B (No)**: This choice implies that Regin would not gather system information before proceeding with data collection and employing its remote access capabilities. While possible, this is less likely given the sophisticated nature of Regin and the typical modus operandi of APTs, which often involve thorough reconnaissance to maximize the effectiveness of their operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Regin's injection into services.exe indicates a sophisticated level of access and control.
   - Gathering system information (processes and memory utilization) is a logical next step for any advanced malware to understand its operating environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - The use of remote access Trojan capabilities for screenshot capture and file system crawling is consistent with the goals of data collection and exfiltration, typical of APTs.
   - The sequence described in Option A aligns more closely with the known TTPs of sophisticated malware like Regin.

**Final Answer: A**
