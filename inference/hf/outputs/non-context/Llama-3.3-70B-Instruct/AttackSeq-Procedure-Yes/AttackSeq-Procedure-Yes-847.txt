To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical cyber attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions taken by attackers after they have completed the discovery phase. The discovery phase typically involves gathering information about the target's systems, users, and data. This is often associated with the "Reconnaissance" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. After this phase, attackers usually attempt to gain access to the system, which could involve exploiting remote services. The question specifically asks if, after gaining knowledge, attackers are likely to exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence mechanisms on new systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exploiting Remote Services**: This action aligns with the "Exploitation of Remote Services" technique (T1210) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a method used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access or execute commands on a remote system. This technique is often used for initial access or lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the target environment. Exploiting remote services can be a means to achieve this, as it allows attackers to access and potentially control other systems on the network.
   - **Installing Additional Persistence Points**: Persistence (TA0003) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework refers to techniques that attackers use to maintain their presence within a compromised environment. Installing additional persistence points on new systems would be a logical step after achieving lateral movement, as it ensures continued access to those systems.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Attackers gather information about the target environment through the discovery phase.
   - **Step 2**: With this information, they identify potential vulnerabilities in remote services that could be exploited for initial access or lateral movement.
   - **Step 3**: They exploit these vulnerabilities to move laterally within the network, gaining access to new systems.
   - **Step 4**: Once they have access to these new systems, they would likely want to ensure they can maintain that access, which involves installing additional persistence points.

Given this sequence, it is logical that after gaining knowledge of the target environment, attackers would exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement as a means to spread through the network, and then install additional persistence points on the newly accessed systems to maintain their foothold.

**Final Answer: A**
