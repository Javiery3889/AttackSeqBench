To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) attributed to Hidden Cobra, a cyber threat group, and evaluate the plausibility of the described sequence.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: 
   - The question describes Hidden Cobra using the Bankshot malware implant for information collection during the reconnaissance phase.
   - It then asks if it's likely that the group would distribute Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Reconnaissance Phase**: Using Bankshot malware for information collection.
   - **Resource Development Phase**: Distributing Bankshot implants via a malicious domain that mimics a cryptocurrency-lending platform.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Reconnaissance** typically involves gathering information about the target. Using malware like Bankshot for this purpose is plausible as it can help in understanding the target's network and system vulnerabilities.
   - **Resource Development** involves creating, acquiring, or compromising resources (like domains, malware, etc.) that can be used in future attacks. Distributing malware through a malicious domain, especially one that appears legitimate (like a cryptocurrency-lending platform), is a common tactic to compromise additional systems or to expand within a network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Hidden Cobra's use of Bankshot for reconnaissance aligns with typical cyber threat group behaviors aimed at gathering intel on potential targets.
   - **Step 2**: The distribution of Bankshot via a malicious domain, especially one disguised as a cryptocurrency platform, is a tactic that leverages social engineering. This method can trick users into downloading or interacting with the malware, thereby expanding the group's reach and control.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context, it's reasonable to assume that after gathering information, a threat group like Hidden Cobra would seek to expand their capabilities or compromise more systems. Using a malicious domain that appears related to a cryptocurrency-lending platform could be an effective way to do so, especially considering the interest and activity around cryptocurrency.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the typical behaviors of cyber threat groups and the specific details provided about Hidden Cobra's actions, it is plausible that after using Bankshot for reconnaissance, the group would proceed to distribute the malware through deceptive means such as a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform as part of their resource development phase.
