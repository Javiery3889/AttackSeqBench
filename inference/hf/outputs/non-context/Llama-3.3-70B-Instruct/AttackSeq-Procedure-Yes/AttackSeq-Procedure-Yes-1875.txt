To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned, relating them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the behavior of the FIN13 group.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question mentions FIN13, a known threat actor group.
   - It talks about the use of utilities like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory. This is a technique used for credential dumping (T1003 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework), aiming to obtain credentials from the system.
   - The execution of passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution refers to the use of a backdoor (T1219) for establishing persistence and possibly for command and control (C2) communications.
   - The question asks if it's likely that FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks. This involves exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) and using a web shell (T1100) for initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - FIN13 is known for sophisticated attacks, often involving financial fraud. Their TTPs include credential dumping, backdoor installation, and exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
   - The use of ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE indicates a level of sophistication and intent to maintain access within a network.
   - Establishing initial access through exploiting external servers and deploying web shells is a common approach for many threat actors, including FIN13, as it provides a straightforward path into a network.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: FIN13's known TTPs include credential dumping and backdoor installation, indicating a focus on gaining and maintaining access to sensitive systems.
   - **Step 2**: The use of specific tools like ProcDump and backdoors such as BLUEAGAVE suggests a pattern of behavior focused on stealthy, persistent access.
   - **Step 3**: Given the group's sophistication and goals, exploiting external servers and deploying web shells aligns with common initial access TTPs used by threat actors to gain a foothold in victim networks.
   - **Step 4**: Considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the mentioned activities (credential dumping, backdoor installation, and potential exploitation of public-facing applications) are all part of a broader strategy to infiltrate and persist within a network.

**Final Answer: A**
