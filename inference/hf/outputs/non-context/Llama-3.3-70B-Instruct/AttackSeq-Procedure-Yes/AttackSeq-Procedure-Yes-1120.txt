To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that might be employed by an adversary like LYCEUM, considering the context provided:

1. **Initial Access and Credential Access**: The use of the Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 script to decrypt passwords stored in the RDCMan configuration file indicates that the adversary has already gained initial access to the system and is now focusing on credential access (T1589: Credentials in Files). This action suggests they are looking to expand their access within the network.

2. **Credential Access to Spearphishing**: After obtaining credentials, especially those that could provide elevated access or access to sensitive information, it's a common TTP for adversaries to use this information for further malicious activities. This could include using the compromised accounts for spearphishing operations. Spearphishing (T1566: Phishing) is a technique often used to trick specific individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions that aid the adversary's goals.

3. **Targeting HR and IT Personnel**: HR and IT personnel are high-value targets for spearphishing because they often have access to sensitive information and systems. HR personnel may have access to personal data and organizational charts, which can be used to craft more targeted phishing campaigns. IT personnel, on the other hand, may have administrative access to critical systems, making their credentials particularly valuable for lateral movement and further exploitation.

4. **Gathering Information and Access**: The goal of targeting these personnel would be to gather more information about the organization, its structure, and its security posture, as well as to gain further access to systems and data. This aligns with the tactics of reconnaissance (TA0043: Reconnaissance) and credential access, which are foundational to many cyber attacks.

Given these considerations, it is logical to conclude that after obtaining credentials, an adversary like LYCEUM would indeed use compromised accounts for further spearphishing operations targeting HR and IT personnel. This approach would help them gather more information and gain deeper access within the targeted environment, which is consistent with common adversary TTPs as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
