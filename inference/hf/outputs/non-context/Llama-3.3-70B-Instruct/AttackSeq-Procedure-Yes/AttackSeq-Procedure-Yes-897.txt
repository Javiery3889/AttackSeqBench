To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario presented:

1. **Delivery of KerrDown via malicious Microsoft Office documents or RAR archives**: This is a common TTP used by attackers. Malicious Office documents, especially those with macros, are frequently used to deliver malware. The use of RAR archives for DLL side-loading is another known technique to evade detection and deliver payloads.

2. **Inclusion of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros**: This is a social engineering tactic often used to trick victims into enabling macros, which are disabled by default in most modern Office applications due to security concerns. The presence of an image or any form of instruction that prompts the user to enable macros is a common technique to increase the success rate of the initial infection vector.

3. **Use of base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture**: Once the macros are enabled, or the malicious archive is executed, using base64 encoded blobs to deliver and execute the payload is a technique that can help evade detection by traditional signature-based security controls. The use of system architecture-specific payloads ensures that the correct version of the malware is executed on the victim's machine, maximizing the chances of successful infection.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question aligns with known TTPs used in malware campaigns:

- **Social Engineering**: The use of an image to instruct the victim to enable macros is a form of social engineering aimed at increasing the likelihood of successful infection.
- **Delivery and Execution**: The methods described for delivering and executing the malware (via Office documents or RAR archives and using base64 blobs) are consistent with tactics used to evade detection and ensure the malware is properly executed on the target system.

Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that the Office document would contain an image instructing the victim to enable macros, followed by the use of base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.
