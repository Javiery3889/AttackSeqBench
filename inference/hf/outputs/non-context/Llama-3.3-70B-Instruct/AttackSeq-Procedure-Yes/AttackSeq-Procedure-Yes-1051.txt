To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) attributed to the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group and evaluate the plausibility of the described sequence.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of TTPs that includes:
   - Compromising trusted commercial network resources on a global scale to support attack infrastructure.
   - Using small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code.
   - Employing techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.

2. **Understanding the TTPs**:
   - **Compromising trusted commercial network resources**: This is a common initial step for many APT groups, providing them with the infrastructure needed to launch further attacks.
   - **Using small downloaders and zero-day exploits**: This technique is used to gain initial access or to move laterally within a network, executing malicious code to establish a foothold.
   - **Signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion**: This is a technique used to make malicious software appear legitimate, evading detection by security software that trusts digitally signed applications.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The sequence described starts with establishing a support infrastructure, which is plausible as APT groups often need robust infrastructure for their operations.
   - The use of small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code is a common method for gaining access to targeted systems, fitting well within the initial stages of an attack.
   - Signing backdoors with digital certificates is a sophisticated technique for defense evasion, which aligns with the tactics of advanced threat actors seeking to maintain access without detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Establishing Infrastructure**: The Darkhotel APT compromising commercial network resources globally aligns with known APT tactics to establish robust and widespread infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access and Execution**: Using small downloaders and zero-day exploits is a known method for initial access and execution, fitting the described sequence.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Employing digital certificates to sign backdoors is a sophisticated evasion technique, consistent with the goal of maintaining access without detection.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the tactics and techniques described, the sequence outlined in the question is consistent with known APT behaviors, particularly for a group like Darkhotel that has been known for sophisticated and targeted attacks. The use of compromised infrastructure, followed by exploitation techniques, and then evasion methods like digitally signing backdoors, forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence.
