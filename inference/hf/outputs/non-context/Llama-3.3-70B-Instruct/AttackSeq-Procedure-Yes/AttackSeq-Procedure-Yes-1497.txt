To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on known behaviors of malware and attacker tactics.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing**: The attack begins with DarkHydrus delivering spear-phishing emails. This is a common initial access tactic (TA0001) where attackers use social engineering to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or links. The use of malicious Excel Web Query files is a creative way to bypass traditional defenses, as these files can execute queries that download and run malicious code.

2. **Execution of RogueRobin PowerShell Payload**: After initial access, the execution of a PowerShell payload (T1059.001) is a technique often used by attackers for its versatility and ability to execute code directly in memory, potentially evading traditional signature-based detection. RogueRobin is known for its ability to evade detection, suggesting it employs anti-sandbox techniques and possibly code obfuscation to avoid being detected by security software.

3. **Evasion Techniques**: The use of sandbox detection techniques and obfuscation (Evasion, TA0005) is a common approach for malware to avoid being detected. Malware can use various methods to detect if it's running in a sandbox environment and alter its behavior to avoid detection. Obfuscation makes it harder for security tools to understand the code's intent, delaying or preventing detection.

4. **Establishing Persistence**: Creating and executing a script like OneDrive.ps1 on user login (Persistence, TA0003) is a method to maintain access to the victim's system. By leveraging a legitimate service or process (in this case, possibly masquerading as a script related to OneDrive), the malware can blend in with normal system activity, making it harder to detect.

Given this sequence of events:
- The initial access method is plausible and aligns with known spear-phishing tactics.
- The execution of a PowerShell payload with evasion capabilities is consistent with modern malware behaviors.
- The use of evasion techniques such as sandbox detection and obfuscation is a common practice among sophisticated threats.
- Establishing persistence through a script executed at login ensures continued access, which is a typical goal of such attacks.

Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques described, it is likely that the RogueRobin PowerShell payload could evade defenses and establish persistence as described.
