To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the situation based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically used by attackers, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Discovery**: The use of a Cobalt Strike beacon indicates that the attackers have already gained initial access to the network. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that can be used for various purposes, including reconnaissance and lateral movement. The fact that they have used it to discover and map the internal network suggests they are in the "Discovery" phase (TA0007) of the attack lifecycle, where they aim to gather information about the environment.

2. **Credential Collection**: Collecting administrative-level credentials is a significant step, often associated with the "Credential Access" tactic (TA0006). Having these credentials allows attackers to move laterally within the network, as they can authenticate to various systems and services.

3. **Lateral Movement**: Given that the attackers have both the necessary tools (Cobalt Strike) and credentials, the next logical step would be to move laterally (TTP: Lateral Movement, T1021) across the infrastructure. This involves using the collected credentials to access other systems, potentially compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers. This action aligns with the attackers' goal of expanding their control within the network.

4. **Objective**: The objective of such actions is often to achieve a strategic position within the network from which the attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data, disrupt operations, or establish a persistent presence for future malicious activities.

Considering these points, the sequence of TTPs described in the question—discovery, credential collection, and the capability to move laterally—strongly suggests that the attackers would indeed attempt to compromise numerous workstations and target internal hosts and servers to achieve their objectives.
