To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where WastedLocker ransomware is deployed. It mentions the use of PsExec for stopping services and disabling Windows Defender, which falls under the Defense Evasion phase of an attack. The question then asks if it's likely that the ransomware will proceed to encrypt computers and servers, causing disruption and demanding a ransom, which would be part of the Impact phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied through the deployment of WastedLocker.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The use of PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender. This technique is used to evade detection by the system's security measures.
   - **Impact**: The potential encryption of computers and servers, and the demand for a ransom.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of PsExec to disable security services like Windows Defender is a common technique used by attackers to pave the way for further malicious activities without being detected.
   - WastedLocker is known to be a ransomware strain that encrypts files and demands ransom, which aligns with the actions described in the Impact phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The deployment of WastedLocker ransomware indicates an intent to cause harm through file encryption and ransom demands.
   - **Step 2**: The use of PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender suggests an attempt to evade security measures, creating an environment conducive to the ransomware's operation.
   - **Step 3**: Given the nature of WastedLocker and the actions taken during the Defense Evasion phase, it is logical to conclude that the next steps would involve the encryption of files and a demand for ransom, fitting the description of the Impact phase.

5. **Final Answer**: Based on the analysis and the typical behavior of ransomware like WastedLocker, it is reasonable to conclude that after evading defenses, the ransomware would proceed to encrypt computers and servers, causing disruption and demanding a ransom.

Final Answer: A
