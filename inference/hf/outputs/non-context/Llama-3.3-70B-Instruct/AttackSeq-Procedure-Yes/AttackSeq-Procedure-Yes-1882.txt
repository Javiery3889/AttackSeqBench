To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that FIN13, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, might employ. The sequence involves:

1. **Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives**: This action aligns with the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Data from Network Shared Drive" technique (T1025). It indicates the adversary is interested in gathering sensitive information.

2. **Archiving it locally or remotely using utilities and libraries**: This step can be associated with the "Collection" and "Exfiltration" tactics, preparing the data for potential exfiltration by compressing or encrypting it (T1560 - Archive Collected Data).

3. **Using proxies for communication and command and control**: This is related to the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically using proxies (T1090 - Proxy) to hide the true source of the command and control traffic, making it harder to detect and attribute the activity to the adversary.

4. **Exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools**: This directly relates to the "Exfiltration" tactic, using web services (T1567) as a means to transfer data out of the target network. Web shells and JSP (Java Server Pages) tools can be used to create a covert channel for data exfiltration.

Given these steps, the question essentially asks if FIN13 would use proxies for command and control before exfiltrating the collected data. 

FIN13, like many sophisticated threat actors, often employs tactics to evade detection, including the use of proxies for command and control. This behavior is consistent with the TTPs associated with advanced threat groups aiming to maintain access, gather intelligence, and exfiltrate sensitive data without being detected.

Therefore, considering the typical behaviors of APT groups like FIN13 and the described sequence of actions, it is reasonable to conclude that FIN13 would likely use proxies for communication and command and control before exfiltrating the data. This approach helps in maintaining stealth and complicates the tracking of their activities.
