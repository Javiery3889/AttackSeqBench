To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Exploitation**: APT3 exploits a zero-day vulnerability disclosed in the Hacking Team data leak. This suggests an initial access technique where the adversary leverages a previously unknown vulnerability to gain access to a system.

2. **Delivery Method**: The exploitation is done via phishing emails to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor. This indicates the use of social engineering (phishing) as a technique to trick users into opening malicious emails that deliver malware (SHOTPUT backdoor).

3. **Malware Deployment**: The SHOTPUT backdoor is delivered. Backdoors are types of malware that allow attackers to access a system remotely, bypassing normal security mechanisms. The fact that it's a backdoor suggests that it would need to communicate with a Command and Control (CnC) server to receive further instructions.

4. **Communication with CnC**: The question mentions that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses. Hardcoding CnC addresses into malware is a common technique used by attackers to ensure their malware can communicate with their CnC servers without needing additional configuration.

5. **GH0ST RAT and APT18**: The question also mentions GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18's phishing campaign, calling out to an APT18 CnC address. This introduces another piece of malware (GH0ST RAT) and another threat actor (APT18), indicating a separate but similar operation where malware is used to communicate with a CnC server controlled by APT18.

Given this analysis, the question essentially asks if it's plausible for two different backdoors (SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT), possibly deployed by different threat actors (APT3 and APT18), to communicate with their respective CnC addresses after being delivered through phishing campaigns.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- **Plausibility of Separate Operations**: It's entirely plausible for different threat actors to operate independently, using similar TTPs (like phishing and backdoors) but targeting different systems or objectives.
- **Use of Hardcoded CnC Addresses**: The use of hardcoded CnC addresses in malware is a known technique, making it likely that SHOTPUT would communicate with its designated CnC servers.
- **Concurrency of Attacks**: The cybersecurity landscape is complex, with multiple threat actors operating simultaneously. Thus, it's possible for different groups to conduct operations independently, including communicating with their respective CnC servers.

**Final Answer**: A
