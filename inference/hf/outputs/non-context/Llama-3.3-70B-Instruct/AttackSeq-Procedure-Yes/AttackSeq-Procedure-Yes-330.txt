To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the skip-2.0 backdoor employing multiple hooks in the sqllang.dll service for its purposes.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by the skip-2.0 backdoor. The backdoor first achieves persistence through DLL hijacking, leveraging a vulnerability to load at system startup via the Windows SessionEnv service. Following this, it's suggested that the backdoor might employ multiple hooks in the sqllang.dll service. The purpose of this action would be to bypass authentication and evade defenses, ultimately facilitating the Inner-Loader component's process discovery targeting MSSQL Server.

2. **Identifying TTPs**:
   - **Persistence**: Achieved through DLL hijacking, exploiting a vulnerability to load at system startup.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Possibly through employing multiple hooks in sqllang.dll.
   - **Discovery**: Process discovery targeting MSSQL Server by the Inner-Loader component.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The use of DLL hijacking for persistence is a known and effective method for malicious actors to ensure their malware loads at system startup.
   - Employing hooks in system or application libraries (like sqllang.dll for MSSQL Server interactions) is a common technique for intercepting and manipulating system calls, which could be used for bypassing authentication or evading detection.
   - The specific targeting of MSSQL Server by the Inner-Loader for process discovery suggests a focused interest in database systems, possibly for data exfiltration or further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The skip-2.0 backdoor achieves persistence, indicating a desire to maintain access to the system.
   - **Step 2**: To effectively utilize this access, especially in a targeted environment like an MSSQL Server, evading defenses and bypassing authentication would be crucial.
   - **Step 3**: Employing multiple hooks in sqllang.dll could provide the backdoor with the necessary capabilities to intercept and manipulate database-related system calls, aligning with the goal of targeting MSSQL Server.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs described, it is plausible that the skip-2.0 backdoor would employ such tactics to achieve its objectives. The use of hooks in sqllang.dll for defense evasion and authentication bypassing fits within the narrative of a sophisticated, targeted attack aiming to interact with MSSQL Server without detection.
