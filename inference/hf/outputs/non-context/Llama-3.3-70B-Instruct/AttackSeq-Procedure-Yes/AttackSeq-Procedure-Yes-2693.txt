To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate their plausibility in the context of a cyber attack, particularly focusing on the MITRE ATT&CK framework which categorizes adversary behaviors into tactics.

1. **Initial Access and Defense Evasion**: The question starts with the deployment of DarkComet (a type of malware) and a credential dumping tool. This implies the attacker has already gained initial access to the system. The use of credential dumping tools aligns with the "Credential Access" tactic (TA0006) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Before or after gaining credentials, an attacker might indeed use defense evasion techniques, such as bypassing logging mechanisms, to remain undetected. Using PowerShell commands for defense evasion (e.g., modifying system logs, disabling security tools) is a common technique (T1562.003 - Modify System Logs, T1562.001 - Disable or Modify Tools) that aligns with the "Defense Evasion" tactic (TA0005).

2. **Command and Control (C2)**: After establishing a foothold and potentially gaining credentials, the next logical step for an attacker would be to establish command and control communications. This is crucial for executing further tactics, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or additional payload delivery. Tools like POSHC2 (a PowerShell-based C2 framework) and Quasar RAT (a remote access trojan) are used for this purpose, fitting into the "Command and Control" tactic (TA0011).

Given this analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common adversary TTPs as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
- **Initial Access** and **Credential Access** are achieved through the deployment of malware and credential dumping tools.
- **Defense Evasion** tactics, such as bypassing logging, are used to maintain access without detection.
- **Command and Control** is established using specialized tools for remote access and control.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of a cyber attack and the tactics typically employed by adversaries, the sequence described is plausible.
