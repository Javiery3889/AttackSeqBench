To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like FamousSparrow.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the use of `cmd.exe` to execute the SparrowDoor backdoor for execution.
   - Following execution, the sequence involves collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.
   - The final step mentioned is dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Execution**: Utilizing `cmd.exe` to execute SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Discovery**: Collecting system information and probing files.
   - **Credential Access**: Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The sequence starts with gaining execution on a system through the SparrowDoor backdoor, which is a common initial step for many attacks, providing the attacker with a foothold in the network.
   - After establishing a foothold, it's logical for an attacker to proceed with the Discovery phase to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and gather information that could be useful for further exploitation. This includes collecting system information and probing files, which aligns with the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Discovery tactic.
   - Finally, dumping credentials using a tool like Mimikatz is a well-documented TTP for achieving Credential Access. This step is consistent with the goals of many threat actors, including FamousSparrow, who would seek to expand their access within a compromised network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Execution via SparrowDoor backdoor provides initial access.
   - **Step 2**: Discovery activities (collecting system information and probing files) are typical post-exploitation actions aimed at informing the attacker about the environment and potential vulnerabilities or targets.
   - **Step 3**: Credential Access through Mimikatz or similar tools is a common method for escalating privileges and moving laterally within a network.

Given the logical progression from initial access to information gathering and then to credential theft, the sequence described in the question aligns well with known TTPs used by threat actors.

**Final Answer: A**
