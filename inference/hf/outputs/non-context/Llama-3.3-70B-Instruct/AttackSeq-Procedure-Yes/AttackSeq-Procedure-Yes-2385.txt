To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and compare them with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with the Dark Seoul attackers, as well as the general tactics used in cyber attacks.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The initial step mentioned involves gathering system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings. This is a common initial phase in many cyber attacks, where attackers gather as much information as possible about the target system to identify vulnerabilities and plan the next steps. This aligns with the "Reconnaissance" phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Active Scanning" (T1595) and "Gather Victim Host Information" (T1592).

2. **Initial Access**: The question then asks about the likelihood of using spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access. Spear-phishing is a highly targeted form of phishing that involves sending emails to specific individuals or groups, often using information gathered during reconnaissance to make the emails more convincing. Delivering a trojanized software executable via spear-phishing emails is a common tactic for gaining initial access to a system. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the technique "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1566) or "Spearphishing Link" (T1566), and "Supply Chain Compromise" (T1195) if the software itself is compromised.

3. **Dark Seoul Attackers**: The Dark Seoul attacks were a series of cyberattacks that occurred in 2013, primarily targeting South Korean banks and broadcasting companies. While the specific TTPs used by the Dark Seoul attackers might not be fully detailed in the question, the use of spear-phishing and trojanized software for initial access is consistent with sophisticated, targeted cyber attacks.

Given these points, the sequence described—reconnaissance followed by the use of spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized software executable for initial access—is a plausible and common attack sequence. It aligns with known TTPs used in targeted cyber attacks, including those that might be attributed to sophisticated threat actors like the ones behind the Dark Seoul attacks.
