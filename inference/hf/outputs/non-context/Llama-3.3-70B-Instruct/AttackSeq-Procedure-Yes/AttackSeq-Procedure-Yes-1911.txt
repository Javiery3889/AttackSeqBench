To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the actions of APT10, a known advanced persistent threat group.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where APT10 has already gained higher-level permissions, such as domain administrator, through privilege escalation using compromised Managed Service Provider (MSP) credentials. The next step in question is whether APT10 would likely deploy tools like mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping by exploiting DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller.

2. **Identifying TTPs**:
   - **Privilege Escalation**: APT10 has already escalated privileges to domain administrator level.
   - **Credential Dumping**: The potential next step involves using tools like mimikatz or PwDump for dumping OS credentials.
   - **DLL Load Order Hijacking**: This is a technique that could be used to execute malicious code, potentially for credential dumping, by exploiting the way Windows loads DLLs.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **APT10's Known TTPs**: APT10 is known for its sophisticated attacks, including privilege escalation and credential dumping. They have been observed using various tools and techniques to achieve their goals, including exploiting vulnerabilities and using legitimate administrative tools for malicious purposes.
   - **Credential Dumping Tools**: mimikatz and PwDump are well-known tools for credential dumping. mimikatz can extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN code, and kerberos tickets from memory, while PwDump is used to extract hashed passwords from the Windows SAM database.
   - **DLL Load Order Hijacking**: This technique can be used to load malicious DLLs into legitimate processes, potentially allowing for the execution of malicious code, such as credential dumping tools, in the context of a privileged process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Likelihood of Using Credential Dumping Tools**: Given APT10's goals, which often include gaining and maintaining access to sensitive information, using tools like mimikatz or PwDump for credential dumping aligns with their known objectives.
   - **Exploiting DLL Load Order Hijacking**: This technique provides a plausible method for executing these tools in a way that could evade detection, especially if APT10 aims to maintain access without being detected.
   - **Context of Domain Controller**: Targeting a domain controller with such techniques would provide APT10 with access to a rich source of credentials, given the central role domain controllers play in Windows Active Directory environments.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering APT10's known TTPs, the objectives of credential dumping, and the effectiveness of exploiting DLL load order hijacking for executing malicious code, it is reasonable to conclude that APT10 would likely deploy such tools and techniques to achieve their goals.
