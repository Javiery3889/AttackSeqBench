To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the behavior of CosmicDuke malware based on the provided information and general knowledge about malware tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: 
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke malware has already completed the Collection phase by gathering information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
   - It then asks if CosmicDuke is likely to upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Understanding CosmicDuke**:
   - CosmicDuke is known as a type of malware that is capable of various malicious activities, including data theft and exfiltration.
   - Malware like CosmicDuke typically follows a pattern of infection, data collection, and then exfiltration of the collected data to command and control (C2) servers or other designated locations for further analysis or exploitation.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The Collection phase involves gathering sensitive information, which CosmicDuke has done using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
   - The Exfiltration phase involves transferring the collected data from the victim's system to the attacker's servers. Using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) with stored login credentials is a plausible method for exfiltrating data, as it allows for the transfer of files over the internet.
   - Contacting live remote sites could be part of the exfiltration process, either to send the data directly or to receive further instructions.

4. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - Given the capabilities of CosmicDuke and the typical behavior of malware in the Exfiltration phase, uploading collected information to remote servers via FTP and contacting live remote sites aligns with expected TTPs for data exfiltration.
   - The use of stored login credentials for FTP access suggests a level of premeditation and capability to leverage existing access methods for data exfiltration, which is consistent with sophisticated malware operations.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   1. CosmicDuke has collected sensitive information.
   2. The next logical step for the malware would be to exfiltrate this data.
   3. Using FTP with stored login credentials is a viable method for exfiltration.
   4. Contacting remote sites could be necessary for exfiltration or for receiving further instructions.

6. **Final Evaluation**:
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware like CosmicDuke and the described sequence of TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that CosmicDuke would indeed likely upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

Final Answer: A
