To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers have already gained initial access to hosts. This is typically achieved through various means such as exploiting vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or social engineering tactics. The use of tools like Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package for remote control and creating new local accounts suggests a combination of network scanning, credential exploitation, and possibly lateral movement techniques.

2. **Remote Control and Account Creation**: The use of Radmin and PushVNC package indicates that the attackers are using remote access tools to control the compromised systems. Creating new local accounts is a technique used for persistence, allowing attackers to maintain access even if initial entry points are closed.

3. **Downloading Malware and Clearing System Events**: The question mentions the use of AutoExe1.bat to download malware and clear system events. Downloading malware can be associated with several tactics, including executing malicious code, which is a common step after initial access to further the attack's objectives. Clearing system events (log clearing) is a technique used to evade detection by removing traces of malicious activity from system logs.

Given this sequence of TTPs:
- **Initial Access** has been achieved.
- **Persistence** is established through the creation of new local accounts and possibly through the use of remote access tools.
- The next logical steps for an attacker would be to **execute malicious code** (by downloading malware) to further their objectives, which could include data exfiltration, lateral movement, or establishing command and control (C2) channels.
- **Evading detection** by clearing system events is a common practice to avoid being detected by security monitoring tools and personnel.

Considering these points, the use of AutoExe1.bat to download malware and clear system events aligns well with the post-initial access activities of an attacker aiming to further compromise the system, achieve their objectives, and avoid detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The attackers have gained initial access and established a form of persistence.
2. The next steps involve further compromising the system, which could include downloading additional malware.
3. Clearing system events is a logical step to avoid detection after downloading and executing malware.

**Final Answer: A**
