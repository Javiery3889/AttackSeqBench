To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Energetic Bear, a group known for targeting energy and industrial sectors.

1. **Identify the Threat Actor and Targets**: Energetic Bear, also known as Dragonfly, is a threat actor group known for its interest in the energy sector, particularly in compromising industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) environments. Their targets often include companies involved in the energy sector, such as those dealing with nuclear power, energy distribution, and related industries.

2. **Understand the TTPs**: 
   - **Supply Chain Attack**: This involves compromising a target by first infiltrating a supplier or vendor that has access to the target's systems. This is a known TTP used by sophisticated threat actors to gain access to high-security environments indirectly.
   - **Watering Hole Attack**: This involves compromising a website or network that is frequently visited by individuals from a specific industry or sector, with the aim of infecting their devices. This is a plausible step for targeting critical infrastructure personnel who might visit specific websites related to their work.
   - **Targeting Software Suppliers for PLC Components**: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are critical components in industrial control systems. Targeting suppliers of software for these components could allow an attacker to compromise the PLCs themselves, either by inserting malware into the software or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The sequence starts with targeting software suppliers for PLC components, which aligns with Energetic Bear's interest in industrial control systems.
   - Following this with a supply chain attack to compromise a Turkish energy company's website is plausible, as it leverages the initial compromise for further access into the target sector.
   - Conducting a watering hole attack from the compromised website to target Turkish critical infrastructure personnel is a logical next step, aiming to infect devices of individuals who might have access to sensitive systems.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given Energetic Bear's known interests and TTPs, the described sequence of actions is consistent with their modus operandi. They have been known to target the energy sector, use supply chain attacks, and aim to compromise industrial control systems. Therefore, it is plausible that they would engage in such a sequence of attacks to target Turkish critical infrastructure.
