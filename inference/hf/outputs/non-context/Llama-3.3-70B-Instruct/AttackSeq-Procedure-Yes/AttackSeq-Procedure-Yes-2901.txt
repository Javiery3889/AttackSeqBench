To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Credential Access**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials. Mimikatz is a tool known for extracting plaintext passwords, hash, PIN code, and kerberos tickets from memory. This aligns with the Credential Access tactic (TA0006) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "OS Credential Dumping" technique (T1003).

2. **Initial Access**: APT15 stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely. This action can be associated with the "Valid Accounts" technique (T1078) under the Initial Access tactic (TA0001), as it involves using legitimate credentials (in this case, a VPN certificate) to gain access to the network.

3. **Persistence and Execution**: The question then mentions the deployment of backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. Backdoors are associated with the "Remote Access Tools" technique (T1219) under the Persistence tactic (TA0003) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This would allow APT15 to maintain access to the network.

4. **Execution and Defense Evasion**: Leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution relates to the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique (T1059) under the Execution tactic (TA0002), and potentially "Application Access Token" (T1134) or "Impersonation" (T1133) under Defense Evasion (TA0005), depending on how the bypass is achieved.

Given this sequence of TTPs:
- **Obtaining credentials** and **gaining initial access** through legitimate means (Mimikatz and VPN certificate) sets the stage for further malicious activity.
- **Deploying backdoors** would be a logical next step for maintaining persistence and ensuring continued access to the compromised network.
- **Using tools like RoyalCLI** to bypass security controls (such as command prompt policy settings) would facilitate the execution of commands and potentially other malicious activities without detection.

Considering these points, the sequence of actions described forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after obtaining domain administrator credentials and accessing the network, APT15 would likely deploy backdoors and use tools to bypass security controls for execution.
