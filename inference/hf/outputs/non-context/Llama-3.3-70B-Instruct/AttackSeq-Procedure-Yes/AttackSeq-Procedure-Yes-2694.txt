To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like Elfin.

1. **Establishing Command and Control (C2):** The use of POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for establishing command and control is a common TTP among threat actors. POSHC2 is a C2 framework, and Quasar RAT is a remote access trojan, both of which can be used to control compromised systems remotely. This step is plausible as it aligns with the initial stages of an attack where attackers seek to establish a foothold within a network.

2. **Data Exfiltration:** After establishing C2, a common next step for attackers is to exfiltrate sensitive data. The use of custom tools for data exfiltration, such as a .NET FTP tool and FastUploader, indicates an attempt to efficiently transfer data out of the compromised network. FastUploader, being designed for faster data transfer, suggests the attackers are interested in quickly exfiltrating data, possibly to minimize detection.

3. **Evaluation of the Sequence:** The sequence described starts with establishing C2, which is a foundational step for further malicious activities, including data exfiltration. The use of specific tools like a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader for data exfiltration is consistent with the goal of efficiently transferring data out of a compromised network. This aligns with known TTPs where attackers often use customized or specialized tools to achieve their objectives, especially in the data exfiltration phase.

4. **Conclusion:** Given the context and the tools mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing command and control, Elfin would proceed with data exfiltration using efficient and possibly customized tools. This behavior is consistent with the objectives of many threat actors to steal sensitive information.
