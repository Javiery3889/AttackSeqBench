To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of using specific tools and techniques for lateral movement.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines an initial phase of network and Active Directory discovery using tools like ADFind and port scanning. This phase is crucial for gathering information about the network topology, identifying potential targets, and understanding the Active Directory structure.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence starts with discovery (using ADFind and port scanning), which is followed by the potential use of specific tools and techniques for lateral movement. The tools mentioned for lateral movement include direct shell commands and Cobalt Strike features like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery Phase**: The use of ADFind and port scanning for gathering information is a common practice in the initial stages of an attack. This phase helps attackers understand the network layout and identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Lateral Movement**: After the discovery phase, attackers often seek to move laterally within the network to achieve their objectives, which could include data exfiltration, establishing persistence, or escalating privileges. The tools and techniques mentioned (direct shell commands and Cobalt Strike features) are commonly used for lateral movement.
   - **Cobalt Strike Features**: Tools like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh are indeed used for lateral movement. They allow attackers to execute commands on remote systems, which can include deploying beacons (a type of malware used for maintaining access to compromised systems) to other systems within the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial discovery phase using ADFind and port scanning is aimed at gathering necessary information for planning the next steps.
   - The use of direct shell commands or Cobalt Strike features for lateral movement aligns with common attack patterns. These tools enable attackers to spread across the network, establishing access to additional systems.
   - The specific mention of propagating beacons to other systems indicates an intent to maintain access and potentially use these systems as pivots for further movement or as points for data exfiltration.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of the discovery phase and the tools mentioned for lateral movement, it is plausible that attackers would use direct shell commands or Cobalt Strike features like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh for propagating beacons to achieve lateral movement within the network.
