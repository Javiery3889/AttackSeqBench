To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the OceanLotus backdoor surveying the victim's computer before initiating command and control (C2) communication.

1. **Understanding the OceanLotus Backdoor**: The OceanLotus backdoor is a type of malware attributed to a group believed to be of Vietnamese origin. It is known for its sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to evade detection and to communicate with its command and control servers using custom protocols.

2. **Surveying the Victim's Computer**: The action of surveying or gathering information about the victim's computer, such as the victim's name and system information, aligns with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often associated with the initial stages of a cyber attack. This information can be crucial for the attackers to understand the environment they are operating in, to tailor their attack, and to decide on the next steps.

3. **Command and Control Communication**: The use of a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode for C2 communication indicates a level of sophistication and an intent to maintain stealth and security in the communication between the compromised host and the C2 server. This is consistent with the behavior of advanced threat actors who seek to maintain access to compromised systems without being detected.

4. **Likelihood of Surveying Before C2 Communication**: Given the nature of the OceanLotus backdoor and the general TTPs of sophisticated threat actors, it is plausible that the malware would gather information about the victim's system before establishing C2 communication. This information gathering can help in identifying potential targets for data exfiltration, lateral movement, or other malicious activities.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical behavior of sophisticated malware like the OceanLotus backdoor and the importance of reconnaissance in the attack lifecycle, it is reasonable to conclude that the backdoor would likely survey the victim's computer to gather relevant details before initiating encrypted C2 communication.
