To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the attackers' goals based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a scenario where attackers have already obtained domain administrative credentials during the credential access phase. They then use these credentials for discovery to compromise additional endpoints. The question asks if it's likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Credential Access**: Attackers obtained domain administrative credentials.
   - **Discovery**: Using the obtained credentials to compromise additional endpoints and possibly map the network.
   - **Lateral Movement**: The potential next step, implied by the question, involves using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The attackers have already demonstrated the ability to obtain domain administrative credentials, which is a high-privilege goal.
   - The use of these credentials for discovery suggests an attempt to understand the network layout and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - The question posits that before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account for lateral movement, the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials. Given that they already have domain administrative credentials, it seems redundant to "aim" for admin-level credentials unless the question implies seeking even higher privileges or more specific administrative accounts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Obtaining domain administrative credentials** is a significant achievement, providing substantial control over the network.
   - **Using these credentials for discovery** indicates an interest in the network's layout and security posture, likely to identify vulnerabilities or high-value targets.
   - The **goal of finding admin-level credentials** before using the Domain Administrator account for lateral movement might seem counterintuitive since they already possess high-level credentials. However, in the context of ensuring comprehensive access and minimizing detection, seeking additional admin credentials could be part of a strategy to maintain access and ensure that no potential avenue for lateral movement is overlooked.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context, it's plausible that the attackers would continue to seek additional admin-level credentials to ensure comprehensive control and access. This approach aligns with the principle of maximizing privileges and minimizing the risk of detection by diversifying access points.

**Final Answer: A**
