To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described communication with a Command and Control (C2) server.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Lampion trojan has already achieved persistence. This implies that the malware has successfully established a method to survive system restarts, in this case, by creating a .lnk file and a new VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) file. The creation of these files ensures the malware's execution at system startup, which is a technique often used by malware to maintain persistence (T1564.004 - Hide On Linux and T1547.001 - Create or Modify System Process: System File and Directory Permissions Modification for Windows, but more closely related to T1547.009 - Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service).

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - **Persistence**: Achieved through creating files that ensure the malware's execution at startup.
   - The question then inquires about the likelihood of **Command and Control (C2) communication** using an application layer protocol for sending collected data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Persistence** is a common precursor to **C2 communication** because for malware to be effective, especially in cases where data exfiltration or further malicious commands are required, it needs to communicate back to its operators.
   - The use of an **application layer protocol** for C2 purposes is common, as it allows the malware to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect. Protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and others are frequently used for this purpose.
   - Given that the malware has already established persistence, the next logical step in its operation would be to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has achieved persistence, indicating a successful initial infection phase.
   - For the malware to fulfill its purpose (whether it be data exfiltration, further system compromise, or other malicious activities), communication with a C2 server is typically necessary.
   - The use of an application layer protocol for this communication is plausible and common among malware operations.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the typical behavior of malware post-persistence, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would indeed communicate with a C2 server using an application layer protocol for command and control purposes.

Final Answer: A
