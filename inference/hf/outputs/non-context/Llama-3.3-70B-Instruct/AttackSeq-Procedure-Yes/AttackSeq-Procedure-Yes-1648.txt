To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Watering Hole Attack**: The initial access vector involves a watering hole attack targeting a popular software reseller, exploiting an Internet Explorer zero-day vulnerability. This is a sophisticated method, indicating the attackers are capable and willing to use high-impact, potentially expensive exploits for initial access.

2. **Adopting and Customizing Android Backdoors**: After gaining initial access, the scenario suggests the attackers would adopt and customize several Android backdoors. This action implies a shift in focus towards mobile devices, possibly to expand their reach within the compromised network or to target specific individuals who use Android devices. Customizing backdoors indicates an intent to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Utilizing Massive Infrastructure for Command and Control (C2)**: The use of a massive infrastructure for C2 suggests the attackers have significant resources at their disposal. This is consistent with advanced threat actors who often have the capability to set up and manage extensive C2 infrastructures to handle multiple compromised hosts and to distribute commands.

4. **Deploying Second-Stage Backdoors with Hardcoded Proxy Addresses and Credentials**: Deploying second-stage backdoors, especially with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials, is a technique used to establish a more persistent presence within the compromised network. It allows the attackers to maintain access even if the initial entry point is discovered and closed.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after gaining initial access through sophisticated means, it is likely the attack group would engage in further sophisticated activities such as customizing backdoors, utilizing significant C2 infrastructure, and deploying second-stage backdoors. This sequence aligns with the behavior of advanced threat actors who typically have the resources and expertise to perform such actions.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the described sequence of actions is unlikely. However, given the initial sophisticated attack vector, it would be unexpected for the attackers to suddenly limit their actions to less sophisticated methods or to not attempt to establish a strong, persistent presence within the compromised network.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access method suggests a sophisticated attack group.
2. The actions following initial access (customizing Android backdoors, using extensive C2 infrastructure, and deploying second-stage backdoors) are consistent with the tactics of advanced threat actors aiming to establish a strong, persistent presence.
3. The resources and expertise required for these actions align with the capabilities demonstrated by the initial watering hole attack and zero-day exploit.

**Final Answer: A**
