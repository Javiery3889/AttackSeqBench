To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) as described:

1. **Initial Execution**: The question starts with the execution of a macro (FlowCloud) that renames files and executes 'gup.exe' using a version of certutil.exe (referred to as Temptcm.tmp). This indicates an initial execution phase where the malware is setting up its environment.

2. **Execution Tactic**: The use of certutil.exe, a legitimate Windows utility, to execute 'gup.exe' suggests a tactic to blend in with normal system activity, making it harder to detect. This is a common technique used by attackers to execute malicious files under the guise of legitimate system processes.

3. **Potential Next Steps**: After the initial execution and setup, the next logical steps for malware would typically involve establishing persistence, escalating privileges, and possibly moving laterally within the network or extracting and installing additional payload components.

4. **Analysis of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after the initial execution, 'gup.exe' is executed, which then leads to the execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' for extracting and installing payload components. This sequence aligns with typical malware behavior post-initial execution, where the focus shifts to persistence and further compromise.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that the sequence described is unlikely, which would mean the malware's behavior deviates significantly from common patterns observed in similar attacks.

5. **Evaluation**: Given the context, the most plausible next steps after the initial execution involve actions aimed at persistence and further compromise. The execution of 'gup.exe' followed by 'EhStorAuthn.exe' for payload extraction and installation fits within the expected behavior of malware post-execution.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical behavior of malware and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described, the sequence where 'gup.exe' executes 'EhStorAuthn.exe' for extracting and installing payload components for persistence is a logical and common next step.

Final Answer: A
