To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and analyze how T1107 (File Deletion) fits into this sequence as a defense evasion technique.

1. **Exploiting CVE-2017-11882**: This is an initial access technique where an attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain silent code execution without user interaction. This step allows the attacker to establish a foothold in the system.

2. **Stealing stored passwords and access tokens**: After gaining access, the attacker's next steps involve techniques like Credential Dumping and accessing Credentials in Registry. These actions are aimed at escalating privileges and gaining further access to sensitive information.

3. **Employing T1107 (File Deletion) for defense evasion**: T1107 involves deleting files to evade detection. This could include deleting logs, malware files, or other indicators of compromise to make it harder for defenders to detect the intrusion.

Given the sequence of actions:
- The attacker first gains access through exploitation.
- Then, the attacker aims to gather more credentials for further access and potentially lateral movement.
- Before or after stealing credentials, the attacker might want to cover their tracks to avoid detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains access through a vulnerability.
2. **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**: The attacker seeks to gather more credentials.
3. **Defense Evasion**: To avoid detection during or after these activities, deleting files (T1107) could be a plausible step. This would help in removing evidence of the exploit, malware, or any other files that could indicate an intrusion, thus making it harder for security tools and personnel to detect the attack.

Considering the logical flow of an attack where an attacker seeks to remain undetected, employing T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion after gaining access and before or after stealing credentials makes sense. It aligns with common tactics used by attackers to cover their tracks and avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A**
