To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and relate them to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with threat actors like BRONZE PRESIDENT, using the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a reference.

1. **Initial Access (TA0001)**: The question mentions using phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files for initial access. This is a common technique used by various threat actors to gain initial access to a network. Phishing (T1566) is a social engineering attack where attackers send emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, tricking victims into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions that aid the attack.

2. **Resource Development (TA0024)**: This tactic involves the development or acquisition of resources that can be used to support operations. This could include developing custom malware or tools, such as remote access tools (RATs), which are used for persistence and lateral movement within a compromised network. Custom remote access tools can be particularly useful for maintaining access, exfiltrating data, and conducting further malicious activities without being easily detected by security software.

Given the context of BRONZE PRESIDENT's operations and the mention of using phishing lures related to national security and law enforcement to gather information, it suggests a level of sophistication and intent to infiltrate specific targets. The development of custom remote access tools as part of their resource development aligns with the goal of maintaining access and conducting espionage or other malicious activities within the compromised networks.

Therefore, considering the steps and the tactics involved:
- **Phishing for initial access** is a common entry point.
- **Developing custom tools** for persistence and further exploitation is a logical step for a sophisticated threat actor aiming for long-term access and data exfiltration.

Given these considerations, it is plausible that BRONZE PRESIDENT would develop custom remote access tools as part of their resource development before or after using phishing emails for initial access, as these tools would facilitate deeper infiltration and persistence within the target networks.
