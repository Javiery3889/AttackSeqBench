To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of events and technologies mentioned:

1. **Initial Access via Spear Phishing**: The question starts with APT35 gaining access to a corporate device through a spear phishing email. This is a common initial access tactic (TTP - Technique, Tactics, and Procedures) used by threat actors to infiltrate a network. Spear phishing involves sending targeted, deceptive emails that appear to come from a trusted source, aiming to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link that installs malware.

2. **Infection and Command and Control (C2) Detection**: After the initial access, the malware would likely establish a communication channel with its command and control server. This phase is critical for the attackers to issue commands, exfiltrate data, or install additional malware. The detection of this C2 communication is a key indicator of compromise (IoC).

3. **Automated Investigation by Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst**: Darktrace is an Enterprise Immune System that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect and respond to cyber threats in real time. Its Cyber AI Analyst is designed to automate the investigation process, reducing the time it takes to understand and respond to security incidents.

Given this context, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: It is plausible that after detecting the command and control communication (indicative of a potential breach), an automated system like Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst would be triggered to investigate the incident further. This system can analyze network traffic, system calls, and other data to understand the scope of the breach, identify affected systems, and potentially recommend or automate responses to contain the threat.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the automated investigation process would not be initiated following the detection of command and control activity. However, given the capabilities of modern cybersecurity tools like Darktrace, it is less likely that such a significant event would not trigger an automated response or investigation.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. APT35 uses spear phishing for initial access, which is a known TTP.
2. The establishment of command and control is a logical next step after initial access.
3. Detection of C2 activity is a critical indicator of compromise that would likely trigger an automated response.
4. Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is designed for automated investigation and response, making it a suitable tool for analyzing the infected device post-detection.

**Final Answer: A**
