To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the Sayad malware based on the information provided and general knowledge of malware tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sayad malware:
   - **Discovery**: The malware collects system and application details from the compromised host. This aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gathering information about the system, network, or application.
   - **Data Collection**: After discovery, the malware is considered to capture screenshots as part of its data collection efforts. This action falls under the "Collection" tactic, where an adversary gathers data of interest to their goal.
   - **Exfiltration**: Finally, the collected and encrypted data are exfiltrated to a malicious web server. This corresponds to the "Exfiltration" tactic, where data is transferred from the compromised system to an adversary-controlled system.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests that after performing discovery, the malware proceeds with capturing screenshots (data collection) before exfiltrating the data. This sequence is plausible because it follows a logical progression of an attack: gather information about the system (discovery), collect specific data of interest (collection), and then transfer that data out of the network (exfiltration).
   - **Option B (No)**: This option implies that the malware does not capture screenshots as part of its data collection efforts before exfiltrating the data. While possible, this option does not provide an alternative sequence of actions that would logically precede exfiltration in the context given.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The discovery phase is typically followed by actions that utilize the gathered information to further the adversary's goals, such as collecting specific data.
   - Capturing screenshots can provide valuable information to the adversary, such as sensitive data displayed on the screen, which aligns with the goals of the "Collection" tactic.
   - Exfiltrating collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server is a common method used by malware to transfer stolen data out of a compromised network.

**Final Answer: A**
