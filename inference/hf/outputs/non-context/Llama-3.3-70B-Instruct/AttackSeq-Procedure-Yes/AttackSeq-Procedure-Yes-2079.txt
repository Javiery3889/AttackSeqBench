To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the exploit server's actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, particularly in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an exploit kit (RIG EK) uses proxy servers to obscure its infections, making them harder to detect. This action aligns with the technique of "Proxy" (T1090.001) under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is used for command and control (C2) communications to hide the true source of the traffic.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described involves:
   - **Initial Infection**: The use of an exploit kit (RIG EK) to infect a system.
   - **Evasion**: Utilizing proxy servers within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The potential return of encrypted exploit code for establishing an encrypted channel.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The use of proxy servers for evasion is a common technique to avoid detection.
   - The return of encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted C2 channel is consistent with techniques used by threat actors to maintain stealthy communications. This aligns with the "Encrypted Channel" (T1573) technique under the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where adversaries might use custom or non-standard encryption protocols to hide their communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial use of an exploit kit and proxy servers indicates a sophisticated approach to evade detection.
   - **Step 2**: The use of encryption (in this case, a custom version of the RC4 algorithm) for C2 communications is a logical next step to maintain the stealthiness of the operation and protect the integrity of the command and control channel.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of using proxy servers for evasion, it is reasonable to assume that the exploit server would employ additional measures to secure its communications, such as encryption.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the sequence of TTPs described and the common practices of threat actors to maintain stealthy operations, it is likely that RIG EK's exploit server would return encrypted exploit code using a custom encryption method for establishing an encrypted channel in its C2 operations.
