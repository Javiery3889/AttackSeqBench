To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a specific attack sequence attributed to Hidden Cobra, a known threat actor group. The sequence starts with spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878, a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player, to gain initial access to Turkish financial organizations. The question then asks if it's likely that Hidden Cobra would develop Bankshot implants with specific capabilities under the tactic of Resource Development.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Initial Access**: Gained through spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878.
   - **Developing Capabilities**: Developing Bankshot implants for full control over victim systems and file wiping capabilities.
   - **Tactic**: Resource Development, which involves establishing and maintaining infrastructure and capabilities to support other tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Hidden Cobra's Known Activities**: Hidden Cobra is known for sophisticated cyber attacks, including the use of malware like Bankshot. The development of implants with capabilities for full system control and data destruction aligns with the goals of maintaining access and causing disruption, which are common objectives in cyber espionage and sabotage.
   - **Resource Development Tactic**: This tactic involves creating, buying, or stealing resources (including malware and implants) that can be used to support other tactics. Developing or acquiring implants like Bankshot fits within this tactic as it enhances the attacker's capabilities for future operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Hidden Cobra uses spear phishing with exploit CVE-2018-4878 for initial access, which is a known TTP for gaining entry into targeted systems.
   - **Step 2**: The development of Bankshot implants with specific capabilities (full system control and file wiping) supports the notion of resource development, as these capabilities can be used to maintain access, gather intelligence, or disrupt operations.
   - **Step 3**: Given Hidden Cobra's history of sophisticated attacks and the alignment of Bankshot's capabilities with the goals of resource development, it is plausible that they would develop such implants as part of their tactics.

**Final Answer: A**
