To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) typically observed in cyber attacks, keeping in mind the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Discovery**: The command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' is used to gather system information. This action aligns with the "Discovery" tactic (TA0007) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary gathers information about the system and its environment.

2. **Command and Control (C2)**: The system information is sent to '45.124.132.127', which suggests that this IP address is acting as a Command and Control (C2) server. Establishing C2 is a critical step for attackers to issue commands to compromised systems. The use of a specific IP address for C2 communication is a common technique (T1043: Commonly Used Port) but can vary based on the attacker's infrastructure and evasion techniques.

3. **HTTPS for C2 Communication**: Using HTTPS for C2 communication (T1071: Application Layer Protocol) is a common practice among attackers because it allows them to blend in with normal HTTPS traffic, making detection more difficult. Given that the malware has already established communication with a C2 server, it's plausible that it would use a secure protocol like HTTPS for further communication to avoid detection.

4. **Contacting 'marina-info.net'**: The question mentions contacting the domain 'marina-info.net' for further operations. This could be part of the attacker's strategy to use multiple C2 servers or domains for resilience and redundancy, or it could be related to specific tasks such as downloading additional malware or exfiltrating data.

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs described suggests a sophisticated attack where the malware:

- Gathers system information.
- Establishes communication with a C2 server.
- Potentially uses secure communication protocols (like HTTPS) for C2 to evade detection.
- May use additional domains or servers for various operations.

Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would establish an HTTPS communication with the C2 server before or while contacting 'marina-info.net' for further operations, as this aligns with common tactics used by attackers to maintain stealthy and resilient C2 communications.
