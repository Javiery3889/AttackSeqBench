To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of RIG Exploit Kit (EK) delivering exploits as described:

1. **Initial Infection Vector**: The question starts with the exploitation of known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines. This is a common initial infection vector for many types of malware and exploit kits, including RIG EK. Exploit kits like RIG EK are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in software, especially in browsers and their plugins, to gain initial access to a victim's system.

2. **Obtaining Capabilities**: After the initial exploitation, the malware or exploit kit obtains capabilities on the victim machine. This could mean establishing a foothold, escalating privileges, or downloading additional malware components.

3. **Delivery Mechanism**: The question then asks about the likelihood of RIG EK delivering exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting them to its landing page. Malvertising is a technique used by attackers to distribute malware through online advertisements. When a user visits a compromised website or clicks on a malicious ad, they can be redirected to an exploit kit's landing page, which then attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the user's browser or plugins.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after initial exploitation and obtaining capabilities, RIG EK is likely to use malvertising as a method to redirect users to its landing page. This is plausible because exploit kits often use various vectors to infect machines, and malvertising can be an effective way to reach a large number of potential victims. RIG EK, being a well-known exploit kit, has been observed using various tactics to infect systems, including drive-by downloads from compromised websites and malvertising.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that RIG EK would not use malvertising as a method to deliver exploits after the initial infection. While it's possible that not all campaigns involving RIG EK use malvertising, it's less likely that this vector would be entirely avoided given its effectiveness in distributing malware.

Considering the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with exploit kits like RIG EK, and the specifics of the question, the most plausible sequence involves the use of malvertising as a delivery mechanism. This aligns with known behaviors of exploit kits aiming to maximize their reach and infection rates.

Final Answer: A
