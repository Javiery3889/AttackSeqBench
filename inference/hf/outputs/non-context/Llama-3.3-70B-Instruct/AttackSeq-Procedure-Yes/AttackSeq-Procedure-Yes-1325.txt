To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the CosmicDuke malware based on known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) associated with it.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions that include searching removable drives for files (while skipping certain file types) during the discovery phase. This action is followed by the potential use of a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard and then exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Discovery**: Searching removable drives for files, skipping certain file types. This can be associated with the "File and Directory Discovery" technique (T1207) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary searches for files and directories of interest.
   - **Collection**: Using a clipboard stealer to collect data. This aligns with the "Clipboard Data" technique (T1115), where an adversary steals data from the clipboard.
   - **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP. This matches the "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" technique (T1048), specifically using FTP as an alternative protocol for data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - CosmicDuke is known for its capabilities in collecting sensitive information from compromised systems. Its TTPs include various methods for data collection and exfiltration.
   - The described sequence involves specific actions (discovery, collection using a clipboard stealer, and exfiltration via FTP) that are plausible for a sophisticated malware like CosmicDuke, which is designed to gather and transmit sensitive data back to its command and control servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: CosmicDuke's primary goal is to collect sensitive information, which aligns with the initial action of searching for files on removable drives.
   - **Step 2**: The use of a clipboard stealer is a known method for collecting data, especially sensitive information like passwords or encryption keys that might be copied to the clipboard.
   - **Step 3**: Exfiltrating data via FTP is a common method used by various malware types to transfer stolen data to remote servers, given FTP's widespread use and the relative ease of setting up FTP servers for command and control purposes.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the TTPs associated with CosmicDuke and the described sequence of actions, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use a clipboard stealer to collect data before exfiltrating it via FTP as part of its operation to gather and transmit sensitive information.
