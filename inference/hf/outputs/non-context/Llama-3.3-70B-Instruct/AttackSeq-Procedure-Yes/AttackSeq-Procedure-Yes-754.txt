To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events described and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework for context.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a malicious XLS (Excel) attachment that uses a VB (Visual Basic) macro. This is a common technique for gaining initial access to a system, as macros can execute arbitrary code. According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this aligns with "T1193: Spearphishing Attachment" under the Initial Access tactic.

2. **Execution**: The VB macro silently downloads a malicious MSI (Microsoft Installer) package for execution. MSI files are used for installing software, and in this context, it's being used to execute malicious code. This aligns with "T1204: User Execution" and potentially "T1218: Signed Binary Proxy Execution" if the MSI is signed, under the Execution tactic.

3. **Persistence**: The question asks if it's likely that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK (shortcut) file for autorun at Windows Startup. Achieving persistence means the malware ensures it can continue to run on the system even after a restart. Installing an LNK file to autorun at startup is a method of persistence, aligning with "T1547: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution" under the Persistence tactic.

Given this sequence:
- The initial vector (malicious XLS with VB macro) is plausible for gaining initial access.
- The use of an MSI package for execution is a viable method for executing malicious code.
- Installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup is a known technique for achieving persistence.

Therefore, considering the logical flow of the attack sequence and the TTPs involved, it is indeed plausible that the MSI package would attempt to achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
