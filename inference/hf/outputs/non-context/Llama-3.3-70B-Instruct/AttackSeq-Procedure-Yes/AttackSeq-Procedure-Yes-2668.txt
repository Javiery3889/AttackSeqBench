To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the OceanLotus backdoor based on the information provided:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The OceanLotus backdoor, also known as APT32 or APT-C-00, is a sophisticated piece of malware attributed to Vietnamese threat actors. It is known for its ability to evade detection and its complex capabilities, including espionage and data theft.

2. **Analyzing the Behavior**: The question mentions that after achieving persistence, the malware copies itself to specific locations. Achieving persistence is a critical step in the attack lifecycle, as it allows the malware to survive system reboots and maintain access to the compromised system. The locations mentioned (`~/Library/OpenSSL/` or `/Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs`) suggest an attempt to blend in with legitimate system files or applications, further indicating an intent to remain undetected.

3. **Surveying the Victim's Computer**: After establishing a foothold, it is common for advanced threats like the OceanLotus backdoor to gather information about the system. This can include details such as the operating system version, installed software, network configuration, and user permissions. This information is valuable for planning subsequent stages of the attack, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

4. **Sending Encrypted Details to Command and Control (C2) Server**: The act of sending system information back to a C2 server is a typical behavior for backdoors. This communication allows the attackers to assess the value of the compromised system, plan further exploitation, and potentially use the system as a pivot point for attacking other networks or systems.

Given these considerations, the behavior described in the question aligns with the typical actions of an advanced threat actor seeking to exploit a compromised system for espionage or other malicious purposes. The OceanLotus backdoor, being a sophisticated tool, would likely engage in such activities to maximize the value of the compromise.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The malware achieves persistence, indicating a desire to maintain access.
- It copies itself to locations that could help it avoid detection, suggesting a long-term exploitation strategy.
- Gathering system information is a logical next step for planning further exploitation.
- Sending this information to a C2 server encrypted would be a secure way to communicate with the attackers without arousing suspicion.

**Final Answer: A**
