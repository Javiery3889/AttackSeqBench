To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Collecting browser credentials using the blacksoulLib DLL**: This indicates the use of a specific malware or tool (blacksoulLib DLL) to steal browser credentials from a victim's system. This action aligns with the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Credentials from Password Stores" technique.

2. **Returning data to BlackSoul in JSON format**: This step involves the exfiltration of the collected credentials back to the command and control (C2) server, which is controlled by the adversary (in this case, BlackSoul). The use of JSON format for data transfer suggests a structured method of communicating stolen data, which is common in many malware and cyber attack scenarios. This action can be associated with the "Exfiltration" tactic and the "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" technique.

3. **Capability to run arbitrary commands and perform file transfers**: This indicates that the malware or the tool used by BlackSoul has the capability to execute commands on the compromised system and transfer files, which aligns with the "Execution" and "Collection" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Specifically, the ability to run arbitrary commands can be linked to techniques like "Command and Scripting Interpreter," and file transfer capabilities can be related to "Data Staging" and "Exfiltration" techniques.

Given these capabilities and the context provided, the question asks whether it is likely that BlackSoul will exfiltrate collected files to the C2 server over its communication channel.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

- **Step 1**: BlackSoul has already demonstrated the capability to collect sensitive data (browser credentials) and return it to their C2 server, indicating an established communication channel.
- **Step 2**: The use of a specific library (blacksoulLib DLL) for credential collection and the structured data return (in JSON format) suggest a sophisticated and organized approach to data exfiltration.
- **Step 3**: The capability to run arbitrary commands and perform file transfers further supports the likelihood of exfiltrating collected files, as these are common TTPs used in data exfiltration scenarios.

**Conclusion**: Given the established communication channel, the demonstrated capability for data exfiltration, and the ability to run arbitrary commands and transfer files, it is highly plausible that BlackSoul would use these capabilities to exfiltrate collected files to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A**
