To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a specific behavior of the WinDealer malware, focusing on its exfiltration phase where it processes and encrypts stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory. It then inquires about the likelihood of WinDealer communicating with Command and Control (C2) servers using an AES key encrypted with RSA as part of its command and control activities.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve:
   - Data Exfiltration: Encrypting stolen data.
   - Command and Control: Communicating with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Data Exfiltration (T1041)**: This involves the transfer of sensitive data from a system to an external destination. Encrypting data before exfiltration is a common technique to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control (T1043)**: This involves establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker's C2 server. Using encryption, such as AES with an RSA-encrypted key, for C2 communications is a sophisticated method to protect the communication channel from interception and eavesdropping.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Encryption of Stolen Data**: The use of encryption for stolen data indicates a level of sophistication and concern for avoiding detection.
   - **Secure C2 Communication**: Using an AES key encrypted with RSA for C2 communication is a secure method that aligns with the sophistication level indicated by the encryption of stolen data. This method protects the C2 channel, ensuring that commands and potentially exfiltrated data remain confidential and integrity is maintained.
   - **Likelihood**: Given the context of encrypting stolen data, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would also employ secure communication methods for C2 activities to maintain operational security.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Considering the sophistication of encrypting stolen data and the importance of secure communication for C2 activities, it is plausible that WinDealer would use an AES key encrypted with RSA for communicating with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A**
