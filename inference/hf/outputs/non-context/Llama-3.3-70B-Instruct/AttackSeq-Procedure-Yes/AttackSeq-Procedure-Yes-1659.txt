To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the malware gathering system information before attempting encrypted HTTPS communication with its Command and Control (C2) server.

1. **Defense Evasion Techniques**: The use of techniques like DLL side-loading and HTML smuggling indicates that the attackers are attempting to evade detection by traditional security measures. DLL side-loading involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, while HTML smuggling is a technique used to bypass content filters and deliver malware. These techniques suggest a sophisticated attack aimed at avoiding detection.

2. **Gathering System Information**: After successfully evading defenses, the next logical step for an attacker would be to gather information about the compromised system. This includes details such as usernames, computer names, network configurations, and other system specifics. This information is crucial for the attackers to understand the environment they are operating in, identify potential targets or valuable data, and plan their next moves.

3. **Establishing C2 Communication**: Once the attackers have gathered sufficient information about the system, they would likely attempt to establish a communication channel with their C2 server. This communication is often encrypted, such as using HTTPS, to avoid detection by network monitoring tools. The C2 server acts as a command center from which the attackers can issue commands, receive stolen data, and upload additional malware.

Given these steps, it is logical that after employing defense evasion techniques, the malware would gather system information to better understand its environment and identify potential targets or valuable data. This information gathering would likely occur before or concurrently with establishing encrypted communication with the C2 server, as knowing the system details would help in deciding what commands to send or what data to exfiltrate.

Therefore, considering the sequence of actions typically involved in a cyber attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would indeed gather system information like usernames and computer names before attempting encrypted HTTPS communication with its C2 server.
