To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Credential Dumping**: The use of Mimikatz to dump credentials from memory is a technique (T1003) used by attackers to obtain account credentials. This is often a precursor to lateral movement, as it provides the attackers with the necessary credentials to access other systems.

2. **Pass-the-Hash**: Employing Impacket tools for pass-the-hash (T1550) allows attackers to use the hashed credentials obtained from the previous step to authenticate to other systems without needing the plaintext password. This technique is commonly used for lateral movement.

3. **Discovery of Remote Systems**: Before moving laterally, attackers typically need to identify potential targets within the network. This involves network discovery techniques (such as T1018 - Remote System Discovery) to find remote systems that can be accessed using the obtained credentials.

4. **Lateral Movement**: Using credentials with Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement (T1021) is a method to execute commands on remote systems. This step follows naturally after discovering potential targets and having the necessary credentials.

Given this sequence:
- The attackers start by obtaining credentials (Mimikatz).
- They then use these credentials for pass-the-hash attacks (Impacket tools).
- To effectively use these credentials for lateral movement, they would need to identify remote systems they can access.
- Finally, they use the discovered systems and obtained credentials to move laterally (Impacket's atexec tool).

Therefore, it is logical and consistent with known attack patterns that after obtaining and utilizing credentials for pass-the-hash, threat actors would engage in discovering remote systems before moving laterally using those credentials.
