To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the TDrop2 malware communicating with Command and Control (C2) servers using an encrypted channel after performing discovery activities.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions that after performing discovery activities (such as collecting system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths), we are to determine if it's likely that the TDrop2 malware will communicate with C2 servers using an encrypted channel. The discovery activities align with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gathering information about the target system or network.

2. **Identifying TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned involve collecting system and network information, which is a common initial step in an attack sequence. This is typically followed by establishing a means of communication with C2 servers to exfiltrate data, receive further instructions, or upload additional malware.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: It is common for malware, after establishing a foothold and gathering necessary information, to communicate with C2 servers. Using an encrypted channel for this communication is a typical tactic to evade detection by network security monitoring tools. Encrypted communication (often using HTTPS, SSL/TLS, or custom encryption protocols) helps in hiding the content of the communication, making it harder for defenders to detect and analyze the malware's activities.
   - **B: No**: While some malware might communicate in plain text, especially in cases where evasion is not a priority or the communication is designed to blend in with normal traffic, it is less common for sophisticated malware like TDrop2 to do so, especially after performing discovery activities that suggest an intent to maintain access and possibly exfiltrate sensitive information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware has already performed discovery activities, indicating an interest in the system or network beyond initial compromise.
   - **Step 2**: For the malware to effectively utilize the gathered information or to receive further instructions without being detected, secure communication with C2 servers is beneficial.
   - **Step 3**: Given the context of discovery activities followed by the need for potentially sensitive communication, using an encrypted channel is a logical step for evading detection and maintaining the integrity of the communication.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Considering the typical behavior of malware post-discovery and the importance of evasion techniques, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the malware communicating with C2 servers using an encrypted channel.

Final Answer: A
