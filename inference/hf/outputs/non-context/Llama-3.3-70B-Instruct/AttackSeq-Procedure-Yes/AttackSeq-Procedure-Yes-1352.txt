To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks, particularly those related to the exploitation of vulnerabilities and evasion techniques.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing and Exploitation of Adobe Flash Vulnerability**: The attack begins with a spear-phishing campaign that exploits an Adobe Flash vulnerability. This is a common initial access vector, as spear-phishing attacks are highly targeted and can be very effective, while Adobe Flash vulnerabilities have historically been a popular target for attackers due to their prevalence and the potential for exploitation.

2. **Execution of Shellcode using Embedded ActionScript Classes**: After the initial exploitation, the question mentions the execution of shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes within the 'show.swf' file. This is a plausible next step, as ActionScript can be used to execute malicious code, including shellcode, on a victim's system. Exploits for Adobe Flash often use ActionScript to achieve their goals, including downloading and executing additional payloads.

3. **Evasion with a Payload Embedded in an Animated GIF Image 'b.gif'**: The final step mentioned involves evading defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image, 'b.gif'. This could be a method to hide the malicious payload in a seemingly innocuous file type, attempting to evade detection by security software that might not thoroughly inspect image files for malicious code.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- **Exploitation of a vulnerability** to gain initial access is a common first step in many attacks.
- **Using embedded ActionScript** to execute shellcode is a known technique for exploiting Flash vulnerabilities.
- **Hiding payloads in innocuous-looking files**, such as images, is a tactic used to evade security controls.

Considering these points, the sequence described aligns with known TTPs used by attackers. Therefore, it is plausible that after exploiting the Adobe Flash vulnerability, the 'show.swf' file would execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes and then attempt to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'.
