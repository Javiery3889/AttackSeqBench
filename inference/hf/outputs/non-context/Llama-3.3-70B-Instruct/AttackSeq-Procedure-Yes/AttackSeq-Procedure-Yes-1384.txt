To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and analyze the likelihood of the outcome based on the given information.

1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The initial step involves using tools like masscan (for network scanning) and search engines such as Shodan and Censys. These tools are specifically designed to scan the internet for open ports and services, identifying potential vulnerabilities and entry points into networks. Shodan and Censys are particularly known for their ability to discover internet-connected devices, including those that might not be intended for public access.

2. **Identification of Potential Targets**: The use of these tools during the reconnaissance phase is aimed at identifying potential entry points into medical networks. Given the nature of these tools, it's plausible that they could uncover a wide range of connected devices, including those that are not typically considered part of the standard IT infrastructure, such as Building Management Systems (BMS) and medical devices.

3. **Discovery of Outdated Systems and MQTT Protocol**: Many Building Management Systems and some medical devices might use the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for communication. MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol that is often used in IoT (Internet of Things) devices due to its low bandwidth requirements and ease of implementation. If these systems are outdated, they might not have the latest security patches, making them vulnerable to exploitation.

4. **Likelihood of Discovery**: Given the capabilities of the tools mentioned (masscan, Shodan, Censys) and the common use of MQTT in IoT devices, it is indeed likely that cybercriminals could discover outdated Building Management Systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the medical network perimeter during their reconnaissance efforts.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible outcome is that the cybercriminals could indeed discover such vulnerable systems, given the right tools and the known vulnerabilities in outdated systems and devices using the MQTT protocol.
