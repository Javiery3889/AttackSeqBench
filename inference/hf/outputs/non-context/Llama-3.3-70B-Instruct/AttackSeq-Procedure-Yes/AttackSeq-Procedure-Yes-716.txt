To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described behavior based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware and implants.

1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The implant starts by gathering information such as network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address, and OS product name from the registry. This step is typical for many types of malware and implants as it helps the attackers understand the environment they are operating in, identify potential targets or vulnerabilities, and customize their attack strategy.

2. **Communication with Control Servers**: After gathering initial information, the next logical step for an implant, especially one designed for espionage or remote access like the Rising Sun implant, would be to establish communication with its command and control (C2) servers. This communication is crucial for receiving further instructions, uploading stolen data, and potentially downloading additional malware.

3. **Use of HTTP POST Requests**: Using HTTP POST requests for C2 communication is a common tactic. HTTP POST allows the implant to send data to the server, which can include the information gathered during reconnaissance, and receive commands or additional payloads in return. This method blends in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.

4. **Specific URLs (e.g., 34.214.99.20/view_style.php and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php)**: The use of specific, potentially compromised or malicious URLs for C2 communication is also a known tactic. These URLs might be part of a larger C2 infrastructure designed to manage multiple implants or to distribute commands and updates.

Given these considerations:

- The initial reconnaissance step aligns with typical malware behavior aimed at understanding the target environment.
- The need for C2 communication is consistent with the goals of an implant like Rising Sun, which would require external direction to fulfill its purpose.
- The method of using HTTP POST requests for this communication is plausible and common.
- The specific URLs mentioned could plausibly serve as C2 servers, given the context.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The implant's initial actions are consistent with setting up for further malicious activity.
2. The implant needs a way to communicate with its operators, which is typically done through C2 servers.
3. The method of communication (HTTP POST requests) and the use of specific URLs are consistent with known TTPs used by similar malware.

**Final Answer: A**
