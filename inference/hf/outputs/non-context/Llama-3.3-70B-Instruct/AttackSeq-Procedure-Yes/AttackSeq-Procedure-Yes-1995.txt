To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Discovery Activities**: The initial step involves SkinnyBoy conducting discovery activities. This includes extracting the volume serial number and enumerating user-specific directories and AppData folders. This phase is about gathering information about the target system, which aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Techniques under this tactic include System Information Discovery (T1082) and System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016), among others.

2. **Automating Collection**: After discovering the necessary information, the next step mentioned is automating the collection of data. This implies using some form of automation or tooling to gather more specific data of interest, which could include files, credentials, or other sensitive information. This aligns with the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where techniques like Data from Local System (T1005) might be used.

3. **Encoding Data**: The use of the CryptBinaryToStringA API for encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate or encrypt the collected data. This is a common technique used by adversaries to avoid detection, making it harder for security tools to inspect the content of the data being exfiltrated. This action can be related to the "Exfiltration" tactic and specifically to the Data Encrypted (T1022) technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Sending Data to C2 Server**: Finally, sending the collected and encoded information to a Command and Control (C2) server via an HTTP POST request is a method of exfiltrating the data from the compromised system. This directly aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic, specifically the Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) technique, and the use of Application Layer Protocol (T1071) for the actual data transfer.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence:
- **Discovery** to gather initial information about the system.
- **Collection** of specific data of interest.
- **Encoding** the data to avoid detection.
- **Exfiltration** of the encoded data to a C2 server.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of these TTPs and their alignment with known adversary behaviors as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is indeed likely that after conducting discovery activities, SkinnyBoy would automate the collection of data, encode it, and then send it to a C2 server via an HTTP POST request.
