To answer this question, let's break it down step by step, analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and comparing them with the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question mentions the use of Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz for credential dumping during the discovery phase. This indicates the adversary is in the **Credential Access** (TA0006) tactic phase, using **OS Credential Dumping** (T1003) as a technique.
   - The question then mentions copying results of the discovery phase, such as local file- and directory lists. This action aligns with the **Discovery** (TA0007) tactic, specifically techniques like **File and Directory Discovery** (T1083).
   - The preparation for exfiltration after achieving collection by gathering data from local systems points towards the **Collection** (TA0009) and **Exfiltration** (TA0010) tactics. The collection could involve techniques like **Data from Local System** (T1005), and exfiltration could involve various techniques depending on the method used (e.g., **Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol** (T1048)).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - Given the sequence of actions (credential dumping, discovery, and preparation for exfiltration), we're looking at a logical progression of an attack where an adversary gathers information, uses that information to access more data, and then prepares to exfiltrate that data.
   - Answer choice A (Yes) suggests that after discovering and collecting data (including credentials and local system information), it is likely the adversary would copy the results in preparation for exfiltration. This aligns with the typical goals of an adversary post-compromise, which include gathering valuable data and exfiltrating it for further use or sale.
   - Answer choice B (No) implies that copying the results of the discovery phase for exfiltration is unlikely, which contradicts common adversary behaviors observed in cyber attacks where data collection and exfiltration are primary objectives.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** The adversary uses Mimikatz for credential dumping, indicating an interest in accessing sensitive information.
   - **Step 2:** The discovery phase involves gathering more information about the local system, which is a common step after initial compromise to understand the environment and identify valuable data.
   - **Step 3:** Preparing the collected data for exfiltration is a logical next step for an adversary looking to exploit the accessed information for financial gain, espionage, or other malicious purposes.
   - **Conclusion:** Given the logical progression of an attack and the typical goals of an adversary, it is reasonable to conclude that copying the results of the discovery phase in preparation for exfiltration is a likely action.

Final Answer: A
