To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of CosmicDuke, a known malware, in relation to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes searching removable drives, skipping certain file types during collection, and then using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information. Finally, it mentions exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Understanding CosmicDuke**: CosmicDuke is a type of malware that has been associated with various cyber espionage campaigns. It is known for its ability to steal sensitive information from compromised systems.

3. **Evaluating TTPs**:
   - **Searching Removable Drives and Skipping Certain File Types**: This action suggests the malware is looking for specific types of data, possibly avoiding system files or files that are less likely to contain valuable information.
   - **Using a Keylogger, Screenshotter, and Clipboard Stealer**: These tools are typically used to gather more dynamic information about the user's activities, such as passwords, sensitive communications, or other data that might not be stored in files.
   - **Exfiltrating Data via FTP**: This is a common method for transferring stolen data back to the attackers' servers.

4. **Comparing with CosmicDuke's Known Behavior**: CosmicDuke has been observed to use various methods for data theft, including keylogging, screenshotting, and potentially stealing data from the clipboard. It is designed to gather as much information as possible from a compromised system, which aligns with the described TTPs.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the behaviors described and the known capabilities of CosmicDuke, it is plausible that after searching removable drives and collecting specific files, CosmicDuke would use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather more information before exfiltrating the data via FTP.

Final Answer: A
