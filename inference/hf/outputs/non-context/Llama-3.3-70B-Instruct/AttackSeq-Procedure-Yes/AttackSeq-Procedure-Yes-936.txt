To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Gathering Host Information**: This step typically involves techniques such as `Discovery` (TA0007) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary gathers information about the system, network, or organization. This can include system network configuration discovery, system information discovery, and more. This step is common after an adversary has gained initial access to a system.

2. **Successful Evasion Techniques**: Evasion techniques (such as `Defense Evasion` - TA0005) are used by adversaries to avoid detection. This can include code obfuscation, disabling security tools, or using secure communication channels that are less likely to be monitored.

3. **Establishing Communication with a C2 Server via DNS Tunneling**: DNS tunneling (part of `Command and Control` - TA0011, specifically `Application Layer Protocol: DNS` in the MITRE ATT&CK framework) is a technique used by adversaries to establish communication with a command and control (C2) server. This method is chosen for its ability to bypass traditional network defenses that might block other types of traffic. It involves encapsulating C2 communications within DNS queries and responses.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common attack patterns:
- An adversary gains access to a system.
- They gather information about the host to understand the environment and potential vulnerabilities.
- To maintain access without being detected, they use evasion techniques.
- Finally, they establish a covert channel for command and control, which could be through DNS tunneling, a method that is less commonly monitored than traditional HTTP or other protocols.

Therefore, after gathering host information and employing successful evasion techniques, it is plausible that a backdoor program would establish communication with a C2 server via DNS tunneling to receive further commands, as this method provides a relatively stealthy way to communicate with the compromised host.
