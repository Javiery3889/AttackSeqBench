To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) attributed to APT-TOCS, focusing on defense evasion techniques such as running in memory and using multi-beacon communication. It then inquires about the likelihood of APT-TOCS using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicating with compromised systems via HTTP GET requests during the command and control (C2) stage.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence mentioned involves:
   - Defense evasion through running in memory and multi-beacon communication.
   - Using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts.
   - Communicating with compromised systems via HTTP GET requests during the C2 stage.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques**: Running in memory and using multi-beacon communication are advanced techniques used by sophisticated threat actors to evade detection. These methods allow malware to operate without being detected by traditional security software.
   - **PowerShell Usage**: PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for various tasks, including downloading scripts. Its use by threat actors for malicious purposes, such as downloading encrypted data scripts, is well-documented. This aligns with the capabilities of advanced threat actors like APT groups.
   - **C2 Communication via HTTP GET Requests**: Using HTTP GET requests for C2 communication is a common technique. It allows the attackers to blend in with normal network traffic, making detection more challenging.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial techniques mentioned (running in memory and multi-beacon communication) suggest a sophisticated threat actor capable of advanced defense evasion.
   - **Step 2**: The use of PowerShell for malicious activities, such as downloading encrypted scripts, is consistent with the TTPs of sophisticated threat actors.
   - **Step 3**: Communicating with compromised systems via HTTP GET requests is a plausible C2 tactic, given its stealthy nature and the ability to mimic legitimate traffic.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the sophisticated nature of the initial defense evasion techniques and the common use of PowerShell and HTTP GET requests for malicious purposes, it is reasonable to conclude that APT-TOCS could indeed use these methods during the command and control stage.

**Final Answer: A**
