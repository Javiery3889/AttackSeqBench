To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior described in relation to known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with FIN13, a group known for its sophisticated cyber attacks, particularly in the financial sector.

1. **Leveraging WMI and custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement**: This indicates the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for moving laterally across a network. WMI is a part of the Windows operating system and can be used for various administrative tasks, including executing commands and managing systems remotely. Custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE suggest a high degree of sophistication and intent to evade detection. This behavior aligns with the "Lateral Movement" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques such as "T1021 - Remote Services" and potentially "T1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation".

2. **Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives**: After gaining access and moving laterally, collecting sensitive data is a common objective for many threat actors, including FIN13. This would involve techniques like "T1204 - User Execution" if the data is accessed through user-interaction or "T1005 - Data from Local System" if the data is collected directly from local systems. Collecting data from shared drives specifically could be seen as part of "T1025 - Data from Removable Media" or more broadly under "T1005".

3. **Staging it locally or remotely and archiving the collected data**: Staging data locally or remotely is a common step before exfiltration, allowing attackers to organize and prepare the data for transfer. This could involve creating archives or compressing files, which is part of the "Data Staging" tactic, specifically "T1074 - Data Staged".

4. **Targeting specific information to aid in fraudulent transactions**: FIN13, being a group focused on financial gain, would likely target information that could be used for fraudulent transactions, such as financial data, personal identifiable information (PII), or other sensitive business data. This aligns with the "Exfiltration" and "Collection" tactics, particularly techniques aimed at stealing sensitive information like "T1003 - OS Credential Dumping" or "T1552 - Unsecured Credentials".

Given these steps and the known objectives of FIN13, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining access and moving laterally within a network, FIN13 would indeed collect sensitive data, stage it, and then use this information to aid in fraudulent transactions. This sequence of actions aligns with the group's known TTPs and objectives.
