To answer this question, let's break down the key elements and analyze them in the context of a plausible sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions a Russian-language phishing campaign. Phishing is a common technique used for initial access (TA0001) where attackers trick victims into revealing sensitive information or gaining access to their systems. This aligns with the initial steps of many cyber attacks.

2. **Execution**: The exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter through malicious docx files containing obfuscated code is mentioned. This suggests the use of a vulnerability (CVE) for execution (TA0002), specifically exploiting a software vulnerability to execute malicious code on the victim's system. The use of obfuscated code is a technique (T1027) to make the code harder to understand and analyze, which is a common practice among attackers.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: The establishment of communication with a compromised server for command and control purposes is a critical step in the attack sequence. This involves the malware communicating with a C2 server (TA0011) to receive further instructions, which is a common technique used by attackers to maintain control over compromised systems.

Given these elements:
- The initial phishing campaign provides a plausible vector for **Initial Access**.
- The exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft's EPS filter through malicious docx files offers a means of **Execution**.
- The communication with a compromised server for C2 purposes aligns with the **Command and Control** phase of an attack.

Considering the sequence of TTPs:
1. Phishing for initial access.
2. Exploiting a vulnerability for execution.
3. Establishing C2 communication.

This sequence is consistent with known attack patterns and the tactics, techniques, and procedures outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Therefore, it is plausible that the described sequence of events could occur in a real-world attack scenario.
