To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the likelihood of the described sequence of events.

1. **Privilege Escalation Using Metasploit Module**: The question starts with the attacker using a Metasploit module (ext_server_priv.x86.dll) for privilege escalation. This module is designed to exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges on a compromised system, which is a common step in the attack chain to gain more control over the system.

2. **Contacting C&C Server**: After gaining elevated privileges, the next step mentioned is the shellcode contacting its Command and Control (C&C) server at https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ. This is a plausible next step as, after establishing a foothold and escalating privileges, attackers often use C&C servers to receive further instructions, download additional malware, or exfiltrate data.

3. **Domain Resolution for Malicious Activity**: The question also mentions the domain psychology-blog.ezua[.]com being resolved to the IP address 209.239.115[.]91 for further malicious activity. This could be part of the attacker's strategy to use domain name systems (DNS) for command and control, where the domain might be used as a fallback or for additional C&C communication, possibly to evade detection or to distribute the command and control infrastructure.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of events described is likely. Given the context, after successfully escalating privileges, it's reasonable for the attacker to use the compromised system to contact a C&C server for further instructions. The use of a specific domain resolving to the same IP as the C&C server could be part of the attacker's infrastructure for redundancy, failover, or evasion techniques.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the sequence is unlikely. However, based on common attack patterns, there's no inherent reason to believe that contacting a C&C server after privilege escalation and using a domain that resolves to the same IP for malicious activities is implausible.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial privilege escalation using a Metasploit module is a known tactic.
2. Contacting a C&C server post-escalation is a common next step for receiving further instructions.
3. Using a domain that resolves to the same IP as the C&C server could be for redundancy or evasion.

**Final Answer**: A
