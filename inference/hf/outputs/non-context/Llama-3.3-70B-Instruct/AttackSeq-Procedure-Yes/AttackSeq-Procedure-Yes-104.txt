To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step in the context of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the use of API hooking techniques to evade detection. API hooking is a method used by malware to intercept and modify the behavior of API calls within an operating system. The specific functions mentioned, 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable', are related to process manipulation and network communication, respectively. This suggests the malware is attempting to hide its activities, possibly related to process injection or network communications.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) here involves:
   - **Defense Evasion**: Through API hooking to modify system calls, which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique of "Hooking" (T1055).
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The mention of a backdoor configuration implies the establishment of a C2 channel, which is a common technique used by attackers to maintain access to compromised systems (T1021).

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **Encryption/Decryption Key and XOR-encrypted C&C Server Address**: The use of encryption keys for secure communication and XOR encryption for hiding the C2 server address are common techniques used by malware to protect their communications from being intercepted and understood by defenders. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique of "Encrypted Channel" (T1573) and "Symmetric Cryptography" could be considered for the encryption aspect.
   - Given the context of evading detection and establishing a backdoor, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would also employ encryption to protect its communications, making the backdoor's configuration likely to include such features.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware uses API hooking for evasion, indicating a level of sophistication.
   - The establishment of a backdoor implies the need for covert communication channels.
   - Encryption and XOR encryption are common methods for protecting these channels.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Waterbear's backdoor configuration would include an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address.

**Final Answer: A**
