To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that BlackSoul, presumably a threat actor or malware, might employ.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of actions by BlackSoul:
   - Retrieving files from the Cloudflare Workers service.
   - Utilizing Cloudflare Workers Service infrastructure to communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server.
   - Performing automated data exfiltration over the C2 channel.

2. **Identifying TTPs**:
   - **Retrieving files**: This could be related to the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary collects data of interest to their goal.
   - **Utilizing Cloudflare Workers for C2 communication**: This aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically using application layer protocols or existing services for C2 communication.
   - **Automated data exfiltration**: This is related to the "Exfiltration" tactic, where data is transferred from the victim network to the adversary's system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The question essentially asks if, after retrieving files, BlackSoul would use the Cloudflare Workers service as a means to communicate with its C2 server before exfiltrating the data.
   - Given the context, using Cloudflare Workers for C2 communication is plausible because it leverages existing infrastructure that might be less suspicious than setting up a new, potentially detectable C2 channel.
   - The sequence of retrieving files, communicating with the C2 server, and then exfiltrating data is a logical progression in a cyber attack aimed at stealing sensitive information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: BlackSoul retrieves files, indicating an interest in specific data.
   - **Step 2**: To facilitate further actions, such as exfiltration, communication with a C2 server is necessary for receiving instructions or transmitting stolen data.
   - **Step 3**: Utilizing Cloudflare Workers for this communication is a tactic that could provide a layer of obscurity or legitimacy to the communication, as it leverages a legitimate service.
   - **Step 4**: Finally, exfiltrating the data over the established C2 channel completes the objective of stealing the desired information.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the logical sequence of actions and the tactics involved, it is plausible that BlackSoul would utilize Cloudflare Workers Service infrastructure to communicate with its C2 server before performing automated data exfiltration.
