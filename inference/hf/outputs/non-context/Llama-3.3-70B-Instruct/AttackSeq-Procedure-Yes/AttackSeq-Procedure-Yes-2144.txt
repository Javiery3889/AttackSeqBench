To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Achieving Persistence**: The malware creates a RunOnce key in the registry. This is a technique (T1060) used for persistence, allowing the malware to execute once after a system reboot. This step is about maintaining access to the compromised system.

2. **Process Discovery**: The next step mentioned is process discovery, specifically identifying the explorer process. Process discovery (T1057) is a technique used by adversaries to gain information about the running processes on a system. Identifying the explorer process could be part of this, as it's a common process that an adversary might be interested in for various reasons, such as injecting code into it for persistence or evasion.

3. **Establishing Command and Control (C2) through Process Hollowing**: Process Hollowing (T1094) is a technique where a process is created in a suspended state, and its memory is replaced with malicious code. This technique can be used for establishing C2 communications, as it allows the malware to hide its communications within a legitimate process, making detection more difficult.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- **Persistence** is achieved through creating a RunOnce key, which is a common technique.
- **Process Discovery** by identifying the explorer process could logically follow as the malware seeks to understand the system's current state and running processes, potentially to decide on the best approach for further actions, such as which process to hollow for C2 communications.
- **Establishing C2 through Process Hollowing** is a sophisticated technique that could indeed follow process discovery, as the adversary would need to know which processes are running and suitable for hollowing to maintain stealthy C2 communications.

Considering these points, the sequence described in the question seems plausible. The malware first ensures it can persist on the system, then gathers information about running processes (which could include identifying the explorer process among others), and finally establishes a stealthy means of C2 communication through process hollowing.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The malware achieves persistence, which is a fundamental step in maintaining access.
2. It then performs process discovery, which is logical for planning subsequent actions, including potential process hollowing.
3. Establishing C2 through process hollowing is a sophisticated method for hiding communications, which aligns with the previous steps of ensuring persistence and gathering process information.

**Final Answer: A**
