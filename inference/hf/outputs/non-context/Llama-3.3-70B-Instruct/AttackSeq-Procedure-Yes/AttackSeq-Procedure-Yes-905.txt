To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions "Dexphot," which is known as a malware family, and its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), specifically "process hollowing" during the execution stage. Process hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is spawned, and then its memory is replaced with malicious code, allowing the malware to hide its activities under a legitimate process name. The question asks if, after using process hollowing, Dexphot is likely to utilize "fileless techniques" for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - **Process Hollowing**: This technique is used to evade detection by making malicious code appear as part of a legitimate process. It's a form of in-memory evasion technique.
   - **Fileless Techniques**: These involve executing malware directly in memory without writing any files to the disk. This makes detection harder since traditional signature-based detection methods rely on scanning files on disk.
   - Given that Dexphot already employs process hollowing, which is a sophisticated evasion technique, it suggests the malware is designed to avoid detection. Fileless techniques align with this goal by minimizing the malware's footprint on the system, making it harder for security software to detect.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand that process hollowing is a technique used for evasion, indicating Dexphot's intent to avoid detection.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize that fileless techniques serve a similar purposeâ€”evading detection by not leaving traditional malware signatures on disk.
   - **Step 3**: Since Dexphot is already using advanced evasion techniques like process hollowing, it is plausible that it would also utilize fileless techniques to further complicate detection efforts.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the nature of Dexphot's known behaviors and the goal of evasion, it is reasonable to conclude that Dexphot would likely utilize fileless techniques for defense evasion after using process hollowing.

**Final Answer: A**
