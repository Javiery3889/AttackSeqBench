To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) typically associated with such activities, keeping in mind the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Data Collection**: The initial step involves collecting data in SQLite databases. This action aligns with the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers gather information that can be used for future operations.

2. **Data Compression and Storage**: The data is then compressed into ZIP files and stored in hidden folders on external storage. This step can be associated with the "Collection" and "Exfiltration" tactics, as compressing data can be a preparatory step for exfiltration, making it easier to transfer. Storing it in hidden folders could be an attempt to evade detection, aligning with "Defense Evasion" tactics.

3. **Exfiltration Over C2 Channels**: The question then posits the exfiltration of this data over Command and Control (C2) channels to command and control servers. This directly aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic, where data is transferred from the victim network to the attacker's systems.

4. **Utilization of C2 Infrastructure for Data Storage or Exposure**: Finally, the C2 infrastructure is used to store or expose the exfiltrated data. This could involve further actions under the "Exfiltration" tactic, as well as potentially "Impact" tactics if the data is used for malicious purposes such as ransomware attacks or data leaks.

Given this sequence of events:
- The initial collection and preparation of data for exfiltration (compressing and hiding) suggest a deliberate attempt to gather and prepare data for transfer.
- The use of C2 channels for exfiltration is a common TTP among threat actors for transferring stolen data from a compromised network to their controlled servers.
- The subsequent use of the C2 infrastructure for storing or exposing the data aligns with typical post-exfiltration activities, where stolen data might be stored for later use, sold, or exposed publicly.

Considering these points, it is logical to conclude that after collecting, compressing, and storing data in a manner that suggests preparation for exfiltration, the next steps would indeed involve exfiltrating this data over C2 channels to command and control servers, followed by the utilization of this infrastructure for storing or exposing the exfiltrated data.
