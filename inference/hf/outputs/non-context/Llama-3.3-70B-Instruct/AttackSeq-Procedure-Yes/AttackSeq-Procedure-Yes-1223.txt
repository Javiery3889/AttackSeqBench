To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Credential Theft**: The use of Mimikatz for credential theft suggests that the attackers are interested in gaining access to sensitive credentials within the network. Mimikatz is a tool known for its ability to extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN codes, and kerberos tickets from memory.

2. **Access to Domain Controller and Deployment of Trochilus**: Accessing the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller and deploying Trochilus (a malware associated with APT10, a Chinese threat actor group) indicates an attempt to further compromise the network, potentially for espionage or other malicious activities. Copying the NTDS.DIT database file provides the attackers with a wealth of information about the network's users and structure.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The question then asks about logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts. Given that APT10 has already compromised the domain controller and has the capability to use stolen credentials, it is plausible that they would use these credentials for lateral movement within the network. Using valid user accounts would allow them to blend in with normal network activity, making their actions less suspicious.

4. **Exhibiting Logins Consistent with Tianjin, China Working Hours**: APT10 is a Chinese threat actor group. It is common for threat actors to operate during their local working hours, as it allows them to respond quickly to any issues that arise during their operations and blend their malicious activity with normal network usage patterns. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that their activity might follow the working hours of their presumed location, in this case, Tianjin, China.

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs described aligns well with known behaviors of APT10 and common tactics used in network compromises for espionage or other malicious purposes. The use of stolen credentials for lateral movement and the pattern of activity consistent with the threat actor's presumed location and working hours are both plausible next steps in the attack sequence.
