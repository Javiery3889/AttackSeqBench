To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Discovery Phase**: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit. 
   - **SharpHound** is a tool used for gathering information about the target environment, such as Active Directory structure, which aligns with the Discovery phase (TA0007 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework). It helps in understanding the network layout and potential vulnerabilities.
   - **PowerSploit** is a collection of PowerShell scripts that can be used for various purposes, including exploiting vulnerabilities and evading detection. Loading it directly into memory suggests an attempt to avoid detection and persistence, which is also consistent with actions taken during the Discovery phase to gather more information without being detected.

2. **Lateral Movement Phase**: The question then asks about accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader.
   - **Accessing shared folders over SMB** is a common method for lateral movement (T1021 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework), allowing an attacker to move laterally within a network by exploiting shared network resources.
   - **Dropping a web shell loader like NodeIISWeb** is a technique used for establishing persistence and potentially for further lateral movement or command and control (C2) communications. Web shells can provide a backdoor into a network, enabling an attacker to execute commands on a compromised web server.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of an attack:
- **Reconnaissance and Discovery** using SharpHound and PowerSploit to understand the network and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Lateral Movement** by accessing shared folders over SMB to move within the network and compromise additional servers.
- **Establishing Persistence** through the use of a web shell loader like NodeIISWeb, which can facilitate further malicious activities.

Therefore, it is plausible that after performing reconnaissance and gathering information, an attacker like TG1021 would attempt to access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop a web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.
