To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluating the plausibility of the scenario described:

1. **Analyzing the Question**:
   - The question describes a scenario where malware (Aumlib and Ixeshe) evades detection by altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques.
   - It then asks if it's likely that Aumlib malware will download its updated sample from specific URLs and share code with an older variant as part of the attackers' command and control (C2) activity.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial TTP involves evasion techniques (altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding) to avoid detection.
   - The subsequent actions involve downloading updated malware samples from specific URLs and sharing code with an older variant, which are part of C2 activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Evasion Techniques**: Malware using encoding to evade detection is a common TTP. This aligns with the initial step of avoiding detection.
   - **Downloading Updated Samples**: It's a plausible next step for malware to download updated samples from specific URLs as part of its C2 communication. This allows the malware to receive new instructions, update its capabilities, or modify its behavior to maintain persistence and evade detection further.
   - **Sharing Code with Older Variants**: This could be part of the malware's evolution, where new variants incorporate successful elements from older versions, or it could be a mechanism to ensure compatibility with different environments or to confuse attribution efforts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware evades detection, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, allowing the malware to establish a foothold without being noticed.
   - **Step 2**: Downloading updated samples from specific URLs is a logical next step for maintaining the malware's effectiveness and ensuring the attackers can adapt their strategy as needed.
   - **Step 3**: Sharing code with an older variant could be a strategic decision to leverage proven components, reduce development time, or increase the malware's resilience against detection and removal efforts.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the context and the typical behaviors of sophisticated malware, it is reasonable to conclude that after evading detection, the Aumlib malware would engage in activities such as downloading updated samples and potentially sharing code with older variants as part of its C2 activities. This behavior aligns with known patterns of malware operation and the continuous evolution of threats in the cyber landscape.
