To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the described attack sequence and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence based on the information provided and general knowledge of cyber attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access (TA0001)**: The initial access technique involves the attacker gaining an initial foothold within a network. Exploiting a vulnerability like CVE-2020-35730 in the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers could indeed serve as a viable method for initial access. This aligns with the "Exploit Public-Facing Application" technique (T1190) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary exploits a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access to the system.

2. **Discovery (TA0007)**: After gaining initial access, the next step mentioned involves conducting discovery activities. This could include gathering information about system and network configurations, which is a common post-exploitation activity. Techniques such as "System Network Configuration Discovery" (T1016) and "System Information Discovery" (T1082) are relevant here. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software could provide the necessary access and privileges to perform these discovery activities.

Given the context and the TTPs involved:
- The initial exploitation of CVE-2020-35730 for gaining access to the mail servers is plausible as it aligns with known attack vectors.
- The subsequent exploitation of vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail for discovery activities is also plausible, as once an attacker has access to a system, exploiting additional vulnerabilities to escalate privileges or move laterally is a common tactic.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of attack techniques and the alignment with known TTPs, the described sequence of events is indeed plausible.
