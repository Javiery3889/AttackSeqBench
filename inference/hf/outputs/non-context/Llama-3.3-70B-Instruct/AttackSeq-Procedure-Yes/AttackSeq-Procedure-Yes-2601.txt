To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the malware as described:

1. **Gathering System Information**: The malware, NanHaiShu, starts by collecting system information from the infected machine. This is a common initial step for many types of malware, as understanding the environment can help in deciding the next steps, such as whether to proceed with the infection, what type of payload to deliver, or how to maintain persistence.

2. **Uploading to C&C Server**: After gathering system information, the malware uploads this data to a Command and Control (C&C) server. This action suggests that the malware is designed to communicate with its operators or other components of the malware infrastructure, likely to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate sensitive data.

3. **Using Dynamic DNS Providers**: The question then posits that the malware might use dynamic DNS (Domain Name System) providers to communicate with the C&C servers. Dynamic DNS is a method of updating a domain name's IP address in real-time, which can be useful for malware operators. It allows them to quickly change the IP address associated with a domain name, potentially evading detection by security systems that block traffic based on known malicious IP addresses.

4. **Uploading Encoded System Information**: The mention of uploading "encoded system information" implies an attempt to conceal the nature of the communication. Encoding or encrypting the data makes it harder for security tools and analysts to understand the content of the communication without additional effort to decode or decrypt it.

5. **Switching IP Addresses**: Finally, the question mentions a switch from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address. This could be part of an effort to mislead investigators about the origin or intentions of the malware, or it could reflect a change in the operational infrastructure of the malware operators.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that it is likely the malware will engage in the described behavior. Given the context, using dynamic DNS to maintain communication with C&C servers while trying to evade detection, encoding data for secrecy, and changing IP addresses to mislead or reconfigure operational infrastructure are all plausible tactics for sophisticated malware.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that such behavior is unlikely. However, given the common use of dynamic DNS, encoding, and IP address changes as evasion techniques in malware operations, this seems less likely to be the correct answer.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The malware's initial actions (gathering and uploading system information) are typical for setting up a foothold in a compromised system.
2. The use of dynamic DNS and encoding are recognized tactics for evading detection and maintaining operational security.
3. Changing IP addresses, especially to a different geographical location, could be part of an attempt to obscure the malware's origins or operational base.

**Final Answer**: A
