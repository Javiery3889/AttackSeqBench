To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned, relating them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the behavior of the threat actor group FIN13.

1. **Analysis of the Question**:
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by FIN13, starting with the use of trojanized KeePass binaries for logging newly entered passwords during privilege escalation.
   - The actions mentioned involve:
     1. **Initial Access and Privilege Escalation**: Using trojanized KeePass binaries to capture new passwords, which aligns with the "Credential Access" tactic (TA0006) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Input Capture" technique (T1056).
     2. **Credential Access**: Obtaining credentials through network sniffing, which corresponds to the "Network Sniffing" technique (T1040) under the "Credential Access" tactic.
     3. **Discovery**: Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for gathering network and host configuration details, which falls under the "Discovery" tactic (TA0007), including techniques like "System Network Configuration Discovery" (T1016) and "System Information Discovery" (T1082).

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **FIN13's TTPs**: FIN13 is known for sophisticated operations, including the use of custom malware and leveraging native OS tools for reconnaissance and credential harvesting. The use of trojanized software for initial access and credential capture is consistent with advanced threat actors' methods.
   - **Plausibility of Network Sniffing**: Given the context of already having access to the network (as implied by the ability to use trojanized binaries for password capture), employing network sniffing to obtain additional credentials is a plausible next step. This would align with the goal of maximizing the information gathered during the intrusion.
   - **Use of Native Binaries and Custom Malware for Reconnaissance**: This action is consistent with the tactics of sophisticated threat actors like FIN13, who often seek to blend in with normal network activity by using native tools and also employ custom tools for more specific or evasive reconnaissance tasks.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries to capture new passwords, indicating an interest in credential access and potentially lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - **Step 2**: The question of whether FIN13 would employ network sniffing to obtain credentials before moving on to more detailed reconnaissance is evaluated. Given the group's sophistication and the goal of maximizing credential collection, network sniffing is a logical step.
   - **Step 3**: The use of native OS binaries and custom malware for gathering network and host configuration details is a common practice among advanced threat actors for internal reconnaissance, fitting FIN13's profile.

**Final Answer: A**
