To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, including those attributed to Dropping Elephant, a group known for sophisticated cyber operations.

1. **Initial Access through Spear-Phishing**: The initial access vector mentioned involves spear-phishing emails exploiting specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352). This is a common TTP for gaining initial access, as seen in many cyber attacks. Spear-phishing emails are often used to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on links that exploit vulnerabilities.

2. **Use of a UPX Packed Backdoor**: After gaining initial access, the use of a UPX packed backdoor is mentioned. UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) is a tool used to compress executables, making them smaller and sometimes harder to detect by security software. Threat actors often use packers like UPX to evade detection. The use of a backdoor, especially one packed with UPX, aligns with common post-exploitation TTPs to maintain access and evade detection.

3. **Downloading PowerShell Command Line Scripts**: The next step involves downloading PowerShell command line scripts for execution. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including executing scripts that can perform malicious activities such as reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Threat actors frequently use PowerShell for these purposes due to its native presence on Windows systems and its ability to execute scripts in memory, making it harder to detect.

4. **Employing Encoded Blobs for Defense Evasion**: Finally, the question mentions employing encoded blobs for defense evasion techniques. Encoded blobs can refer to encoded data or scripts that are decoded and executed in memory, which is a technique used to evade detection by traditional signature-based security controls. This aligns with the TTPs of sophisticated threat actors who continually update their methods to evade detection.

Given the sequence of TTPs described:
- **Initial Access** through spear-phishing emails exploiting known vulnerabilities is a common entry point.
- The use of a **UPX packed backdoor** for maintaining access and evading detection is plausible.
- **Downloading and executing PowerShell scripts** is a known method for post-exploitation activities.
- **Employing encoded blobs** for defense evasion is consistent with advanced evasion techniques.

Considering these points, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with known sophisticated cyber attack methodologies. Therefore, it is plausible that Dropping Elephant, or any sophisticated threat actor, could use such a sequence of TTPs for their operations.
