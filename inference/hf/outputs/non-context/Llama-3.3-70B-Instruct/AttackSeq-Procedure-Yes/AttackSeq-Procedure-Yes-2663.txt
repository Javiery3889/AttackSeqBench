To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the infected computers communicating with a command and control (C2) server under the given conditions.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers have successfully executed 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' on infected SK Communications computers. This backdoor allows for remote access to these compromised systems. Additionally, the attackers installed more malware to access user databases, indicating a multi-stage attack aimed at data exfiltration or further system compromise.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Initial Access**: The execution of 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' suggests that initial access has been gained, potentially through phishing, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or other means.
   - **Persistence**: Installing a backdoor ensures persistence, allowing attackers to maintain access to the system even after initial access might have been closed off.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The establishment of a backdoor typically involves setting up a C2 channel for issuing commands to the compromised system.
   - **Data Access**: The installation of additional malware for accessing user databases indicates an interest in data exfiltration or manipulation.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The question posits that the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41. This could be a C2 server's domain, used by the attackers to communicate with the compromised systems.
   - Given that backdoors are typically used to maintain access and issue commands, and considering the additional malware for database access, it is plausible that the infected computers would communicate with a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers have established a backdoor, indicating a need for persistent access and command execution on the compromised systems.
   - **Step 2**: The installation of additional malware for database access suggests that data exfiltration or manipulation is a goal, which often requires communication with a C2 server for command issuance and data transfer.
   - **Step 3**: The resolution of 'update.alyac.org' to a specific IP address provides a potential C2 channel endpoint, which the compromised systems could communicate with to receive commands or send stolen data.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the establishment of a backdoor and the installation of additional malware for database access, it is reasonable to conclude that the infected computers would indeed communicate with a C2 server, especially if 'update.alyac.org' is identified as a C2 domain resolving to a specific IP address.

**Final Answer: A**
