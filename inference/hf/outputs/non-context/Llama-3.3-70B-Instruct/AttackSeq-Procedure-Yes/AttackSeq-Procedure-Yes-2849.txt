To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The question starts with PowerShell scripts downloading a Windows executable and a decoy document. This action suggests that the attacker has already gained initial access to the system and is executing their payload, which is a common technique used in the early stages of an attack to establish a foothold.

2. **Execution Phase**: The execution phase involves running the attacker's code on the victim's system. The use of PowerShell scripts to download additional files (a Windows executable and a decoy document) indicates that the attacker is likely using the system to further their goals, possibly by installing additional malware or tools.

3. **Command and Control (C2) Phase**: During the C2 phase, the attacker typically establishes a communication channel with the compromised system to issue commands, exfiltrate data, or download additional malware. The question mentions the possibility of the downloader retrieving an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during this phase.

Given this sequence, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: It is plausible that during the C2 phase, the attacker would download additional tools or malware to further compromise the system or to use it for other malicious purposes. Asruex malware, being encoded within an image file, could be a tactic used to evade detection by traditional security software. This aligns with common techniques used by attackers to maintain access and expand their control over a compromised system.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that downloading an image file with encoded malware during the C2 phase is unlikely. However, given the context that the system is already compromised and the attacker is actively using it to download and execute files, it seems less likely that this option is correct.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attacker has already gained access to the system and is executing PowerShell scripts to download additional files.
2. The execution of these scripts and the download of a Windows executable and a decoy document indicate an active attempt to compromise the system further.
3. The command and control phase is a critical part of the attack lifecycle where attackers often download additional malware or tools to achieve their objectives.
4. Downloading an image file with encoded Asruex malware fits within the tactics commonly used during the C2 phase to evade detection and further compromise the system.

**Final Answer: A**
