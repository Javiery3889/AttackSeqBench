To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Defense Evasion Techniques**: The question starts with the utilization of defense evasion techniques such as process injection and deobfuscation. This implies the attacker is trying to avoid detection, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to maintain access and gather information without being detected.

2. **Process Discovery and System Time Discovery**: After evading defenses, the next steps mentioned are process discovery and system time discovery. Process discovery (T1007) involves techniques used to get information about running processes on a system, which can help in identifying potential targets for further exploitation or in understanding the system's current state. System time discovery (T1124) involves gathering information about the system's time, which can be useful for synchronizing actions or understanding the system's configuration.

3. **Archiving Collected Data**: Finally, the question mentions archiving collected data using a custom storage file format. This step implies that after gathering necessary information (possibly through process and system time discovery), the malware is designed to store this information in a way that might not be easily detectable or readable by security software.

Given this sequence:
- The initial defense evasion techniques are used to establish a foothold and gather information about the SombRAT backdoor.
- The subsequent use of process discovery and system time discovery capabilities would logically follow as a means to understand the environment better, identify potential targets, and possibly schedule or synchronize malicious activities.
- Finally, archiving collected data in a custom format would be a way to store the gathered intelligence securely and possibly exfiltrate it.

Considering the logical progression of these TTPs and their alignment with common attack patterns outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is reasonable to conclude that the sequence described is plausible and follows a logical attack strategy.

Final Answer: A
