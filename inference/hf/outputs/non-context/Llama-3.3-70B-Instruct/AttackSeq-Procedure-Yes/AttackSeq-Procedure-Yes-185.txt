To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence occurring as described.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by an adversary, Infamous Chisel, which includes:
     1. Collecting files from application and data directories that contain communication data.
     2. Enumerating data directories to discover files of interest.
     3. Collecting GPS information.
     4. Automatically exfiltrating these files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - **Collecting files from application and data directories** aligns with the technique of "Collection" (T1213) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary gathers information relevant to their goals.
   - **Enumerating data directories to discover files of interest** can be seen as part of the "Discovery" tactic (TA0007), specifically techniques like "File and Directory Discovery" (T1083), where an adversary attempts to get a list of files and directories to identify potential targets for exfiltration or further exploitation.
   - **Collecting GPS information** could be related to "Collection" (T1213) as well, focusing on geolocation data, possibly for tracking or identifying the location of the compromised device or system.
   - **Automatically exfiltrating files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections** corresponds to the "Exfiltration" tactic (TA0010), specifically using "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" (T1048) and possibly "Encrypted Channel" (T1573) for secure data transfer.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with collecting specific data, which is a common initial step in cyber attacks to gather intelligence or valuable information.
   - Enumerating data directories to find files of interest is a logical next step after initial data collection, as it helps in identifying what else might be valuable or relevant to the adversary's goals.
   - Collecting GPS information could serve various purposes, including enhancing the adversary's understanding of the target's movements or locations, which might be relevant depending on the adversary's objectives.
   - Finally, exfiltrating the collected data using secure and anonymous channels like Tor hidden services and SSH connections is a typical method used by adversaries to securely transfer stolen data without being detected.

Given the logical progression of these steps and their alignment with common adversary TTPs as described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it seems plausible that after collecting initial files, an adversary would continue to enumerate the system for more data, collect specific information like GPS data if relevant to their goals, and then exfiltrate the data using secure methods.

**Final Answer: A**
