To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a threat actor, associated with the StellarParticle campaign, has been observed using tools like AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets. These tools are used for discovery activities, specifically to gather information about the Active Directory. The question then asks if it's likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied here involves:
   - **Discovery**: Using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to gather Active Directory information. This aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like T1069 (Permission Groups Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery).
   - **Lateral Movement**: The question mentions moving laterally through the environment, which is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework (Tactic: Lateral Movement). Using RDP (T1021.001) is a technique under this tactic.
   - **Accessing Data**: Finally, accessing data from Information Repositories can be related to the "Collection" tactic, specifically techniques like T1005 (Data from Local System) or T1213 (Data from Information Repositories).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally makes sense because threat actors often attempt to use the path of least resistance and may initially use non-privileged accounts for reconnaissance before escalating privileges or using already compromised privileged accounts for more sensitive actions.
   - The fact that the threat actor has already demonstrated the ability to gather detailed information about the Active Directory suggests they are capable of sophisticated actions, including lateral movement and data access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The threat actor has shown the capability to perform discovery activities, indicating an interest in understanding the target environment.
   - **Step 2**: The use of RDP for lateral movement is a common technique, especially if the threat actor has compromised credentials, which seems plausible given their ability to gather detailed Active Directory information.
   - **Step 3**: Accessing data from Information Repositories is a logical next step after lateral movement, as the actor would likely seek to extract valuable data.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the context and the steps outlined, it is reasonable to conclude that the threat actor would use both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally and then access data, as this aligns with common patterns of behavior observed in cyber attacks.

Final Answer: A
