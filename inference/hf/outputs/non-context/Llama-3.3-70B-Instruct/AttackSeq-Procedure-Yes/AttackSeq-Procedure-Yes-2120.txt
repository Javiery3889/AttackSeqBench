To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The attackers are using "fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader." This technique involves loading malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process without writing any files to disk, which is a common method to evade detection. DESLoader is known for its ability to load and execute malicious DLLs, facilitating the initial stages of an attack.

2. **Software Discovery**: The question mentions the use of WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) for software discovery. WMIC is a powerful tool that allows for the management and querying of system information, including software installations, running processes, and much more. Attackers often use WMIC to gather information about the target environment, which helps in planning further actions, such as identifying potential vulnerabilities or understanding the network layout.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The question suggests that after software discovery, the attackers will heavily utilize RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for lateral movement. RDP is a protocol that allows users to remotely connect to another computer over a network. Attackers often exploit weak RDP configurations or compromised credentials to move laterally within a network, accessing additional servers or systems.

Given these TTPs, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- **Initial Execution**: The use of fileless implants via DLL side-loading is a sophisticated method for initial access, indicating a level of expertise and intent to evade detection.
- **Software Discovery**: Using WMIC for software discovery aligns with the need for attackers to understand their environment post-initial access. It's a logical step to gather intelligence on the target system and network before proceeding.
- **Lateral Movement via RDP**: If the attackers have successfully gained access to a system and have identified potential targets within the network (through software discovery), using RDP for lateral movement is a plausible next step, especially if they have obtained or can obtain valid credentials.

Considering these points, the sequence of TTPs described in the question follows a logical and coherent attack pattern. The use of sophisticated initial access methods, followed by reconnaissance (software discovery), and then lateral movement to expand access within the network, is consistent with the behaviors of advanced threat actors like A41APT.
