To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with threat actors like Gallmaker.

1. **Initiating the Attack with Microsoft Office DDE Protocol Exploitation**: The attack starts with exploiting the Microsoft Office DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol to execute commands in memory. This technique allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands without writing any files to disk, which can help in evading traditional signature-based detection mechanisms. This initial step is plausible as it aligns with known TTPs used by various threat actors to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Using Windows Roaming Tools/Task for Scheduling PowerShell Scripts and Tasks**: After gaining initial access, the use of tools like Windows Roaming for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks is a logical next step. This would enable the attackers to maintain persistence on the compromised system, schedule further malicious activities, and potentially escalate privileges. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for a wide range of post-exploitation activities, including reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.

3. **Employing Living Off the Land (LotL) Tactics**: Living off the land tactics involve using existing tools and software on the compromised system to carry out malicious activities, rather than introducing new, potentially detectable malware. This approach is favored by sophisticated threat actors as it makes detection more challenging. Given that the initial steps involve executing commands in memory and using native tools like PowerShell, transitioning to LotL tactics for further operations, evasion, and potentially removing tools from victim machines to cover tracks is a coherent and sophisticated approach.

Considering these steps, the sequence described aligns well with advanced threat actor TTPs, including initial exploitation, establishing persistence, and evading detection through LotL tactics. Therefore, it is plausible that Gallmaker or similar threat actors would employ such a sequence of TTPs to achieve their objectives while minimizing detection.
