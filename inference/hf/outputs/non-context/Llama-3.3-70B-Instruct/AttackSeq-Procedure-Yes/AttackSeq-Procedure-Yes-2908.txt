To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Action**: The use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials. Mimikatz is a tool used for extracting credentials from Windows systems, which aligns with the technique "Credential Dumping" (T1003) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Gaining domain administrator credentials would provide an adversary with significant access and control over the network.

2. **Subsequent Action**: The use of a stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network. This action aligns with the technique "Valid Accounts" (T1078) and possibly "Application Access Token" (T1098), depending on how the VPN certificate is used. The use of a stolen VPN certificate would allow an adversary to access the network remotely, appearing as a legitimate user.

3. **Final Action**: Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution. This action aligns with the technique "Remote Access Tools" (T1219) and "Command and Control" (T1566 and T1567), as backdoors are used to maintain access to a compromised system and can be used for executing commands.

Given this sequence of actions:
- **Step 1** provides the necessary credentials for elevated access.
- **Step 2** utilizes those credentials (or other means of access) to gain remote access to the network, which is a logical next step after gaining credentials to further the attack without being physically present on the network.
- **Step 3** involves deploying tools for maintaining access and executing commands, which is a common objective after gaining access to a network.

Considering the logical progression of an attack where an adversary seeks to gain access, maintain access, and then use that access to execute further malicious actions, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known TTPs used by APT groups.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial use of Mimikatz for credential dumping is a common technique used by adversaries to gain elevated access.
2. Utilizing a stolen VPN certificate for remote access is a logical next step to access the network without detection, leveraging the gained credentials or other access means.
3. Deploying backdoors for command and control is a typical action after establishing a foothold in a network, allowing for persistent access and the ability to execute further malicious activities.

**Final Answer: A**
