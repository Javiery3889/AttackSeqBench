To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tools and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Compromise**: The GreyEnergy group starts by compromising a computer. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where the attacker gains an initial foothold into the target network.

2. **Network Mapping and Credential Collection**: The use of tools like Nmap for network mapping and Mimikatz for credential collection indicates the attackers are interested in understanding the network layout and gathering credentials that could be used for further access. Nmap helps in identifying hosts, services, and operating systems on the network, while Mimikatz is used to extract passwords, hash, PIN codes, and kerberos tickets from memory, allowing the attackers to move laterally within the network using stolen credentials.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The question then asks about the likelihood of using SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools for lateral movement. PsExec is a tool that allows for the execution of processes on remote systems, which is a common technique for lateral movement. WinExe could be a typo or confusion with "WinExec," but in the context of Windows and lateral movement, tools like PsExec are indeed used. The SysInternals suite, which includes PsExec, is often utilized by both system administrators and attackers for executing commands and programs on remote computers.

Given the context and the tools mentioned:
- **GreyEnergy mini** for initial compromise,
- **Nmap** and **Mimikatz** for network mapping and credential collection,
it is logical that the next step would involve using tools that facilitate lateral movement across the compromised network. **PsExec** is specifically designed for this purpose, allowing attackers to execute commands and programs on remote systems, which aligns with the goal of spreading through the network after initial compromise and credential collection.

Therefore, considering the sequence of TTPs and the specific tools mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that the GreyEnergy group would use tools like SysInternals PsExec (and potentially other similar tools, with "WinExe" possibly being a misnomer or less relevant in this specific context) for lateral movement.
