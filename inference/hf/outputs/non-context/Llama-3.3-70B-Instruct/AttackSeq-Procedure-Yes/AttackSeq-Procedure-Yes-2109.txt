To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common threat actor behaviors as understood through the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Acquiring a Server**: Threat actors might acquire a server either by compromising an existing one or purchasing it, which aligns with the "Resource Development" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This step is about setting up infrastructure for their operations.

2. **Tuning Configurations**: After acquiring the server, tuning its configurations could involve setting up the environment to support their malicious activities. This could include configuring firewall rules, setting up malware command and control (C2) channels, and ensuring the server can communicate with compromised hosts.

3. **Accessing the Server**: Threat actors would need to access the server to configure it for their use. Common methods include using panel login (for web-based administration panels), SSH (Secure Shell for secure remote access), or RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol for Windows-based systems). These methods align with the "Remote Service Session Hijacking" or "Valid Accounts" techniques under the "Initial Access" or "Persistence" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Exposing the Malware Controller**: Exposing a malware controller on a port to administer commands to infections refers to setting up a command and control (C2) server. This is a critical step for managing malware infections, issuing updates, and executing commands on compromised systems. This action aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of setting up infrastructure, accessing it, and then using it to control malware infections. Therefore, it is plausible that after acquiring and configuring a server, threat actors would access it via common remote access methods (panel login, SSH, or RDP) before setting up a C2 channel to manage their malware infections.
