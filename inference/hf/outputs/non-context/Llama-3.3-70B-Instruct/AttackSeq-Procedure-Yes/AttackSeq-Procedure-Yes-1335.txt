To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access and Lateral Movement**: The scenario starts with the use of a net use command, which is typically used for mapping network drives or connecting to shared resources on a network. This action suggests an attempt at lateral movement within a network, likely following initial access to the network. The use of a ping command to confirm communication with the target device indicates an attempt to verify connectivity before proceeding with further actions.

2. **Establishment of Command and Control (C2)**: The mention of the version RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware indicates that the attackers have established a remote shell, which is a common method for maintaining access to a compromised system. This allows the attackers to execute commands remotely.

3. **LODEINFO Malware and C2 Communication**: LODEINFO is known to be malware that can be used for various malicious purposes, including data exfiltration and command and control. The question posits that after establishing a foothold and attempting lateral movement, LODEINFO malware would carry out HTTP POST communications with a C2 server.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the likelihood of LODEINFO carrying out HTTP POST communication with the C2 server for command and control:

- **Tactical Consistency**: The sequence described involves initial access, lateral movement, and the establishment of a remote shell. These actions are consistent with a sophisticated attack aimed at gaining and maintaining access to a network for further exploitation.
  
- **Technical Feasibility**: LODEINFO, as malware, is capable of communicating with C2 servers. Using HTTP POST requests is a common method for such communication because it can blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.

- **Logical Progression**: After gaining access and attempting to move laterally within the network, the next logical step for an attacker would be to establish a reliable means of command and control. This would involve communicating with a C2 server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

Based on this analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with common attack patterns observed in the wild. The use of malware like LODEINFO for C2 communication is plausible and consistent with the tactics employed by sophisticated threat actors.
