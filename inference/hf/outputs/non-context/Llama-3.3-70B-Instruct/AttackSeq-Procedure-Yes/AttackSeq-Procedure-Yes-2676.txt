To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Step**: ZoxPNG begins communication with the victim's machine. This implies an initial infection or access vector has been established.
2. **TTP Mentioned**: The use of the WinInet API to exploit proxy settings for defense evasion. This is a technique used for evading defenses by manipulating how the malware communicates through the victim's network, potentially to avoid detection by making its communication appear more legitimate or by routing its traffic in a way that bypasses security controls.
3. **Question Focus**: The likelihood of establishing contact with a Command and Control (C2) server via an initial HTTP GET request for command and control after the initial communication and defense evasion technique.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after establishing communication and evading defenses by exploiting proxy settings, the next logical step for ZoxPNG would be to establish contact with its C2 server. Using an HTTP GET request is a common method for initial C2 communication because it blends in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect. This aligns with typical malware behavior post-infection, where the malware needs to receive further instructions or upload stolen data.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that establishing contact with the C2 server via an HTTP GET request would not be a likely next step. However, given the context of needing to communicate with a C2 server for further instructions or to exfiltrate data, and considering the use of HTTP for its stealthiness, this option seems less likely unless the malware uses a significantly different and less common communication method.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The malware has already established communication with the victim's machine.
2. It has used the WinInet API for defense evasion, indicating an attempt to hide or disguise its communication.
3. The next logical step for the malware would be to communicate with its C2 server to receive instructions or upload data.
4. Using an HTTP GET request for this purpose is common due to its ability to blend in with normal traffic.

**Final Answer**: A
