To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that groups like BitterAPT might use, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The first step in any cyber attack is gaining initial access to the target network or system. Common techniques for initial access include phishing, drive-by compromise (exploiting vulnerabilities in software to gain access when a user visits a compromised website), and spearphishing attachment or link, among others.

2. **Execution**: After gaining initial access, attackers need to execute their malicious code on the victim's system. This could involve running a command or script, or executing a malicious executable.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: Once malware is executed on a victim's system, establishing a command and control channel is crucial for the attackers to issue commands, receive stolen data, and maintain access. This often involves setting up C2 servers.

Given the context of the question, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs:

- **Developing Malware (BitterRAT)**: The development of malware is a precursor to its use in attacks. BitterRAT, being a remote access trojan, would be used for establishing control over victim machines, data exfiltration, and potentially for further malicious activities.

- **Utilizing Compromised Websites and Phishing Schemes**: These are common methods for distributing malware. Phishing schemes can trick users into installing malware, while compromised websites can automatically download malware onto visiting devices (drive-by download).

- **Setting Up Command and Control Servers**: After infecting victim machines, setting up C2 servers like blitzchatlog.ddns.net is essential for managing the malware, issuing commands, and exfiltrating data.

Considering these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common attack patterns:

1. **Develop Malware**: BitterAPT develops BitterRAT.
2. **Initial Access**: They use compromised websites and phishing schemes to distribute BitterRAT.
3. **Establish C2**: After successful infection, they set up C2 servers for communication and data exfiltration.

This sequence is logical and aligns with known TTPs used by threat actors. Therefore, it is plausible that BitterAPT would utilize compromised websites and phishing schemes to distribute their threats before setting up Command and Control servers.
