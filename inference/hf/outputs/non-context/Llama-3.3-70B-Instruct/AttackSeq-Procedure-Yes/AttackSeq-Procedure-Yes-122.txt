To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of each step in relation to known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with threat actors like Agrius.

1. **Initial Access via Exploitation of Public-Facing Applications**: The question starts with the exploitation of public-facing applications to gain initial access. This is a common TTP, often associated with various threat actors. The mention of CVE-2018-13379, a known vulnerability, aligns with how attackers might exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in public-facing applications for initial access.

2. **Use of Webshells for Tunneling RDP Traffic**: After gaining initial access, the use of webshells to tunnel RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) traffic is a plausible next step. Webshells can provide a means to interact with a compromised web server and can be used to tunnel other traffic, including RDP, to move laterally within a network or to establish a more stable foothold.

3. **Leveraging Compromised Accounts for Lateral Movement**: This step involves using compromised credentials to move laterally within the network. This is a common technique used by threat actors to expand their access and reach more sensitive areas of the network.

4. **Communication with C2 Servers Using 'IPsec Helper' Backdoor over HTTP**: The final step mentioned involves communicating with Command and Control (C2) servers using a specific backdoor ('IPsec Helper') over HTTP. The use of backdoors for C2 communication is a well-documented TTP, and using HTTP as a protocol can help blend in with normal network traffic, making detection more challenging.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is plausible for Agrius. Considering the steps outlined, each action (exploiting public-facing applications, using webshells for tunneling, leveraging compromised accounts, and communicating with C2 servers via a backdoor) is a known TTP that could be used by sophisticated threat actors like Agrius.

- **B: No** - This choice implies that the sequence is not plausible. However, without specific information contradicting the use of these TTPs by Agrius or indicating that these steps are implausible in a cyber attack context, there's no clear reason to dismiss the sequence outright.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial exploitation of public-facing applications is a common entry point.
2. The use of webshells for tunneling RDP traffic is a feasible method for establishing a more stable presence.
3. Leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement is a standard technique.
4. Communicating with C2 servers via a backdoor over HTTP is a known method for maintaining access.

**Final Answer**: A
