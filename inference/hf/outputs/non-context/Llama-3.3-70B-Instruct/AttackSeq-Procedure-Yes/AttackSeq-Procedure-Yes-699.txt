To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the situation based on the information provided and general knowledge about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by sophisticated threat actors like those associated with the Elderwood Project.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where attackers, associated with the Elderwood Project, use zero-day exploits to gain initial access to systems through watering hole attacks. Watering hole attacks involve compromising a website or network that is frequently visited by individuals from a specific industry or sector, with the aim of infecting their devices. The use of zero-day exploits indicates a high level of sophistication, as these are previously unknown vulnerabilities for which no patch is available.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
   - **Initial Access**: Gaining initial access to systems via watering hole attacks that utilize zero-day exploits.
   - The question then inquires about the likelihood of establishing **Command and Control (C&C) servers** to maintain control over compromised systems and to retrieve commands from the attackers.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Establishing C&C servers** is a common TTP used by attackers after gaining initial access to a network. This allows them to issue commands, exfiltrate data, and maintain persistence within the compromised environment.
   - Given the sophistication of using zero-day exploits and the method of initial access, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would want to maintain control over the compromised systems to achieve their objectives, whether it be data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Sophistication of the Attack**: The use of zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks suggests a high level of sophistication and planning.
   - **Objective of Initial Access**: Gaining initial access is typically a precursor to further actions within a network, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or deployment of additional malware.
   - **Need for C&C**: To effectively achieve these post-compromise objectives, maintaining control and the ability to issue commands is crucial.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the context and the TTPs described, it is logical to conclude that establishing C&C servers would be a likely next step for the attackers to maintain control and achieve their objectives.

**Final Answer: A**
