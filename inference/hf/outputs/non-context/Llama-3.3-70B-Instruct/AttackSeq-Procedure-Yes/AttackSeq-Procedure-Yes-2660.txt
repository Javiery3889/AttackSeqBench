To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described action.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions Mustang Panda's Korplug variant performing data discovery. This implies an initial stage of reconnaissance or exploration of the target system, which aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Specifically, collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives falls under techniques like "File and Directory Discovery" (T1083) and possibly "Data from Local System File" (T1005).

2. **Data Exfiltration**: After the discovery phase, the question posits the use of a custom protocol for data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is a common objective of many cyber attacks, corresponding to the "Exfiltration" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Techniques under this tactic include "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" (T1048), which could involve using a custom protocol for transferring data out of the target network.

3. **Custom Protocol for Exfiltration**: The use of a custom protocol for data exfiltration, especially one that involves compressed and encrypted messages over TCP, is a sophisticated method to evade detection. This aligns with the technique of "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" and possibly "Encrypted Channel" (T1573), where an adversary might use encryption to hide the data being exfiltrated.

4. **Evaluation**: Given the context of Mustang Panda's Korplug variant being involved in targeted attacks and the mention of specific, sophisticated TTPs like data discovery and the use of a custom protocol for exfiltration, it is reasonable to infer that such an operation would indeed involve advanced methods for evading detection, including encryption and compression of exfiltrated data.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of a custom protocol for data exfiltration after performing data discovery. This suggests that the answer to whether Mustang Panda's Korplug variant is likely to use such a method for data exfiltration is affirmative.
