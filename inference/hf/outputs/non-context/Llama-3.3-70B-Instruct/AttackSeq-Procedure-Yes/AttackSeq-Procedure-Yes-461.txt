To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of such a sequence based on known behaviors of Hidden Cobra, a cyber threat group attributed to North Korea.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of TTPs:
   - **Targeting**: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations to gather victim identity information.
   - **Malicious Domain**: Leveraging a malicious domain resembling "Falcon Coin" to distribute "Bankshot" implants.
   - **Initial Access**: Using spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits for initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Hidden Cobra's Known TTPs**: Hidden Cobra is known for targeting financial institutions and using various TTPs to gain access and extract funds. They have been associated with the use of spear phishing, malware (including the Bankshot implant), and exploiting vulnerabilities in software (like Flash) to gain initial access to victim networks.
   - **Malicious Domains and Implants**: The use of malicious domains to distribute malware is a common TTP among threat actors, including Hidden Cobra. Bankshot is a known implant associated with Hidden Cobra, used for remote access and control.
   - **Spear Phishing and Exploits**: Spear phishing with embedded exploits (such as Flash exploits) is a tactic used by Hidden Cobra to gain initial access to targeted systems.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Hidden Cobra's interest in cryptocurrency and financial organizations aligns with their known objectives of financial gain.
   - **Step 2**: The use of a malicious domain to distribute Bankshot implants is consistent with their tactics of using malware for remote access.
   - **Step 3**: Employing spear phishing with embedded Flash exploits for initial access is a plausible next step, given their history of using social engineering and exploiting software vulnerabilities.

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the known behaviors and objectives of Hidden Cobra. Therefore, it is likely that after targeting cryptocurrency and financial organizations, Hidden Cobra would leverage a malicious domain resembling Falcon Coin to distribute Bankshot implants and use spear phishing emails with embedded Flash exploits for initial access.

**Final Answer: A**
