To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in malware campaigns, particularly those involving remote access trojans (RATs) like JhoneRAT.

1. **Initial Access via Malicious Microsoft Office Documents**: This is a common initial access vector. Attackers often use malicious documents, such as those exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office, to gain initial access to a system. The fact that these documents are hosted on Google Drive adds a layer of legitimacy and can help evade security controls that might block direct attachments or downloads from less reputable sources.

2. **Execution of a Macro to Download a Base64-Encoded Binary**: Macros in Microsoft Office documents can be used to execute malicious code upon opening the document, provided macros are enabled. Downloading a base64-encoded binary is a plausible next step, as this is a common method for delivering the next stage of malware while attempting to evade detection. Base64 encoding can make the binary less suspicious to security software.

3. **Achieving Persistence by Creating a 'ChromeUpdater' Entry in the Windows Registry**: Creating a registry entry to achieve persistence is a well-documented technique. Malware often masquerades as legitimate system components or applications to maintain access to a compromised system. Naming the entry 'ChromeUpdater' could be an attempt to blend in with legitimate Google Chrome update mechanisms, making it less likely to be detected by the user or basic security checks.

Given these points, the sequence described aligns with common TTPs used by malware campaigns:
- Initial access through social engineering and exploitation of user trust (malicious documents on Google Drive).
- Use of macros to download additional malicious components (base64-encoded binary).
- Attempting to blend in with legitimate system activities for persistence (posing as a Chrome updater).

Therefore, the sequence of events described is plausible and consistent with known tactics used by attackers.
