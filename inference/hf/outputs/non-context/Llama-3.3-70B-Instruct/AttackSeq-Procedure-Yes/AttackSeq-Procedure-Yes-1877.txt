To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyzing the Question**:
   - The question mentions the use of JSPRAT for local command execution and BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution. 
   - It then asks if FIN13 is likely to replace KeePass binaries with trojanized versions for persistence before using tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump for privilege escalation.

2. **Identifying TTPs**:
   - **Initial Access and Execution**: The use of JSPRAT and BLUEAGAVE suggests methods for gaining initial access and executing commands on a compromised system.
   - **Persistence**: Replacing KeePass binaries with trojanized versions is a method of achieving persistence, allowing the attackers to maintain access to the system.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Using tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump indicates an attempt to escalate privileges, which is a common step after initial access to gain more control over the system.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The sequence described (initial access/execution, potential persistence, and then privilege escalation) is a logical progression in a cyber attack.
   - FIN13 is known for sophisticated and targeted attacks, and replacing legitimate software with trojanized versions is a tactic used by various threat actors for persistence.
   - The use of Mimikatz and ProcDump for privilege escalation is consistent with attempts to gain higher levels of access within a compromised network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The initial use of JSPRAT and BLUEAGAVE for command execution suggests a targeted attack with a focus on establishing a foothold within the network.
   - **Step 2**: To maintain this foothold, replacing KeePass binaries with trojanized versions would provide a covert means of persistence, allowing FIN13 to regain access even if initial entry points are closed.
   - **Step 3**: Finally, using tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump for privilege escalation aligns with the goal of expanding control within the network, which typically follows establishing persistence.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the logical progression of the attack sequence and the tactics commonly employed by sophisticated threat actors like FIN13, it is plausible that FIN13 would replace KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to ensure persistence before attempting to escalate privileges.
