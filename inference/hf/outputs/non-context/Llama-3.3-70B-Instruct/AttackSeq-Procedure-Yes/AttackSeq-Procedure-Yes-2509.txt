To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate how they align with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Spearphishing**: The attack starts with spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments. This is a common initial access technique (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment) used by attackers to gain a foothold into a network. The goal here is to trick a user into opening the attachment, which could be a malicious document or executable file, thereby installing malware on the victim's system.

2. **Network Mapping and Password Collection**: After gaining initial access, the attackers aim to map the network and collect passwords. Network mapping can be associated with techniques like Network Service Scanning (T1046) and System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016), where attackers seek to understand the network topology and identify potential targets. Collecting passwords can involve techniques such as Credential Dumping (T1003), where attackers attempt to obtain account credentials from the system, or using tools like Mimikatz. The goal of collecting passwords is often to obtain domain administrator credentials, which would grant elevated privileges across the network.

3. **Obtaining Domain Administrator Privileges**: With collected credentials, especially those of a domain administrator, attackers can move laterally within the network with elevated privileges. This aligns with the Privilege Escalation (T1068) technique, where attackers aim to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network.

4. **Lateral Movement using Tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe**: Finally, the attackers use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement. PsExec, in particular, is a tool that can be used for executing processes on remote systems, which aligns with the Remote Services (T1021) and Windows Remote Management (T1028) techniques. WinExe, though less commonly referenced in the context of ATT&CK, could be considered in the context of executing commands or programs on remote systems.

Given this sequence:
- The attackers start by gaining initial access through spearphishing.
- They then work to understand the network and gather credentials to escalate privileges.
- Finally, they use those privileges and specific tools to move laterally across the network.

This sequence is a logical and common progression of tactics and techniques used by attackers to infiltrate, escalate, and laterally move within a network. Therefore, it is indeed likely that attackers, after gaining initial access, would map the network, collect passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges, and then use tools like SysInternals PsExec and similar utilities for lateral movement.
