To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned, comparing them with known behaviors and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Reconnaissance**: The question starts with the use of system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance. This is a common approach for attackers to gather information about the network and its topology. The initial access was gained through malicious documents with job offers, which is a social engineering tactic often used by various threat actors, including the Lazarus Group, to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on links.

2. **Network Share Discovery**: The use of `net user` and `SMBMap` for network share discovery is mentioned. `net user` is a command used to manage user accounts, which can be used to enumerate users on a system, while `SMBMap` is a tool used to enumerate samba shares. This step aligns with the tactics of discovering local and network shares, which is a common step after initial access to understand the network layout and identify potential targets for lateral movement.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The question mentions leveraging compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement. This is a common technique used by attackers to move across a network, exploiting the trust and permissions associated with legitimate accounts to avoid detection and gain access to sensitive areas of the network.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of using system utilities for reconnaissance, gaining access through malicious documents, using `net user` and `SMBMap` for network share discovery, and then leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement is plausible for the Lazarus Group.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely for the Lazarus Group.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The Lazarus Group is known for sophisticated attacks, including social engineering tactics to gain initial access.
2. The use of native system utilities for reconnaissance is a common and stealthy approach.
3. Network share discovery using tools like `net user` and `SMBMap` fits within the context of post-exploitation activities aimed at understanding the network.
4. Leveraging compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement is a known tactic used by advanced threat actors, including the Lazarus Group, to maintain access and evade detection.

**Conclusion**: Given the tactics described and the known behaviors of the Lazarus Group, the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question aligns with plausible actions of an advanced threat actor aiming to gain access, understand the network, and move laterally.

**Final Answer: A**
