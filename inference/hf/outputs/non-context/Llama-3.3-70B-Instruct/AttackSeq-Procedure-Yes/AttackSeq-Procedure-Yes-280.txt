To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Defense Evasion using image files**: The initial step involves using image files to hide malicious components. This is a common technique used by attackers to evade detection by security software. The use of seemingly innocuous files like images to conceal malware is a creative way to bypass traditional signature-based detection methods.

2. **Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer**: Process Hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is spawned in a suspended state, and its memory is then unmapped and replaced with malicious code. The legitimate process is then resumed, allowing the malicious code to run under the guise of a legitimate process. Using Internet Explorer for this purpose could be a tactic to blend in with normal system activity, as Internet Explorer is a commonly used application.

3. **Injecting a malicious payload**: This step involves inserting malicious code into the hollowed process. Given that the question mentions using image files for defense evasion and then process hollowing, it's plausible that the malicious payload would be injected into a process like Internet Explorer to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

4. **Employing AES encryption for C&C communication**: After establishing a foothold, using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption for communication with the Command and Control (C&C) server is a common practice. This encryption helps in evading network traffic detection, as the communication between the compromised host and the C&C server will be encrypted, making it harder for security systems to detect and intercept.

Given the sequence of TTPs described:
- The initial evasion technique using image files suggests a sophisticated approach to avoiding detection.
- The use of Process Hollowing within a common application like Internet Explorer is a plausible next step for executing malicious code while appearing legitimate.
- Finally, encrypting C&C communications with AES is a standard practice for hiding the exfiltration of data or receipt of further instructions from the C&C server.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of these TTPs and their alignment with known attack patterns, the sequence described in the question forms a coherent and plausible attack scenario.
