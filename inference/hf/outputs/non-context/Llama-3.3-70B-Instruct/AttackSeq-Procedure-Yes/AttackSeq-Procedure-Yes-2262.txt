To answer this question, let's break down the key components and analyze them in the context of the Cosmic Banker malware and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Execution of a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at the memory level**: This indicates an initial access technique where the attacker uses a script to execute malicious code directly in memory, which is a common method to evade detection. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter" and "T1204: User Execution" for the initial stages of an attack.

2. **Enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks**: This points to the "Persistence" tactic, where an attacker tries to maintain access to the system. Techniques like "T1186: Create Shortcut" and "T1050: Scheduled Task" are used to ensure the malware remains active on the victim's system even after restarts or other events that might otherwise terminate the malicious process.

3. **Targeting Mexican financial institution users to steal credentials**: This indicates a specific targeting strategy by the malware, focusing on users of financial institutions in Mexico. This is more related to the "Initial Access" and "Credential Access" tactics, where the attacker aims to gain initial access to the system and then collect sensitive information like credentials.

4. **Displaying text related to an alleged data update request before accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts**: This suggests a social engineering tactic to trick the user into divulging sensitive information or allowing the malware to access their email accounts. This can be associated with "T1566: Phishing" and "T1114: Email Collection" techniques.

Given these points, the Cosmic Banker malware's behavior as described aligns with known TTPs used by banking trojans and information stealers. The specific targeting of Mexican financial institution users and the methods used to trick them into divulging credentials or allowing access to their email information fit within the context of how such malware operates.

Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques described, it is plausible that the Cosmic Banker malware would engage in such activities to achieve its goals of stealing credentials and collecting sensitive information.
