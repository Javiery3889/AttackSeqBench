To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question mentions the Naikon APT group using the Aria-body backdoor for gathering system and network information during the Discovery tactic. It then asks if this group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control (C2) stage.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - **Discovery**: Using the Aria-body backdoor to gather detailed system and network information.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The potential use of HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a backdoor like Aria-body for discovery implies that the attackers have established a foothold within the target network and are looking to expand their access and control.
   - The Command and Control stage involves establishing a communication channel between the compromised host and the attacker's C2 server. This stage is crucial for executing further malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, and downloading additional malware.
   - HTTP and TCP are common protocols used for C2 communications due to their ubiquity and the ease with which they can blend in with normal network traffic, making them less likely to be detected by security monitoring tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The Naikon APT group has already demonstrated the ability to use sophisticated tools (like the Aria-body backdoor) for initial compromise and discovery.
   - **Step 2**: For the C2 stage, the attackers would logically choose protocols that are widely used and less likely to arouse suspicion, allowing them to maintain access without detection.
   - **Step 3**: Given the characteristics of HTTP and TCP, and their common use in C2 communications, it is reasonable to conclude that the Naikon APT group would use these protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands.

**Final Answer: A**
