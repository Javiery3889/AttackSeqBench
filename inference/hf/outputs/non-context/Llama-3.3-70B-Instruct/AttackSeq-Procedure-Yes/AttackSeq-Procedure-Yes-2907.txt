To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups like APT15, as well as the tools mentioned.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that APT15 gains initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials. This aligns with common initial access techniques such as Valid Accounts (T1078) and Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210), depending on how the VPN certificates are used.

2. **OS Credential Dumping**: The use of Mimikatz for OS credential dumping is a common technique (T1003) used by various threat actors, including APT groups. Mimikatz is a powerful tool that can extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN codes, and kerberos tickets from memory, making it a valuable asset for lateral movement and privilege escalation.

3. **Execution Evasion and Command Execution**: The deployment of tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution suggests the use of techniques such as Command and Scripting Interpreters (T1059) for execution, and possibly Application Window Discovery (T1010) or other discovery techniques, depending on the specific functionalities of these tools. RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS could be custom or known tools used for executing commands, evading detection, and possibly establishing persistence or exfiltrating data.

Given the context and the TTPs involved:
- **Initial Access** through compromised credentials and VPN certificates is a common entry point for APT groups.
- **Credential Dumping** with tools like Mimikatz is a logical next step to gain further access and escalate privileges within the network.
- **Execution and Evasion** using custom or known tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS aligns with the tactics of maintaining access, executing commands, and evading detection.

Therefore, considering the typical behavior of APT groups and the specific TTPs mentioned, it is plausible that APT15 would use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution.
