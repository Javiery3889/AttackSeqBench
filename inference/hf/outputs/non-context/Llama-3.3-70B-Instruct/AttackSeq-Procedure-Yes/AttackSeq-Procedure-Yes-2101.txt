To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) typically associated with such an attack scenario, keeping in mind the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where a backdoor, installed by attackers, is used to exfiltrate data over a Command and Control (C&C) channel using encrypted communication. The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied through the presence of a backdoor.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The backdoor is used for C2, facilitating encrypted communication.
   - **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated over the C&C channel.
   - **Impact**: The potential action of shutting down the victim's computer is considered as a means to disrupt operations and impact system availability.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests that after exfiltrating data, the attackers would likely shut down the victim's computer. While it's possible, shutting down the system after exfiltration might not always align with the attackers' goals, especially if they wish to maintain access for future operations or if the system's continued operation is necessary for their objectives.
   - **Option B (No)**: This option implies that shutting down the computer might not be a likely next step after exfiltration. This could be because the attackers might want to maintain access, avoid detection, or because their goals do not necessarily involve disrupting the system's availability at this stage.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Attackers typically install backdoors for persistent access and to facilitate various malicious activities, including data exfiltration.
   - The use of encrypted communication for C2 and exfiltration indicates a level of sophistication and an intent to avoid detection.
   - Shutting down the victim's computer could alert the victim to the attack, potentially leading to the backdoor being discovered and removed, which would counter the attackers' interest in maintaining access.
   - Disrupting system availability might be a goal in certain scenarios (e.g., ransomware attacks), but in the context of a backdoor and data exfiltration, the primary goals often revolve around stealthy, long-term access and data theft rather than immediate disruption.

5. **Final Answer**: Considering the typical goals of attackers who install backdoors and exfiltrate data, and the potential consequences of shutting down a victim's computer, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not necessarily include immediate system shutdown after data exfiltration. Thus, the answer that aligns best with the described attack sequence and the common objectives of such attacks is:

**Final Answer: B**
