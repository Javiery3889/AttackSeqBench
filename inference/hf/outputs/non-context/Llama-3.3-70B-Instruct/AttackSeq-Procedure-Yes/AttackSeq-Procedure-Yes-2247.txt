To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in determining the most plausible sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that an adversary like SideCopy might use, especially in the context of targeting a specific application like Kavach, which is a multi-factor authentication app.

1. **Understanding SideCopy**: SideCopy is a known adversary group that has been involved in various cyber attacks. Understanding their past TTPs is crucial. SideCopy has been associated with the use of malicious files and loaders to gain initial access to victim systems.

2. **Initial Access Techniques**: The question mentions the use of malicious LNK files, HTAs (HTML Applications), and loader DLLs. These are all known techniques for gaining initial access to systems. 
   - **LNK Files**: These can be used to execute malicious commands or launch malware when clicked.
   - **HTAs**: These can be used to execute malicious scripts.
   - **Loader DLLs**: These can load and execute malicious payloads.

3. **Delivery Mechanisms**: The delivery of these malicious files can be through various means such as phishing emails, drive-by downloads, or exploitation of vulnerabilities.

4. **Establishing Initial Access**: The use of these files and techniques aligns with establishing initial access (TA0001) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gaining an initial foothold within a network.

5. **Targeting MFA Apps**: Targeting a multi-factor authentication app like Kavach indicates a sophisticated attack, possibly aiming to bypass security controls. The use of malicious files and loaders could be a precursor to more targeted attacks, such as attempting to bypass MFA or steal authentication credentials.

Given these considerations:

- **SideCopy's known TTPs** involve using malicious files for initial access.
- **The techniques mentioned** (malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs) are plausible for establishing initial access.
- **The target** (a multi-factor authentication app) suggests a sophisticated attack, which could start with gaining initial access through such means.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Identify the adversary and their known TTPs: SideCopy has used malicious files and loaders.
2. Analyze the techniques mentioned: LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs are used for initial access.
3. Consider the target: An MFA app suggests a need for initial access to potentially bypass or exploit.
4. Evaluate the plausibility: Given SideCopy's history and the techniques mentioned, it's plausible they would use such methods for initial access.

**Final Answer: A**
