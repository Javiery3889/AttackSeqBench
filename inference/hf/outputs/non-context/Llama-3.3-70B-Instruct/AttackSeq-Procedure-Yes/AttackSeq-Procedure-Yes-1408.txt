To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario unfolding as described.

1. **Phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials**: This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where attackers use fake websites that mimic the real Instagram login page to trick users into entering their credentials. This aligns with the "Phishing" technique under the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Locking out original account owners**: After obtaining the credentials, attackers often change the account passwords and other security settings to lock out the original owners. This can be seen as part of the "Account Manipulation" or "Credential Access" tactics, where attackers modify account settings for their benefit.

3. **Demanding ransom payments**: The next step mentioned involves demanding ransom payments. This is a form of "Impact" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where the attacker's goal is to extort money from the victim. However, in the context of using stolen social media accounts, this step might not always directly follow the initial credential theft, as attackers might first aim to exploit the account for other benefits.

4. **Using stolen accounts to perpetuate further scams**: Finally, using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams is a common practice. Attackers leverage the trust and influence associated with these accounts to scam more people. This aligns with the "Social Engineering" or "Initial Access" tactics, where the compromised account is used as a vector for further malicious activities.

Given this sequence, the question is whether demanding ransom payments before using the accounts for further scams is a likely step. 

- **Ransom demands** are more commonly associated with attacks where data is encrypted (ransomware) or in cases of direct extortion based on the value of the compromised data or system access. In the context of social media accounts, the primary value to attackers often lies in using these accounts for spam, phishing, or spreading disinformation rather than holding them for ransom.

- **Using accounts for further scams** directly aligns with maximizing the financial gain from the compromised accounts without alerting the owners or authorities prematurely.

Considering these points, while it's possible for attackers to demand ransom, the primary motivation behind stealing and locking out accounts with significant followings is often to use them for malicious activities like phishing, spamming, or spreading disinformation, rather than demanding ransom.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Identify the primary goal of stealing social media credentials and locking out owners.
2. Evaluate the common practices following such actions.
3. Assess the likelihood of ransom demands in this specific context.

**Final Answer: B**
