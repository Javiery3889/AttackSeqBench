To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the backdoor communicating with the Command and Control (C&C) server via an encrypted channel.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already employed a backdoor function. This backdoor has been used for the Discovery and Collection tactics, which are part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Specifically, it has been used to collect machine information and take screenshots. The question then asks about the likelihood of the backdoor communicating with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence mentioned involves:
   - **Discovery**: Collecting machine information.
   - **Collection**: Taking screenshots.
   - **Command and Control**: The phase where the backdoor would communicate with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a backdoor for Discovery and Collection implies that the attacker is interested in gathering information about the target system and possibly maintaining access.
   - The Command and Control phase involves the attacker issuing commands to the compromised system. For this phase to be effective, especially in a post-exploitation scenario, maintaining stealth and ensuring the longevity of access is crucial.
   - Communicating via an encrypted channel would help in evading detection by network monitoring tools and intrusion detection systems, which is a common TTP used by attackers to maintain their access without being detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attacker has already shown an interest in stealthy operations by using a backdoor for information collection.
   - **Step 2**: The Command and Control phase requires reliable and preferably undetectable communication to issue commands and receive data.
   - **Step 3**: Using an encrypted channel for communication aligns with the goal of maintaining stealth and ensuring the command and control channel remains operational without detection.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of using a backdoor for stealthy information collection and the necessity of maintaining undetected communication for command and control, it is reasonable to conclude that the backdoor would likely communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel to avoid detection and ensure the longevity of access.
