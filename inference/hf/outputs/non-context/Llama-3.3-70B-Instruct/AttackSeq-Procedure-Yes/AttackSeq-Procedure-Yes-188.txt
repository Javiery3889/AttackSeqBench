To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Deploying tcpdump to scrape credential-containing files for Credential Access**: This action involves using a network traffic capture tool (tcpdump) to intercept and extract credentials from network traffic. This is a technique used for Credential Access, which is a tactic under the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Credential Access (TA0006) involves techniques used to obtain or create credentials that can be used to access systems, data, or services.

2. **Enumerate system data directories and GPS information to facilitate Discovery**: Discovery (TA0007) involves techniques used to gain knowledge about the system, network, or environment. Enumerating system data directories and collecting GPS information would fall under this category, as it helps an adversary understand the layout and specifics of the target environment, potentially identifying valuable data or systems to target.

3. **Automatically exfiltrating the collected files using Tor hidden services**: Exfiltration (TA0010) involves techniques used to transfer data from a system or network to an adversary-controlled system or location. Using Tor hidden services for exfiltration is a method to anonymously transfer data, making it difficult to trace back to the adversary.

Given the sequence of actions:
- The initial action is to gain credentials, which is a common first step in many attack sequences as it provides access.
- The next logical step after gaining access (through credentials) would be to understand the environment (Discovery), which includes enumerating system data directories and potentially collecting other relevant information like GPS data if the target systems are mobile or if such information is relevant to the adversary's goals.
- Finally, exfiltrating collected data (which could include the scraped credentials, system information, or other sensitive data) using a method like Tor hidden services for anonymity aligns with the goal of removing valuable data from the target environment without detection.

Considering these steps, the sequence described in the question forms a plausible attack sequence:
1. Gain access (Credential Access).
2. Understand the environment (Discovery).
3. Exfiltrate valuable data (Exfiltration).

Therefore, given the logical progression from accessing a system, to understanding its layout and content, to removing sensitive information, the answer to whether Infamous Chisel is likely to follow this sequence after deploying tcpdump is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
