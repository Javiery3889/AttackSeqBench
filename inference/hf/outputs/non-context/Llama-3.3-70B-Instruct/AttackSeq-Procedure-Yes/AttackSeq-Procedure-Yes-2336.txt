To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate its plausibility based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document. This document has an auto-open VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro. This is a common initial access vector (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment), where the attacker uses social engineering to trick a user into opening the malicious document, thereby executing the macro.

2. **Execution**: The VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe'. Mshta.exe is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications (HTAs). It's often used by attackers for executing malicious scripts because it can bypass some security controls (T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution). This step is plausible as it's a known technique used by attackers to execute commands without directly invoking more commonly monitored executables like powershell.exe or cmd.exe.

3. **Download and Execution**: The 'mshta.exe' is used to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL. This involves using 'mshta.exe' to execute an HTA that downloads additional malware. This is a common technique (T1204 - User Execution) where the initial malware (in this case, the VBA macro) downloads and executes a second stage, often to establish a more persistent presence or to download the actual payload.

4. **Persistence**: The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours. This ensures that even if the initial malware is removed or the system is restarted, the malware can reinfect the system or maintain its presence (T1050 - Scheduled Task).

Given these steps, the sequence described is entirely plausible and aligns with known attack patterns:
- Initial access via phishing and malicious documents.
- Use of legitimate utilities (like mshta.exe) for execution and evasion.
- Downloading additional payloads from external sources.
- Establishing persistence through scheduled tasks.

This sequence leverages social engineering, exploits user trust in common applications, and uses evasion techniques to maintain access, all of which are common in real-world attacks.
