To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate how likely it is that the group, Blind Eagle, would follow this sequence based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via JavaScript Downloader**: The use of a JavaScript downloader hosted on a content delivery network (CDN) like Discord's for initial access is plausible. Threat actors often exploit publicly available services for malicious purposes, including hosting malware or loaders. This method can help in evading detection and provides a degree of anonymity.

2. **Utilizing PowerShell to Load DLLs and Perform AMSI Bypass**: PowerShell is a powerful tool that attackers frequently use for various purposes, including loading malicious DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) and bypassing the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI). AMSI bypass techniques are commonly used by attackers to evade detection by endpoint security solutions. This step aligns with known TTPs used by various threat groups to maintain stealth and ensure the execution of their malicious payloads.

3. **Achieving Persistence via VBScript in the Startup Folder**: Placing a script or executable in a startup folder is a classic method for achieving persistence on a compromised system. The use of a VBScript to execute a batch file upon system startup is a viable approach for ensuring that malicious activities are restarted after a system reboot. This method aligns with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques related to startup folder execution.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question aligns well with known TTPs used by threat actors, including Blind Eagle. The use of JavaScript for initial access, leveraging PowerShell for further exploitation and evasion, and achieving persistence through startup folder execution are all tactics that have been observed in various cyber attacks.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The initial access method is plausible and aligns with modern threat actor TTPs.
- The use of PowerShell for loading DLLs and AMSI bypass is a common technique used for evasion and exploitation.
- Achieving persistence through a VBScript in the startup folder is a known method for ensuring continued access to a compromised system.

**Final Answer**: A
