To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes an initial phase of an attack where the adversary, Earth Lusca, uses tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan for scanning open ports and shared folders. This activity is categorized under the discovery phase, which is part of the attack lifecycle where an attacker gathers information about the target environment. The question then asks if, after this phase, Earth Lusca is likely to engage in protocol tunneling during the command and control (C2) phase to communicate with compromised systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - **Discovery**: Scanning for open ports and shared folders.
   - **Potential C2**: Establishing communication with compromised systems, possibly through protocol tunneling.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Discovery Phase**: The use of tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan indicates an effort to identify vulnerabilities or open paths into a network. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, aimed at gathering information that can be used to plan further actions.
   - **Command and Control Phase**: After identifying potential entry points, an attacker would need to establish a means of communicating with compromised systems to issue commands or exfiltrate data. Protocol tunneling is a technique that can be used to bypass network defenses by encapsulating C2 communications within protocols that are typically allowed through firewalls or other security controls.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The discovery phase activities suggest that Earth Lusca is gathering information to plan a potential intrusion.
   - The identification of open ports and shared folders could provide multiple avenues for initial access.
   - Establishing a reliable C2 channel is crucial for any further exploitation or data exfiltration.
   - Protocol tunneling is a plausible method for maintaining stealthy C2 communications, especially if the network has strict egress filtering or monitoring in place.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of the discovery phase activities and the need for a stealthy and reliable method of communicating with compromised systems, it is reasonable to conclude that Earth Lusca might engage in protocol tunneling as part of the C2 phase.
