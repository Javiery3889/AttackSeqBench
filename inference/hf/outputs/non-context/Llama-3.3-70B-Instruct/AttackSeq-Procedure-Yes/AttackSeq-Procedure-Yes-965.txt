To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described communication method being used by the Naikon APT group.

1. **Understanding the Components**:
   - **Aria-body backdoor**: This is a type of malware used for gaining unauthorized access to a victim's machine. Backdoors are known for their ability to collect information and receive commands from a command and control (C&C) server.
   - **Naikon APT group**: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are sophisticated threat actors known for their targeted attacks. They often use customized malware and tools tailored to their objectives.
   - **HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are common protocols used for communication over the internet. HTTP is often used for web traffic, while TCP is a transport-layer protocol ensuring reliable data transfer.

2. **Analyzing the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The sequence starts with the Aria-body backdoor collecting detailed information from the victim's machine. This action aligns with the initial stages of an APT attack, where reconnaissance and information gathering are key.
   - The next step involves using HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication. Given that APT groups often blend their communications with normal network traffic to avoid detection, using standard protocols like HTTP and TCP is plausible. These protocols can help disguise malicious traffic as legitimate web browsing or other common network activities.

3. **Evaluating the Likelihood**:
   - APT groups, including Naikon, are known for their sophisticated tactics. Using common protocols for C&C communication is a tactic that aligns with their goals of remaining stealthy and avoiding detection.
   - Executing additional commands received from the server is consistent with the behavior of backdoors, which are designed to provide remote access and control to attackers.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the information and the typical behaviors of APT groups, it is reasonable to conclude that the Naikon APT group could use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication after the Aria-body backdoor has collected information from the victim's machine. This method would allow them to blend in with normal network traffic, reducing the likelihood of detection.
