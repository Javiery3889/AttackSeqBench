To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, as well as the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Exploitation of Vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119):** The attackers gained initial access by exploiting a known vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player. This is a common entry point for many attacks, as exploiting vulnerabilities can provide an easy way into a system, especially if patches are not up to date.

2. **Use of Dropper Executable (Rdws.exe) for DLL Sideloading:** After gaining initial access, the attackers might use a dropper to introduce additional malware into the system. A dropper is a type of malware designed to install or "drop" other malicious components. DLL sideloading is a technique where a legitimate executable is tricked into loading a malicious DLL, allowing the attackers to execute malicious code under the guise of a legitimate process. This is a plausible next step as it allows the attackers to expand their foothold within the system while attempting to remain stealthy.

3. **Evading Defenses by Deploying a Malicious DLL alongside a Legitimate Program Executable:** This step involves using the technique of DLL sideloading to evade defenses. By loading a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate executable, the attackers can blend their malicious activity with normal system operations, making it harder for security software to detect the malicious activity.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that after gaining initial access, using a dropper for DLL sideloading and then evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL with a legitimate program is a likely sequence of events. This aligns with common TTPs where attackers seek to expand their access, maintain stealth, and evade detection.

- **B: No** - This choice implies that the described sequence of events is unlikely. However, based on the tactics and techniques commonly used by attackers, there's no inherent reason to believe this sequence is implausible without additional context suggesting otherwise.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The initial exploitation of a known vulnerability is a common attack vector.
2. The use of a dropper for DLL sideloading is a tactic that aligns with attempting to establish a foothold in the system while evading detection.
3. Deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable to evade defenses is consistent with known evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: A**
