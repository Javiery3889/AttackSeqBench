To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions attributed to Charming Kitten, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group. The actions include creating fake websites to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase. It then asks if, during the Reconnaissance phase, it is likely that they targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned involve:
   - **Resource Development**: Creating fake websites to obtain credentials. This is a common TTP used by threat actors to gather resources, such as credentials, that can be used in further phases of an attack.
   - **Reconnaissance**: Targeting non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists. Reconnaissance involves gathering information about potential targets, which can include identifying individuals who might have access to desired information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This option suggests that after obtaining credentials through fake websites, Charming Kitten would likely engage in targeted reconnaissance by impersonating well-known figures to gather more specific information about their targets. This is a plausible next step, as having obtained initial access or credentials, the next logical step would be to use social engineering tactics to gather more targeted information or to move laterally within a network.
   - **Option B (No)**: This option suggests that the actions described in the Reconnaissance phase are not likely to follow the initial credential gathering. However, given the context of APT groups like Charming Kitten, who are known for sophisticated and targeted operations, it's less likely that they would not use such tactics for reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Charming Kitten's initial action of creating fake websites to obtain credentials indicates a level of sophistication and intent to gather specific resources.
   - The use of social engineering, such as impersonating well-known researchers or journalists, is a common TTP in the Reconnaissance phase, especially for APT groups aiming to gather targeted information.
   - Given the group's known activities and the logical progression of attack phases, it is reasonable to conclude that they would engage in targeted reconnaissance after obtaining initial resources.

**Final Answer: A**
