To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence of actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes an app that collects sensitive information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) from an iOS device and performs certain routines. After collecting this data, it is suggested that the app sends the gathered information via HTTP and then uploads files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - **Data Collection**: Gathering text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - **Data Exfiltration**: Sending the gathered information via HTTP.
   - **File Upload**: Uploading files via FTP protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Data Collection** is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where an adversary collects valuable data from a compromised device or system. This aligns with the "Collection" technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Data Exfiltration via HTTP**: Using HTTP for data exfiltration is plausible as it is a common protocol used for communication over the internet, and adversaries often use existing protocols to blend in with normal network traffic. This could align with techniques under "Exfiltration" in the ATT&CK framework.
   - **File Upload via FTP**: FTP is a protocol used for transferring files over the internet. While it's less common for C2 communications due to its lack of encryption and security features compared to other protocols, it could still be used by an adversary for uploading files, especially if the goal is to use existing infrastructure or tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial collection of sensitive data is a typical first step in many attacks, aimed at gathering intelligence or valuable information.
   - The use of HTTP for sending gathered information is reasonable, given its widespread use and the potential for blending in with normal traffic.
   - The subsequent use of FTP for uploading files, while less common for C2 due to security concerns, could still be part of an adversary's toolkit, especially if the focus is on simplicity or leveraging existing protocols and infrastructure.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the steps outlined and the commonality of using existing protocols for C2 operations, the described sequence of sending gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP as part of C2 operations is plausible. Therefore, the answer to whether it is likely for the app to engage in this sequence of actions is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
