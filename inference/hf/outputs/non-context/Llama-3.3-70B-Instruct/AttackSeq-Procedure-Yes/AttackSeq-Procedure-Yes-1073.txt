To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the proposed next step.

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers gain initial access through watering hole tactics, exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782). This is a common approach for gaining initial access to a network, as it leverages vulnerabilities in software that the target is likely using, increasing the chances of a successful exploit.

2. **Execution**: After gaining access, custom shellcode is executed to download and run a PowerShell loader. This step indicates that the attackers are using the initial access to establish a foothold within the system, with the PowerShell loader likely being used as a mechanism to execute further malicious code or tools.

3. **Proposed Next Step - Privilege Escalation**: The question posits that the attackers will use the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation. This step aligns with common post-exploitation TTPs, where attackers seek to increase their privileges to gain more control over the compromised system. Executing backdoors with system privileges would allow attackers to perform actions that require higher levels of access, such as accessing sensitive data, installing additional malware, or moving laterally within the network.

Given the sequence of events:
- The attackers have already demonstrated the ability to exploit vulnerabilities and execute custom code.
- The use of a PowerShell loader is a flexible and powerful tool for executing further malicious code, including backdoors.
- The logical next step after establishing a foothold and executing a loader would be to escalate privileges to achieve more significant control over the system.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access through exploitation is a common first step.
2. Executing a PowerShell loader provides a versatile mechanism for further exploitation.
3. Privilege escalation is a typical next step to increase control and access within the compromised system.

**Conclusion**: Given the context and the typical progression of a cyber attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the attackers would indeed use the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation.
