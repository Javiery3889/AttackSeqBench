To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) like APT10, in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access and Reconnaissance**: APT10, like many APT groups, often begins with initial access techniques such as spearphishing, exploiting remote services, or using valid accounts to gain access to a network. Once inside, they conduct internal reconnaissance to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and gather information about the systems and data available. This step aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which includes techniques like Network Service Discovery (T1046) and System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016).

2. **Identifying Systems of Interest**: After mapping out the network, APT10 would likely identify systems of interest. This could involve looking for servers containing sensitive data, systems with access to desired information, or machines that can be used as a pivot point for further lateral movement within the network. This action falls under the "Discovery" tactic as well, specifically under the technique of System Information Discovery (T1082).

3. **Remote Command Execution**: To interact with these systems of interest, APT10 might use remote command execution scripts. This allows them to execute commands on remote systems without direct physical access, enabling further exploitation and data staging. Remote command execution is associated with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the technique of Remote Services (T1021) or Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059).

4. **Data Staging with Compression Tools**: Finally, using compression tools to stage data in multi-part archives is a common technique for preparing exfiltrated data. This makes the data more manageable for transfer and can help evade detection by making the data less conspicuous. Data staging is part of the "Collection" and "Exfiltration" tactics, with techniques like Data Staging (T1074) and Archive Collected Data (T1560).

Given these steps and the typical TTPs of APT10, it is reasonable to conclude that after conducting internal reconnaissance, APT10 would indeed identify systems of interest and use remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives. This sequence of actions aligns with known APT10 behaviors and the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
