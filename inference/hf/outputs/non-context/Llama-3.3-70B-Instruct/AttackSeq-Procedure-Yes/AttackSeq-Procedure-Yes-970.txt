To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs attributed to the Naikon APT group. The steps include:
   - Evading defenses by operating Command and Control (C&C) servers in limited time windows.
   - Utilizing fileless loading techniques.
   - Using the Aria-body backdoor.
   - Gathering information about active processes during the discovery phase.
   - Utilizing HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Evading defenses** and **utilizing fileless loading techniques** are initial steps that suggest an attempt to remain stealthy and avoid detection. This aligns with advanced persistent threat (APT) group tactics, which often involve sophisticated evasion techniques.
   - The use of the **Aria-body backdoor** implies a method for maintaining access to a compromised system. Backdoors are typically used after initial access has been gained to allow for continued access without being detected.
   - **Gathering information about active processes** is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack, where attackers seek to understand the environment they are operating in. This can help in identifying potential targets, understanding system defenses, and planning further actions.
   - **Utilizing HTTP and TCP protocols** for C&C communication is a common technique, as these protocols are widely used and can help disguise malicious traffic as legitimate.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial steps of evading defenses and using fileless loading techniques suggest a sophisticated attack aimed at avoiding detection.
   - The deployment of a backdoor (Aria-body) after these initial steps is plausible as it would provide a means for persistent access.
   - The action of gathering information about active processes aligns with the objectives of a discovery phase, where understanding the target environment is crucial.
   - Finally, using standard protocols like HTTP and TCP for C&C communication is consistent with trying to blend in with normal network traffic.

Given this analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence. The use of the Aria-body backdoor for gathering information during the discovery phase, followed by communication with the C&C server via HTTP and TCP protocols, aligns with the tactics one would expect from an APT group like Naikon.

**Final Answer: A**
