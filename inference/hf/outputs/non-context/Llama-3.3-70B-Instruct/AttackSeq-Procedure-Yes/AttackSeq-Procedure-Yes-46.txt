To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.

1. **Initial Access via Phishing Emails**: The campaign starts with phishing emails, which is a common initial access vector (T1193) according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Phishing emails are often used to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on links that lead to malicious websites.

2. **Malicious Attachment ('Richard_Johnson.doc')**: The phishing emails contain a malicious Microsoft Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. This document likely contains macros that are designed to execute malicious code when the document is opened and macros are enabled.

3. **Execution of VBS Macros**: The question mentions the execution of VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document. This aligns with the technique of "Office Application Startup" (T1137) and specifically "VBA Macros" if we consider the broader category, though VBS is slightly different, it's conceptually similar in terms of executing scripts upon opening a document.

Given these points, the sequence described is plausible and aligns with known TTPs used by attackers:
- **Initial Access** is gained through phishing emails.
- The malicious document attachment is a common payload for phishing emails.
- The execution of macros (in this case, VBS macros) upon opening the document is a known technique for executing malicious code on a victim's system.

Therefore, considering the common attack vectors and techniques used by adversaries, it is likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails could execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access.
