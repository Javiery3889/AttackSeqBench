To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the SombRAT backdoor exfiltrating data over the C2 channel as described.

1. **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers**: The CostaRicto Campaign uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish communication with Command and Control (C2) servers. This is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection, as it disguises malicious traffic as legitimate.

2. **Use of SSL-Encrypted Traffic and RSA-Secured AES Key Exchanges**: The use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption for C2 communication adds a layer of security, making it harder for defenders to intercept and understand the content of the communication. Additionally, using RSA-secured AES key exchanges for encrypting the C2 communication ensures that the encryption keys are securely exchanged, further protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data being communicated.

3. **Exfiltration of Data**: Given that the attackers have established a secure and stealthy communication channel with their C2 servers, it is logical that they would use this channel for data exfiltration. The SombRAT backdoor, being a tool capable of remote access and control, would likely be used for this purpose.

4. **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after establishing secure communication, the SombRAT backdoor would indeed exfiltrate data over the C2 channel. Given the context, this is a plausible next step in the attack sequence. The attackers have invested in establishing a secure and covert communication channel, which would be useful for exfiltrating sensitive data without detection.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that despite the establishment of a secure C2 channel, the SombRAT backdoor would not be used for data exfiltration. Given the capabilities of SombRAT and the effort to establish a secure communication channel, this seems less likely.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attackers establish a secure and stealthy communication channel.
2. They use advanced encryption methods to protect this channel.
3. The SombRAT backdoor is capable of remote access and control, which includes data exfiltration.
4. The established secure channel would be an ideal means for exfiltrating data without detection.

**Final Answer**: A
