To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on typical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with malware operations, particularly those attributed to Gamaredon.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a scenario where malware, attributed to Gamaredon, has been deployed. This malware is capable of searching for sensitive documents and taking screenshots during the collection phase of an attack. The question then inquires about the likelihood of these harvested documents being automatically uploaded to a Command and Control (C&C) server during the exfiltration phase.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
   - Deployment of malware.
   - Collection of sensitive documents and screenshots.
   - Potential exfiltration of the collected data to a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Collection Phase**: The collection of sensitive documents and screenshots is a common TTP used by various threat actors to gather valuable information from compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration Phase**: The exfiltration of collected data to a C&C server is a typical next step for attackers, as it allows them to access and utilize the stolen information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware's capability to search for and collect sensitive documents and take screenshots indicates a design focused on gathering specific types of data, suggesting an intent to exfiltrate this data for further use.
   - **Step 2**: The exfiltration of data to a C&C server is a standard method for attackers to retrieve stolen information, allowing them to analyze it, use it for malicious purposes, or sell it.
   - **Step 3**: Given that the malware is designed to collect specific data, it is logical to assume that it would also be designed to exfiltrate this data back to the attackers, enabling them to achieve their objectives.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical TTPs associated with malware operations and the specific capabilities of the malware described, it is reasonable to conclude that the modules would indeed be designed to automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase, as this aligns with the logical progression of an attack aimed at stealing sensitive information.
