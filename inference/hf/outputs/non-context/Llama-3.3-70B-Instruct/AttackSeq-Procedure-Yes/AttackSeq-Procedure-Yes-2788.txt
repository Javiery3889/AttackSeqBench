To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the XAgent app as described:

1. **Execution and Evasion**: The XAgent app executes itself in the background on iOS 7 devices. This indicates the app has found a way to bypass or exploit iOS's usual restrictions on background execution, possibly through a jailbreak or an exploit. It hides its icon, which is a tactic to remain stealthy and avoid detection by the user. The app also restarts when terminated, suggesting it has implemented a persistence mechanism, a common tactic used by malware to ensure continued presence on a compromised device.

2. **Data Collection (Discovery Routine)**: The question mentions the app's potential to collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine. Collecting geo-location data is a common practice among spyware and surveillance malware, as it provides valuable information about the target's movements and location, which can be useful for various malicious purposes, including targeted attacks or espionage.

3. **Data Exfiltration**: The app is described as sending the collected data out via HTTP to its Command and Control (C&C) server. This is a typical method used by malware to exfiltrate data from a compromised device back to the attackers, where it can be analyzed and used for further malicious activities.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after executing and establishing persistence on the device, the XAgent app would indeed collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine and then send this data to its C&C server via HTTP. This sequence aligns with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in malware and spyware campaigns, where collecting sensitive information such as location data is a high priority for attackers.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the XAgent app would not collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine and send it to its C&C server. Given the app's behavior of executing in the background, hiding its icon, and restarting when terminated, it seems unlikely that it would not engage in data collection activities, as these evasion techniques are typically used to facilitate such malicious data collection and exfiltration.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The XAgent app's ability to execute in the background and maintain persistence suggests it is designed for stealthy, long-term operation on the device.
2. Hiding its icon and restarting when terminated are tactics used to avoid detection and ensure continued operation, which are common in spyware and malware.
3. Collecting geo-location data is a plausible next step for an app that has already demonstrated capabilities for evasion and persistence, as this data is valuable for espionage or targeted attacks.
4. Sending collected data via HTTP to a C&C server is a standard method for exfiltrating data from compromised devices.

**Final Answer: A**
