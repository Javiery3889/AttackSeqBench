To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.

1. **Initial Access via Phishing**: The question mentions the exploitation of CVE-2018-0798 through a malicious RTF (Rich Text Format) document. This vulnerability is related to Microsoft Office and can be exploited by convincing a user to open a specially crafted RTF file. The fact that the document appears to be sent by the Cabinet of Cambodia and contains a list of government officials suggests a targeted phishing attempt. This is a common TTP where attackers use social engineering to trick victims into opening malicious files or clicking on links, thereby gaining initial access to the victim's system.

2. **Use of Social Engineering**: The document's content, appearing to be from a legitimate source (the Cabinet of Cambodia) and containing relevant information (a list of government officials), is designed to increase the likelihood that the target will open the document. This is a classic example of social engineering, where the attacker uses psychological manipulation to achieve their goals.

3. **Post-Exploitation Activities**: After gaining initial access, the attackers use a file named 'OSEA54d.tmp' to drop additional malicious files into system directories. This step is consistent with common post-exploitation TTPs, where attackers seek to establish a foothold, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network. Dropping additional malicious files can be part of establishing persistence, executing further malicious actions, or preparing for data exfiltration.

Given these points, the sequence described aligns well with known attack patterns:
- **Initial Access** is achieved through phishing, exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-0798) via a malicious document.
- **Social Engineering** is used to increase the success rate of the phishing attempt by making the document appear legitimate and relevant to the target.
- **Post-Exploitation** involves dropping additional malicious files, which is a common step in establishing persistence and preparing for further malicious activities.

Therefore, considering the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) outlined, the sequence of events described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns.
