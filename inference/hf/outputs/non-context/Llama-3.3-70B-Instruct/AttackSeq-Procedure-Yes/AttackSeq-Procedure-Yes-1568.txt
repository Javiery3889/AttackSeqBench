To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the situation based on the information provided and general knowledge of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving Turla, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, using a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) backdoor during the discovery phase. This backdoor has file upload and download capabilities. The question asks if, after this initial phase, Turla would likely use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase.

2. **Identify Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) here involves:
   - **Initial Access** and **Discovery**: Turla uses an RPC backdoor for file upload and download, indicating they have gained access to the system and are likely mapping out the environment.
   - **Collection**: The next phase involves collecting data. The question specifies collecting recent files and files from USB drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Turla's Modus Operandi (MO)**: Turla is known for sophisticated and targeted attacks, often using customized malware and backdoors to achieve their objectives. Their operations typically involve extensive reconnaissance and data collection to meet their intelligence gathering goals.
   - **Backdoor Capabilities**: The use of backdoor plugins for collecting specific data (recent files and files from USB drives) aligns with the capabilities of sophisticated backdoors used by APT groups. These plugins can be tailored to collect specific types of data, indicating a targeted approach to data collection.
   - **Collection Phase Objectives**: During the collection phase, the primary objective is to gather relevant data. Collecting recent files and files from USB drives could provide valuable intelligence, including documents, encryption keys, or other sensitive information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Turla's use of an RPC backdoor with file upload and download capabilities during the discovery phase indicates a high level of access and control over the compromised system.
   - The collection of recent files and files from USB drives would be a logical next step to gather sensitive information, which aligns with the objectives of a targeted cyber espionage campaign.
   - Given Turla's sophistication and the capabilities of their backdoors, it is reasonable to conclude that they would utilize such methods for data collection.

**Final Answer: A**
