To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the Stager module notifying of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

1. **Initial Access and Privilege Escalation**: The attack begins with the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows. This is followed by the use of CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 for privilege escalation. This phase is about gaining sufficient access and privileges to proceed with the attack.

2. **Stager Module's Role**: In a typical attack sequence, a Stager module is used after initial access has been gained. Its primary function is to prepare the environment for the main payload by setting up a connection to the command and control (C2) server, checking for and possibly killing security software, and then downloading additional malware components necessary for the attack.

3. **Notification of Successful Exploitation**: The question of whether the Stager module would notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module depends on the attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, in many cases, the Stager's primary role is to silently set up the environment for further exploitation, which includes downloading additional malware. Notification of successful exploitation at this stage could potentially alert defenders and is not typically a primary function of the Stager module itself but rather of the C2 communication protocol or separate beaconing mechanisms.

4. **Downloading and Executing a Malware Dropper Module**: The Dropper module's role is to introduce the main malware payload into the compromised system. This step is crucial for the attackers to achieve their objectives, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or establishing persistence.

Given these considerations, the most plausible sequence aligns with typical attack patterns where the Stager module focuses on setting up the environment and downloading necessary components without explicitly notifying of its actions to avoid detection. The notification of successful exploitation is more likely to occur through other means, such as beaconing back to the C2 server, which is a separate mechanism from the Stager's primary function.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The attack sequence starts with exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access and privilege escalation.
- The Stager module's primary role is to prepare the environment, which includes downloading additional malware components.
- Notification of successful exploitation is not typically the Stager's primary function; instead, it focuses on setting up for further exploitation.
- The Dropper module is then downloaded and executed to introduce the main malware payload.

**Final Answer: B**
