To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like Lazarus.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions initial access gained through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This is a common TTP for many threat actors, including Lazarus. Spear-phishing is a technique (T1566.001) under the Initial Access tactic, where attackers send targeted emails to specific individuals, often with malicious attachments.

2. **Execution**: The scenario describes achieving execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory. This implies the use of defense evasion techniques, possibly including the use of in-memory only payloads to avoid detection. ThreatNeedle is known to be used by Lazarus, and running malware in memory (T1027, T1204) is a technique used to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Discovery**: The question mentions system network connections discovery under the Discovery tactic. After gaining initial access and executing malware, it's logical for an attacker to conduct discovery activities to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and plan further actions. System network connections discovery (T1049) is a technique used to gather information about the network, which aligns with post-compromise exploration activities.

Given these points, the sequence described aligns well with known TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors like Lazarus:
- **Initial Access** via spear-phishing with a malicious document is plausible.
- **Execution** of a backdoor like ThreatNeedle in memory for persistence and evasion is consistent with advanced threat actor behavior.
- **Discovery** activities following initial access and execution are logical steps in the attack sequence to facilitate further malicious actions.

Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques mentioned, it is likely that Lazarus could have followed this sequence of TTPs.
