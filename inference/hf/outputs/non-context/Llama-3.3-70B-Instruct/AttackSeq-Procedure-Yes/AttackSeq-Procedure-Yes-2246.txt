To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions a specific sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) associated with a threat actor or malware known as SideCopy. The activities include:
   - Deploying modular plugins for:
     - File enumeration
     - Browser password stealing
     - Keylogging
   - These activities are mentioned during the "collection phase," which implies a stage of gathering information or data from the target system.
   - The question then asks if SideCopy is likely to target Kavach (which could refer to a specific security software or system) and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the "credential access tactic."

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial TTPs involve data collection and reconnaissance (file enumeration, browser password stealing, keylogging).
   - The subsequent action involves targeting a specific system (Kavach) for credential access, using specific tools (GoLang-based file recon plugins) for exfiltrating authentication databases.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **SideCopy's Modus Operandi (MO)**: If SideCopy is known for using modular plugins for various malicious activities, including data collection and credential theft, it's plausible they would continue this pattern to achieve specific goals, such as accessing Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Targeting Kavach**: The question implies SideCopy has an interest in Kavach, possibly due to its security relevance or the value of the data it protects. Targeting security software or systems is a common tactic to gain elevated access or to disable security measures.
   - **Use of GoLang-based file recon plugins**: The use of specific tools (in this case, GoLang-based plugins) for file reconnaissance and exfiltration aligns with the modular and adaptable nature of SideCopy's operations as described.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: SideCopy uses modular plugins for various malicious activities, indicating a flexible and adaptable approach to achieving their goals.
   - **Step 2**: The activities mentioned (file enumeration, password stealing, keylogging) are consistent with preparatory phases of an attack, setting the stage for more targeted actions like credential access.
   - **Step 3**: Targeting Kavach and using specific tools for exfiltration fits the pattern of exploiting gathered information to access valuable data, in this case, authentication databases.
   - **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the described TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that SideCopy would indeed target Kavach and use specified tools to exfiltrate authentication databases as part of their credential access tactic.

**Final Answer: A**
