To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical cyber attack and relate them to the information provided in the question.

1. **Understanding the Attack Vector**: The question mentions the exploitation of a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) via spear phishing emails. This is a common initial access technique where attackers use social engineering to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or links, which then exploit a vulnerability to gain access to the victim's system.

2. **Preparation for the Attack**: Before executing the attack, adversaries typically prepare by setting up infrastructure and tools necessary for the attack. This can include registering domains that might be used for command and control (C2) communications or for hosting malicious payloads. The mention of acquiring domains like "wordkeyvpload[.]net" suggests preparation for potential C2 channels or for hosting malicious files.

3. **Use of Tools**: The mention of "Empire" refers to a post-exploitation framework that allows attackers to manage and control compromised hosts. Acquiring or setting up such tools is a common step in preparing for an attack, as it enables the attackers to maintain access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within a network once initial access is gained.

4. **Logical Sequence of Events**: Given the complexity of setting up a successful phishing campaign and the need for infrastructure to support post-exploitation activities, it is logical that adversaries would prepare their tools and infrastructure before launching the initial attack. This preparation would include acquiring necessary domains and tools like Empire to facilitate the attack's success and to maintain access to compromised systems.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical sequence of events in a cyber attack and the specific details provided in the question, it is reasonable to conclude that the adversaries would have prepared their infrastructure and tools before executing the spear phishing campaign. This preparation would have included acquiring domains and tools necessary for the attack.
