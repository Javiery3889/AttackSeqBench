To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of FIN13's actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks.

1. **Obtaining Credentials**: The initial step involves obtaining credentials, which is a common precursor to deeper network exploitation. Techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) and using trojanized KeePass binaries are sophisticated methods to gain access to sensitive authentication information. This step aligns with the initial phases of an attack, where attackers seek to gain a foothold and elevate their privileges.

2. **Gathering Information on Services**: After obtaining credentials, the next logical step for an attacker would be to gather information about the network and its services. System service discovery is a technique used to identify services running on a system or network. This information is crucial for planning the next stages of the attack, including identifying potential vulnerabilities, understanding network architecture, and planning lateral movement. This step is consistent with the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the "Discovery" tactic, which includes techniques for discovering local system and network services.

3. **Lateral Movement Using WMI and Custom Web Shells**: Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network to expand access and control. Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and custom web shells are recognized techniques for lateral movement. WMI allows for remote management and can be exploited for executing commands on remote systems, while custom web shells provide a covert channel for issuing commands and maintaining access. These methods are advanced and indicate a sophisticated attacker who has already gained significant access and is looking to further exploit the network.

Given the sequence of actions described:
- Obtaining credentials through sophisticated means.
- The necessity of gathering information on services to inform lateral movement strategies.
- The use of advanced techniques for lateral movement.

It is logical to conclude that after obtaining credentials, FIN13 would indeed gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally in the network. This sequence aligns with the typical progression of a sophisticated cyber attack aimed at network exploitation and persistence.
