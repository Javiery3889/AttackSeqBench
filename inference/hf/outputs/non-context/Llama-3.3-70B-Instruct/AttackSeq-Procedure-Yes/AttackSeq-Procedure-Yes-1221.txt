To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the plausibility of the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Collection Phase**: The attackers are compressing proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR. This action is a common technique used by attackers to gather and package data in a compact form, making it easier to handle and exfiltrate. The use of WinRAR for compression is a plausible step in the collection phase as it is a widely available and user-friendly tool.

2. **Exfiltration Phase**: The question outlines two main actions in this phase:
   - **Using custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox**: Attackers often use custom malware to evade detection by traditional security software. Utilizing custom malware for exfiltration is a common TTP, as it allows attackers to bypass security controls and move data out of the target network without being detected. Exfiltrating data to cloud services like Dropbox is also a known technique, as it provides a convenient and relatively anonymous way to store and retrieve stolen data.
   - **Employing cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files**: cURL is a command-line tool used for transferring data to and from a web server using various protocols, including HTTP and FTP. It's a versatile tool that can be used for uploading files to cloud storage services like Dropbox. Attackers might use cURL as part of their custom malware or as a standalone tool to upload exfiltrated files, especially if they are looking for a lightweight and flexible method to interact with web services.

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with known attack patterns:
- Compressing data for easier exfiltration is a common technique.
- Using custom malware for exfiltration is a prevalent method to avoid detection.
- Utilizing cloud services like Dropbox for storing exfiltrated data is a known tactic.
- Employing tools like cURL for uploading files to these services is plausible, given its capabilities and flexibility.

Therefore, considering the tactics and techniques outlined, it is indeed likely that attackers would use such a sequence of TTPs during an attack.
