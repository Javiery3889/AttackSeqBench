To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the Milum Trojan uses HKCU autorun system registry keys (Run and RunOnce) for persistence. This is a technique used by malware to maintain its presence on a compromised system even after restarts. The question then asks if it's likely that the Milum Trojan would use JSON configuration data and transmit command and control (C2) communications via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - **Persistence**: Using HKCU autorun system registry keys for persistence.
   - **Configuration**: Possibly using JSON configuration data.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: Possibly transmitting C2 communications via HTTP POST requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The initial step of using autorun registry keys for persistence is a common malware technique. Malware often seeks to survive system restarts to maintain access to the compromised system.
   - The use of JSON configuration data is plausible as many modern applications and malware use JSON for configuration due to its simplicity and ease of parsing.
   - Transmitting C2 communications via HTTP POST requests is also a common technique. Malware often uses standard HTTP protocols to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware achieves persistence, which is a fundamental step for any malware seeking to have a lasting impact on a compromised system.
   - **Step 2**: The use of JSON for configuration is consistent with modern software development practices, including those potentially used by malware authors for simplicity and flexibility.
   - **Step 3**: Using HTTP POST requests for C2 communications is a tactic that allows the malware to communicate with its command and control servers in a way that might evade detection, as it blends in with normal web traffic.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the techniques described, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing persistence, the Milum Trojan could indeed use JSON configuration data and transmit C2 communications via HTTP POST requests as part of its operation. This aligns with common practices observed in malware operations, where the goal is often to maintain stealth, flexibility, and reliability in communication with command and control servers.
