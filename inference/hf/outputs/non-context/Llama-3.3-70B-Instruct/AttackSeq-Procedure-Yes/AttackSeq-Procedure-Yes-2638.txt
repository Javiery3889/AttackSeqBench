To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malware.

1. **Data Collection**: The malware, Machete, has already collected data through various means such as stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes. This step is typical for malware aiming to gather sensitive information from the compromised system.

2. **Communication with Command and Control (C2) Servers**: For the malware to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate the collected data, it needs to communicate with its C2 servers. Using FTP and HTTP ports for this communication is plausible because:
   - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Often used for transferring files over the internet, FTP could be utilized by malware to upload stolen data to the C2 servers or to download additional malicious components.
   - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Commonly used for web traffic, HTTP can be used by malware to blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect. Malware can use HTTP to communicate with C2 servers, sending stolen data or receiving commands.

3. **Data Exfiltration**: After collecting data, the next logical step for the malware would be to exfiltrate this data to remote servers controlled by the attackers. Encrypting the data before exfiltration is a common practice to protect it from being intercepted and read by security systems or third parties.

Given these points, the scenario described in the question aligns with common TTPs used by malware:

- **Data collection** through various methods.
- **Communication with C2 servers** using common protocols like FTP and HTTP to blend in with normal traffic or to utilize existing network protocols for file transfer.
- **Data exfiltration** with encryption to protect the data and the communication channel.

Therefore, considering the steps involved and the typical behavior of malware, it is likely that the malware used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers before exfiltrating encrypted data to remote servers.
