To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the events unfolding as stated.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of events in a cyber attack. Initially, malicious JavaScript code is inserted into a Korean-language news portal. This insertion is aimed at redirecting victims to an exploit landing page. The exploit landing page is designed to exploit CVE-2019-13720, a vulnerability in Google Chrome. After successful exploitation, the attackers use heap spraying techniques to achieve an arbitrary read/write primitive, which allows them to execute an embedded shellcode payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**:
   - **Initial Access**: Malicious JavaScript code is inserted into a website (a Korean-language news portal) to redirect users to an exploit landing page. This can be considered a form of "Drive-by Compromise" (T1189) or "Spearphishing Link" (T1192), depending on how the redirection is achieved.
   - **Exploitation**: The exploit landing page targets CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, aiming to exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the victim's system. This aligns with "Exploitation for Client Execution" (T1203).
   - **Privilege Escalation/Execution**: Heap spraying is used to achieve an arbitrary read/write primitive, facilitating the execution of embedded shellcode. This can be related to "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation" (T1068) and "Execution" techniques such as "Shared Modules" (T1129) or more directly "Exploitation for Client Execution" (T1203) depending on the context.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - The sequence described starts with a social engineering vector (malicious JavaScript redirecting to an exploit page) followed by exploitation of a specific vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) and then uses heap spraying for further exploitation. This sequence is plausible as it combines social engineering with technical exploits to gain access and escalate privileges on a victim's system.
   - The use of heap spraying after exploiting a browser vulnerability is a known technique to bypass memory protections and execute malicious code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers insert malicious JavaScript into a news portal, which is a common initial access technique to redirect victims to malicious sites.
   - **Step 2**: The redirection to an exploit landing page that targets a known vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome is a plausible next step for exploiting client applications.
   - **Step 3**: After successful exploitation, using heap spraying to achieve an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute shellcode is a technically feasible and known method for attackers to further compromise a system.

5. **Final Evaluation**: Given the technical feasibility and the alignment with known attack patterns, the sequence described in the question is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
