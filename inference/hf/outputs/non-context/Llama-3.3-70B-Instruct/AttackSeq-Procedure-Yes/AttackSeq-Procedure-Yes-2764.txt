To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the Dragonfly group, and then evaluate the likelihood of the described sequence.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question mentions the Dragonfly attackers creating user accounts for stealthy operations within victim networks. This action implies that the attackers have already gained initial access to the network. The question asks if it's likely that before creating these user accounts, the attackers performed reconnaissance using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Reconnaissance (using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits)
   - Creating user accounts for stealthy operations

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Reconnaissance** is a preliminary step in many cyber attack sequences. It involves gathering information about the potential victim. Techniques like spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits are common methods used for initial access (TA0001 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework) and reconnaissance.
   - **Creating user accounts** falls under the "Credential Access" (TA0006) or "Persistence" (TA0003) tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, indicating that the attackers have already gained access to the system and are looking to maintain that access or escalate privileges.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The Dragonfly group, known for their sophisticated attacks, would likely follow a structured approach to compromise their targets.
   - Reconnaissance is a critical initial step for understanding the target's network, identifying vulnerabilities, and planning the attack.
   - The methods mentioned (spear-phishing, watering holes, supply-chain exploits) are all viable for initial access and align with known TTPs of sophisticated threat actors.
   - Creating user accounts for stealthy operations implies the attackers have moved past the initial access phase and are now focused on persistence and potentially lateral movement or privilege escalation.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the typical attack sequence and the TTPs associated with sophisticated threat actors like Dragonfly, it is logical to conclude that before creating user accounts for stealthy operations, the attackers would have performed some form of reconnaissance to gain initial access and understand the victim's network.
