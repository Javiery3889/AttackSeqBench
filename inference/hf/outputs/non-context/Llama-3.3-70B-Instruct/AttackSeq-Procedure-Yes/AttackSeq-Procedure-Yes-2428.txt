To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the plausibility of the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Defense Evasion**: The attacker (ATMitch) starts by using defense evasion techniques. This is a common initial step in many attacks, where the attacker tries to avoid detection by disguising the payload. This could involve code obfuscation, anti-debugging techniques, or making the payload appear as a legitimate system resource.

2. **Custom Loader and Injection**: The use of a custom loader to inject a payload into a target process is a technique often used by attackers to execute malicious code within the context of a legitimate process. This can help the malicious activity blend in with normal system operations, making it harder to detect.

3. **Targeting 'fwmain32.exe' for Process Discovery**: Process discovery is a technique used by attackers to gain an understanding of the processes running on a system. Targeting 'fwmain32.exe' specifically might seem unusual without more context, as this process is not typically highlighted in common attack scenarios. However, if 'fwmain32.exe' is a process that is always running on the target system and has the necessary permissions or access that the attacker needs, it could be a plausible target for process discovery or even for hiding malicious activity within a legitimate process.

4. **Reading Commands from a File in 'c:\intel' for Command and Control (C2)**: Using a file as a means for command and control is an unconventional approach compared to more common methods like network communication. However, it's not unheard of, especially in scenarios where network traffic is heavily monitored, and the attacker wants to avoid detection. The 'c:\intel' folder could be a designated drop zone for commands, allowing the attacker to issue commands to the compromised system without arousing suspicion through unusual network activity.

Given these points, let's evaluate the plausibility of the sequence:

- The initial steps of defense evasion and custom loader injection are common and well-documented TTPs used by attackers.
- The specificity of targeting 'fwmain32.exe' might raise some questions without additional context, but it's not implausible if the process serves a purpose for the attacker's goals.
- The use of a file for C2 operations, while less common, could be a tactic used to avoid detection in a highly monitored environment.

Considering these factors, the sequence described, although somewhat specific and unconventional in parts, does not inherently contradict known attack patterns or the MITRE ATT&CK framework's described TTPs. Therefore, without additional context suggesting otherwise, it's reasonable to consider that such a sequence could occur.
