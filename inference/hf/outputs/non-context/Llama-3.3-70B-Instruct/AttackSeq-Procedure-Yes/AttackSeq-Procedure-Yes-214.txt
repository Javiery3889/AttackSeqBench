To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where Elirks malware retrieves its command and control (C2) server address. The method of retrieval involves accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites. The attackers first create accounts on these platforms and then post encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence involves:
   - **Initial Access**: Not directly mentioned but implies the malware (Elirks) has already been deployed on the target system.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The malware retrieves the C2 server address.
   - **Technique for C2 Server Address Retrieval**: Utilizing social networking sites or microblog services to host encoded C2 server addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Plausibility**: It is a known TTP for attackers to use social media, microblogging, or other online platforms to host or communicate C2 server information. This method can provide a layer of anonymity and make it harder for defenders to detect and block the C2 communication.
   - **Prevalence**: There have been instances where malware has used such platforms for C2 communications, making this approach plausible.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The attackers create accounts on social networking or microblogging sites. This is a common and easy step for attackers, as creating such accounts is typically straightforward and can be done with minimal traceability.
   - **Step 2**: The attackers post encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers on these platforms. This step is also plausible as it allows for a dynamic way to update C2 server addresses without directly exposing them in the malware code.
   - **Step 3**: The Elirks malware accesses these platforms to retrieve the C2 server addresses. This step is technically feasible, as malware can be programmed to access web content, decode the posted information, and use it to establish C2 communications.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the steps outlined and the known TTPs used by attackers, it is indeed likely that Elirks malware could retrieve its C2 server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites where attackers have posted encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A**
