To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the actions taken by Russian-speaking cybercriminals during the execution phase.

1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with the cybercriminals gaining initial access through spear-phishing or phishing mass-mailing campaigns. This is a common tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP) used by various threat actors, including Russian-speaking groups, to infiltrate target networks. The use of malicious attachments or links is aimed at tricking users into executing malware that establishes a foothold in the target environment.

2. **Execution Phase**: After gaining initial access, the next steps typically involve establishing persistence, escalating privileges, and moving laterally within the network. Downloading programs for remote administration tools (RATs) is a plausible action during this phase. RATs can provide the attackers with the ability to remotely control compromised systems, which is useful for further exploiting the network, stealing data, or using the compromised systems as a launchpad for other attacks.

3. **Compromising Administrators' Credentials**: The use of RATs can indeed facilitate the compromise of system administrators' credentials. By gaining control over a system, attackers can install keyloggers, screen scrapers, or use other methods to capture login credentials, including those of administrators. This action aligns with the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under techniques related to credential access and privilege escalation.

Given these considerations, the sequence of TTPs described in the question—gaining initial access through phishing, followed by downloading RATs to compromise administrators' credentials—forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence. This pattern is consistent with known behaviors of sophisticated threat actors, including Russian-speaking cybercriminal groups, who often aim to maximize their access and control within a compromised network.
