To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Discovery**: The malware performs discovery, which includes detecting newly inserted devices, producing file listings for exfiltration, and gathering browser data. This step aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gathering information about the target system or network.

2. **Data Collection**: After discovery, the question asks if it's likely for the malware to utilize screen capture as part of data collection. Screen capture is a technique under the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, used to capture screenshots of the victim's desktop or applications. Given that the malware is already engaged in gathering sensitive information (file listings and browser data), it's plausible that it would also use screen capture to collect more data, especially if the attackers are interested in visual information or data that might not be stored in files or browser history.

3. **Command and Control (C2) Communication**: The question mentions leveraging FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C2 servers. This aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers use various protocols to communicate with compromised systems to issue commands or receive stolen data.

Given the sequence of TTPs:
- The malware starts with discovery and data gathering (file listings, browser data).
- It is reasonable to assume that after gathering initial data, the malware would continue with more invasive data collection methods, such as screen capture, to maximize the information gathered.
- Finally, using FTP and HTTP ports for C2 communication is a common method for exfiltrating the collected data back to the attackers' servers.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of a cyber attack (from initial discovery, through data collection, to exfiltration and C2 communication), it is plausible that the malware would utilize screen capture as part of its data collection efforts before communicating with its C2 servers.
