To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the plausibility of Vyveva's backdoor performing these actions in the given order.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question outlines a specific sequence of actions that Vyveva's backdoor is suspected to perform. These actions include:
   - Obtaining system information (e.g., local IP address, system time) through discovery.
   - Collecting files from newly inserted removable media.
   - Notifying the Command and Control (C&C) server about the collected files.
   - Compressing the collected files.
   - Sending the compressed files to the C&C server.

2. **Comparison and Evaluation**: 
   - **Obtaining System Information**: This is a common initial step for many malware types, including backdoors, to understand the environment they are operating in.
   - **Collecting Files from Removable Media**: This action aligns with the interests of an attacker seeking to exfiltrate sensitive data. Removable media can be a source of valuable information.
   - **Notifying the C&C**: Before exfiltrating data, notifying the C&C server could be a way for the backdoor to receive further instructions or to confirm the value of the data found.
   - **Compressing and Sending Files**: Compressing files reduces the size, making them easier to transmit, and sending them to the C&C server is a logical step for data exfiltration.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question seems plausible for a backdoor designed for data exfiltration and communication with a C&C server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The backdoor gathers initial system information, which is a common reconnaissance technique.
   - **Step 2**: It then collects files from removable media, which could contain sensitive information.
   - **Step 3**: Notifying the C&C about these files could be a mechanism to filter or prioritize data exfiltration based on the attacker's current interests or needs.
   - **Step 4 & 5**: Compressing and sending the files to the C&C server completes the data exfiltration process, making it a logical conclusion to the sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
