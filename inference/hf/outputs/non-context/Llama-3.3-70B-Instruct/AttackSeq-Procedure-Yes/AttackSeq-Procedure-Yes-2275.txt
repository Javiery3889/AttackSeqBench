To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the Regin malware, which is known for its sophisticated and modular architecture. It mentions the use of Command-and-Control (C&C) capabilities with specific modules (C375h and 1Bh) for managing communications and compromised systems. The question then asks if Regin is likely to use its file and directory discovery feature to scan for deleted files as part of gathering operational intelligence for collection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied in the question involves:
   - Establishing C&C communications (using modules like C375h and 1Bh).
   - Gathering operational intelligence.
   - Using file and directory discovery capabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - **Establishing C&C** is a foundational step for most sophisticated malware, allowing the attackers to issue commands and receive data from compromised systems.
   - **Gathering operational intelligence** is a common goal of such malware, which often involves discovering the layout and content of the compromised system's file system.
   - **File and directory discovery** is a technique that aligns with gathering operational intelligence, as it helps in identifying potential targets for exfiltration or areas of interest within the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Regin's modular design and the mention of specific modules for C&C suggest a high degree of customization and control over the malware's actions.
   - The goal of gathering operational intelligence typically includes understanding what data is available on the system, which could extend to identifying deleted files that might still be recoverable or of interest.
   - Scanning for deleted files can be part of a thorough intelligence gathering process, especially if the attackers are looking for specific types of data that might have been deleted in an attempt to hide or secure them.

5. **Conclusion**: Given Regin's sophistication and the context of gathering operational intelligence, it is plausible that the malware would leverage its capabilities to scan for deleted files as part of its collection efforts. This action aligns with the goal of comprehensive intelligence gathering and the known capabilities of sophisticated malware like Regin.
