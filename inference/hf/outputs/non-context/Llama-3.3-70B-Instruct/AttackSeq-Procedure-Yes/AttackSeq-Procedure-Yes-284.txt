To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the Dropping Elephant threat actor using the described tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions the use of spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gain initial access. These are both valid TTPs under the "Initial Access" category in the MITRE ATT&CK framework (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment and T1189 - Drive-by Compromise for watering hole attacks, respectively). This step is plausible as both methods are commonly used by threat actors to initially compromise a network.

2. **Execution and Persistence**: The use of UPX-packed backdoor malware suggests the threat actor is attempting to maintain access and possibly execute further malicious code. UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) is a packer that can be used to compress and obscure malware, making it harder to detect. This aligns with techniques under "Execution" and "Persistence" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, such as T1204 - User Execution or T1050 - New Service, depending on how the malware is executed and maintained on the system.

3. **Defense Evasion and Command and Control**: Downloading additional malicious artifacts and evading detection by decoding encoded blobs are tactics that fit within the "Defense Evasion" and "Command and Control" categories of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Techniques like T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information and T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer could apply here, as the threat actor is attempting to hide their activities and bring in more tools to further their objectives.

Given the sequence of TTPs described:
- **Initial Access** through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks,
- **Execution** and possibly **Persistence** through the use of UPX-packed backdoor malware,
- **Defense Evasion** by decoding encoded blobs to avoid detection, and
- Further actions that could involve **Command and Control** and additional **Execution** of malicious code,

it is reasonable to conclude that the described sequence of actions is a plausible attack sequence for a sophisticated threat actor like Dropping Elephant. The use of packed malware, downloading additional tools, and evading detection are all common tactics used by threat actors to achieve their objectives within a compromised network.
