To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on known behaviors of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups like SideWinder.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where the callCam app has already collected extensive information from compromised devices. This implies an initial stage of reconnaissance or data collection, which is a common first step in many cyber attacks. The question then asks if it's likely that the SideWinder APT group would encode Command and Control (C&C) server addresses in Base64 and use the server to download exploits and additional payloads.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence here involves:
   - Initial compromise and data collection (using the callCam app).
   - Encoding C&C server addresses in Base64.
   - Using the C&C server to download additional exploits and payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Initial Compromise and Data Collection**: This is a common initial step for many APT groups, including SideWinder, to gather intelligence on the target environment.
   - **Encoding C&C Server Addresses in Base64**: Encoding C&C addresses is a technique used to evade detection by making the communication between the compromised device and the C&C server less suspicious. Base64 encoding is a simple, yet effective method for this purpose.
   - **Downloading Exploits and Additional Payloads**: After establishing a foothold, APT groups often use the C&C channel to download tools and payloads tailored to the specific target environment, aiming to achieve their objectives, such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial collection of device and application data suggests the attackers are gathering intelligence, which is consistent with the preparatory phases of an attack.
   - Encoding C&C server addresses in Base64 to evade detection is a plausible next step, as APT groups seek to maintain access without being detected.
   - Using the C&C server to download exploits and additional payloads aligns with the typical post-compromise actions of APT groups, aiming to expand their control and achieve their objectives within the compromised network.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the typical behaviors of APT groups like SideWinder, it is reasonable to conclude that after the initial compromise and data collection, the group would likely take steps to maintain stealthy communication with the compromised device and use this communication channel to further their objectives within the target network.
