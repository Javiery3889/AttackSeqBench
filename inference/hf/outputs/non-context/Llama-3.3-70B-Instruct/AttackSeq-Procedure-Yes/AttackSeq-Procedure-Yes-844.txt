To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the actions attributed to WinDealer based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks.

1. **Data Collection**: The initial step involves collecting data from specific directories, such as SNS application folders and other targeted directories. This action aligns with the technique of "Data Collection" (T1005) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary collects data of interest to achieve their goals.

2. **Data Processing**: The collected data is then processed into ".a" files stored in categorized directories. This step can be associated with "Data Staging" (T1074), where an adversary stages data in a centralized location, making it easier to exfiltrate.

3. **Data Staging and Encryption**: The question posits that after processing, WinDealer might stage the data in the %TEMP% directory and encrypt it. Staging data in a temporary directory like %TEMP% is a common practice (part of T1074) as it's a transient location that can be used to prepare data for exfiltration. Encrypting the data (T1022 - "Data Encrypted") before exfiltration is also a common TTP to protect the data from detection and interception.

4. **Data Exfiltration**: Finally, the encrypted data is exfiltrated to a Command and Control (C2) server using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556. This aligns with "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol" (T1048) and specifically using non-standard ports for C2 communication, which is a known technique to evade detection.

Given these steps and comparing them with known TTPs:

- **Data Collection** and **Data Processing** are initial steps that align with common adversary behaviors.
- **Data Staging in %TEMP%** and **Encryption** are plausible next steps to prepare the data for exfiltration without detection.
- **Exfiltration over specified ports** is consistent with using alternative protocols for C2 communication.

Considering these points, the sequence of actions described in the question follows a logical and commonly observed pattern in cyber attacks. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that WinDealer could indeed stage the data in the %TEMP% directory, encrypt it, and then exfiltrate it to a C2 server using the specified communication channels.
