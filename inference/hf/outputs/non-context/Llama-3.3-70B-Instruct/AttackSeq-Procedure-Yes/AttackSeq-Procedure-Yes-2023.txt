To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the behavior of Seaduke as described:

1. **Analysis of Seaduke's Behavior**:
   - Seaduke is used to retrieve detailed bot/system information. This action suggests that the malware is designed to gather intelligence on the compromised system, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This aligns with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "System Information Discovery" (T1018) or "System Network Configuration Discovery" (T1016).
   - The malware then securely deletes itself using a 'seppuku' function. This self-deletion mechanism, named after the Japanese term for ritual suicide, indicates that the malware is designed to cover its tracks and evade detection, which is a technique often used by sophisticated threats to maintain stealth.

2. **Communication with C&C Server**:
   - The question then asks if, after these actions, Seaduke is likely to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server and remain under the attackers' control via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption. This communication would fall under the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Application Layer Protocol" (T1071) for using HTTP/HTTPS, and potentially "Encrypted Channel" (T1573) or "Standard Encryption" (T1559) for the encryption aspect.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Given that Seaduke has already demonstrated the capability to gather system information and then delete itself, it suggests a level of sophistication that would likely include the ability to communicate with a C&C server for further instructions or to exfiltrate gathered data. The use of HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption would be a plausible method for such communication, as it leverages common internet protocols that are less likely to be blocked by network defenses, while also protecting the communication content from interception.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the described behavior of Seaduke and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in sophisticated malware campaigns, it is reasonable to conclude that Seaduke would indeed communicate with its C&C server and remain under the attackers' control, utilizing secure communication methods like HTTP/HTTPS with encoding and encryption.
