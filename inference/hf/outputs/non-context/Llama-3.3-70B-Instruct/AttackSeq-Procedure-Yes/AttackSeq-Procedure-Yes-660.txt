To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of using IP addresses as part of the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure before archiving data for exfiltration.

1. **Initial Access via DDE Exploitation**: The attack begins with exploiting the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol in Office documents. This is a known technique used by attackers to gain initial access to a system. This step aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Spearphishing Attachment" or "Exploit Public-Facing Application" techniques, depending on the exact vector used.

2. **Execution of Obfuscated PowerShell Payloads**: After gaining access, the attackers execute obfuscated PowerShell payloads. This is consistent with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique. Obfuscation is a common technique used to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Use of IP Addresses for C2**: The question then asks about the likelihood of using IP addresses as part of the command-and-control infrastructure. In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this relates to the "Command and Control" tactic. Using IP addresses directly for C2 communications is a common approach, although it can be easily detected and blocked. However, attackers often use more sophisticated methods, such as domain name systems (DNS) tunneling or leveraging compromised websites, to hide their C2 channels. Despite this, using IP addresses is still a plausible and straightforward method, especially if the attackers are confident in their ability to rotate or mask these addresses.

4. **Archiving Data with WinZip for Exfiltration**: Finally, the question mentions archiving data with the WinZip console for exfiltration. This aligns with the "Collection" and "Exfiltration" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Compressing data with tools like WinZip can make it easier to exfiltrate, especially if the attackers plan to transfer the data over a network or via removable media.

Given these steps, the question essentially asks if it's likely that an attacker, after gaining access and executing payloads, would use IP addresses for C2 before exfiltrating data. 

- **Step 1 & 2** are about initial access and execution, which are standard attack procedures.
- **Step 3** involves C2 communication, where using IP addresses, though detectable, is a simple and direct method.
- **Step 4** is about data exfiltration, which often follows successful C2 establishment.

Considering these points, using IP addresses for C2 communications before exfiltrating data is a plausible step in an attack sequence, especially if the attackers are looking for simplicity and speed over stealth. Therefore, the answer to whether it is likely that Gallmaker would use IP addresses as part of their C2 infrastructure before potentially archiving data for exfiltration with the WinZip console is affirmative.
