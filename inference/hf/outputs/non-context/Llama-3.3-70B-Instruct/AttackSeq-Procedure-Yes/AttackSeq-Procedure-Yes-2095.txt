To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate its plausibility based on known attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing with Malicious DOCX Documents**: This is a common initial access vector (T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment) where attackers send emails with malicious attachments. The use of DOCX documents that exploit the remote template technique is a known method to deliver malware, aligning with the technique of exploiting Microsoft Office macros or other vulnerabilities to execute malicious code.

2. **Exploiting Equation Editor Vulnerabilities using RoyalRoad**: The Equation Editor vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) is a well-documented exploit that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. RoyalRoad is a tool associated with exploiting this vulnerability, among others, to deliver malware. This step aligns with the technique of exploiting public-facing applications (T1190) or exploiting vulnerabilities in software (T1200), depending on the context.

3. **Initiating a Multi-Stage Infection Chain**: This is a common approach used by attackers to establish a foothold, deliver additional payloads, and achieve their objectives. It involves multiple steps and techniques, including executing malicious code, establishing command and control (C2) channels, and potentially moving laterally within a network.

4. **Creating a Scheduled Task named 'Windows Update' for Persistence**: Creating a scheduled task (T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job) is a technique used by attackers to maintain persistence on a compromised system. Naming it 'Windows Update' is a social engineering tactic to disguise the task as legitimate system maintenance, reducing the likelihood of detection.

Given these steps, the sequence described is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns:
- **Initial Access** is achieved through spear-phishing.
- **Execution** of malicious code is facilitated through exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Persistence** is maintained through scheduled tasks.
- **Defense Evasion** and **Command and Control** are implied through the use of exploits and potential C2 communication, though not explicitly mentioned.

This sequence leverages multiple techniques across different tactics as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, making it a realistic and coherent attack sequence.
