To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions following one another in a logical and technically plausible manner, considering the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved.

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The question starts with the execution of malicious payloads through DESLoader using DLL side-loading and fileless implants. DLL side-loading is a technique where a malicious DLL is loaded by a legitimate application, allowing the attacker to execute malicious code. Fileless implants refer to malware that resides in memory only and does not write any files to disk, making it harder to detect. This initial step indicates a sophisticated attack aimed at evading detection.

2. **Persistence**: After gaining initial access, establishing persistence is a common next step for attackers. This involves creating mechanisms to maintain access to the compromised system even after restarts or other events that might otherwise terminate their access. Registering scheduled tasks that mimic legitimate Windows tasks is a known technique for achieving persistence (T1050 - Scheduled Task/Job). This method allows attackers to blend in with normal system activity, making their malicious tasks less likely to be detected.

3. **Internal Network Scanning**: Following persistence, performing internal network scanning to identify potential targets for further exploitation is a logical next step. This involves searching for open ports such as RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and SMB (Server Message Block) ports, which can be used for lateral movement and credential access (T1046 - Network Service Scanning, T1110 - Brute Force). Identifying these open ports can help attackers in planning their next moves, such as attempting to gain access to additional systems or escalating privileges.

Given these considerations:

- The initial use of sophisticated techniques like DLL side-loading and fileless implants suggests a capable and stealthy adversary.
- Establishing persistence through scheduled tasks is a common and effective method that aligns with the initial sophisticated approach.
- Scanning the internal network for open RDP and SMB ports is a logical step for an attacker looking to expand their foothold and gain further access.

Therefore, the sequence of actions described in the question forms a coherent and technically plausible attack sequence. The use of scheduled tasks for persistence followed by internal network scanning for open ports like RDP and SMB aligns with known TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors, such as those attributed to APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups.
