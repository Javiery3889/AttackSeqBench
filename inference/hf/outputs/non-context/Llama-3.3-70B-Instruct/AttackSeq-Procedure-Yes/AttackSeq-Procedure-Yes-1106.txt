To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names for execution**: This technique is commonly used by attackers to trick users into executing malware. It aligns with the "Masquerading" technique under the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically "Masquerade as a Trusted Entity" (T1194) or "Obfuscated Files or Information" (T1027).

2. **Leveraging untrusted and faked digital signatures for defense evasion**: This involves using fake or untrusted digital certificates to make malware appear legitimate. This technique is also part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic, specifically "Subvert Trust Controls" (T1543) or "Code Signing" (T1553) if the context involves code signing certificates.

3. **Utilizing command-and-control (C2) infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services**: This involves using dynamic DNS services to manage the IP addresses of command and control servers, making it easier to change them if one is discovered and blocked. This aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically "Application Layer Protocol" (T1071) and "Dynamic DNS" (T1568).

Given these TTPs, the sequence described in the question represents a plausible attack sequence:
- **Initial Access** could be achieved through social engineering by tricking a user into executing the disguised malware.
- **Defense Evasion** techniques are used to avoid detection, including masquerading as legitimate files and potentially using fake digital signatures.
- **Command and Control** is established using dynamic DNS services to manage the C2 infrastructure, allowing for resilience against takedown efforts.

Considering the logical progression of an attack and the common use of these techniques together, it is reasonable to conclude that after disguising malware for initial execution, attackers might indeed use various defense evasion techniques (like leveraging untrusted digital signatures) before establishing a command and control channel that utilizes dynamic DNS services for resilience.
