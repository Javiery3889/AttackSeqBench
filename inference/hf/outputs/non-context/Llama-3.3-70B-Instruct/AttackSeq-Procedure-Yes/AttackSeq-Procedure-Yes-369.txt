To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Credential Dumping**: The attackers have already performed credential dumping, which is a technique used to obtain account credentials from a system. The use of a PowerShell script speculated to be related to Mimikatz, a tool known for extracting plaintext passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets from memory, indicates an attempt to gain access to sensitive authentication material. This aligns with the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Reading Memory of lsass.exe**: The lsass.exe process is a critical system process that handles authentication, among other tasks. Reading its memory is a common method to extract credentials, further supporting the notion that the attackers are focused on gaining access to sensitive authentication information.

3. **System Fingerprinting and Domain Trust Discovery**: After obtaining credentials, the next logical steps for an attacker would involve understanding the network layout and identifying potential targets for lateral movement or further exploitation. System fingerprinting helps in identifying the operating system, hardware, and software configurations of target systems, which can be useful for planning subsequent attacks. Domain trust discovery, using tools like nltest.exe (which can be used to query the trust relationships between domains) and ping.exe (for basic network discovery), would allow attackers to map the domain structure and identify potential vulnerabilities or entry points for further exploitation.

Given these steps, the sequence of TTPs described in the question follows a logical progression of an attack:

- **Initial Access** and **Credential Access** are achieved through credential dumping and reading the lsass.exe memory.
- **Discovery** would be the next phase, where system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery fit perfectly. These actions help attackers understand the environment, identify potential targets, and plan for **Lateral Movement** or **Privilege Escalation**.

Therefore, considering the logical progression of an attack and the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is indeed likely that after obtaining credentials, attackers would conduct system fingerprinting and proceed with domain trust discovery to further their goals within the compromised network.
