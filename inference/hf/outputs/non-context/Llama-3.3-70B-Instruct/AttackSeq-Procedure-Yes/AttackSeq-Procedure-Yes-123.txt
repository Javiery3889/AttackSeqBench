To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) implied:

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from Command and Control (C2) servers. This implies an established communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure, which is a common TTP in many cyber attacks for sending and receiving data, including reconnaissance information and malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: 
   - The sequence starts with the 'IPsec Helper' awaiting commands, indicating a stage where the attacker has already gained access and is preparing for further actions.
   - The actions mentioned include sending recon information and downloading files, which are typical steps in the reconnaissance and weaponization phases of an attack.
   - The question then mentions the deployment of the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction activities. This implies a progression towards the impact phase of the attack, where the goal is to cause damage or disrupt operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This choice suggests that after establishing communication and potentially gathering information or downloading necessary tools, the next logical step could indeed be to deploy malware designed for data destruction, such as a wiper ('Apostle') and a file overwriting tool ('DEADWOOD'). This sequence aligns with an attacker's goal to disrupt or destroy data after gaining access and gathering intelligence.
   - **Option B (No)**: This choice implies that the deployment of such destructive malware would not follow the described sequence of events, which seems less likely given the context. The establishment of a C2 channel and the actions of sending recon information or downloading files typically precede more destructive actions in a cyber attack lifecycle.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The attacker has established a means of communication with the compromised system ('IPsec Helper' awaiting commands).
   - The attacker is likely gathering information or preparing the system for further exploitation (sending recon information or downloading files).
   - The next logical step, given the context of cyber attack lifecycles, would be to execute the attack's primary objective, which in this case involves data destruction.
   - Deploying a wiper ('Apostle') and a file overwriting malware ('DEADWOOD') aligns with data destruction objectives.

**Final Answer: A**
