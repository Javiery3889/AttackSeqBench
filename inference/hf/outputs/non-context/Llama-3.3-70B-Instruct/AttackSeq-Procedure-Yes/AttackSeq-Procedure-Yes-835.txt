To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of such a sequence based on common attack patterns and the characteristics of malware like WinDealer.

1. **Stealing information from SNS applications**: This action aligns with the tactic of "Collection" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary collects sensitive information. Malware like WinDealer, designed for data theft, could indeed target Social Network Service (SNS) applications to gather user data, which might include login credentials, personal messages, or other sensitive information.

2. **Encrypting the data using AES**: Encryption is a common technique used by adversaries to protect stolen data from being intercepted and read during exfiltration. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used encryption algorithm due to its strength and efficiency. This step aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic and the "Encrypted Channel" technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary encrypts data to prevent detection and interception.

3. **Communicating with C2 servers using non-standard ports such as UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556**: Adversaries often use non-standard ports for Command and Control (C2) communications to evade detection by traditional security measures that monitor common ports. Using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556 for C2 communication is plausible as it falls under the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the "Non-Standard Port" technique.

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with known behaviors of malware designed for data theft and evasion. WinDealer, if it is a piece of malware designed for such purposes, could reasonably be expected to engage in these activities as part of its operational cycle.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- **Step 1**: Identify the TTPs - Stealing information, encrypting data with AES, and communicating with C2 servers on non-standard ports.
- **Step 2**: Evaluate each TTP in the context of known malware behaviors and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- **Step 3**: Determine the likelihood of this sequence based on the evaluation.

**Final Answer: A**
