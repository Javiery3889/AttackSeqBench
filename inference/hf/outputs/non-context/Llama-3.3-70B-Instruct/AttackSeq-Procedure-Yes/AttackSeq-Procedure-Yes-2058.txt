To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario presented:

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The attackers have already gained access to the ATMs, installed malicious software, and are issuing commands to manipulate the ATM's operating system registry. This indicates they have achieved initial access and are executing their malicious code on the target systems.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: By manipulating the ATM operating system registry, they are likely escalating their privileges to gain higher levels of access to the system, which is a common TTP to achieve more significant control over the compromised system.

3. **Credential Access**: The question mentions the use of compromised domain administrator passwords. This implies that the attackers have obtained credentials, possibly through their initial exploitation or subsequent actions like dumping password hashes from the compromised ATMs or other systems on the network. This is a crucial step for lateral movement and further exploitation.

4. **Lateral Movement**: With domain administrator passwords, the attackers can indeed gain access to all active domain accounts. This access would allow them to move laterally within the network, adding new administrator accounts, or using tools like RDP Wrapper to enable concurrent RDP sessions. These actions facilitate further control, persistence, and potential exfiltration of data or additional malicious activities.

Given this sequence of TTPs:
- The attackers have demonstrated the capability to gain initial access and execute malicious code.
- They have shown an ability to escalate privileges within the compromised systems.
- The use of compromised domain administrator passwords for lateral movement is a logical next step, given their goal of maximizing control and access within the network.

Therefore, it is plausible that after compromising the ATMs and obtaining higher privileges, the attackers would use compromised domain administrator passwords to facilitate further lateral movement, such as adding additional administrator accounts or using RDP Wrapper for concurrent RDP sessions.
