To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of such an attack based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes an attack that starts with a PDF attachment that is sent to the target. This PDF attachment is designed to appear benign and successfully passes through security filters. After the initial stage, the attack involves evading detection by utilizing legitimate tools and scripts for its operations. This implies the use of living-off-the-land (LOTL) tactics, where attackers leverage existing tools and applications already present on the compromised system to carry out malicious activities, making it harder for security systems to detect the attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Initial Access**: The attack begins with a PDF attachment sent to the target, which suggests a phishing campaign or a similar social engineering tactic aimed at gaining initial access to the system.
   - **Defense Evasion**: The use of a benign-appearing PDF that passes through security filters indicates an attempt to evade detection. Further evasion techniques are employed by using legitimate tools and scripts, which is a common method to blend in with normal system activity and avoid raising alarms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Option A (Yes)**: This choice suggests that the described sequence of events is plausible. Given the context, it aligns with known TTPs where attackers use social engineering (e.g., phishing with malicious attachments) for initial access and then employ defense evasion techniques, such as using legitimate system tools (LOTL tactics), to maintain access and carry out further malicious activities without being detected.
   - **Option B (No)**: This choice implies that the sequence is unlikely. However, based on the commonality of phishing attacks and the use of LOTL tactics for evasion, this option seems less likely to be correct.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial vector (a PDF attachment) is a common method used in phishing campaigns to gain initial access to a system.
   - The ability of the attachment to pass through security filters as benign suggests it was crafted to evade initial detection, which is a realistic scenario given the sophistication of current phishing attacks.
   - The subsequent use of legitimate tools and scripts for operations is a well-documented tactic (LOTL) used by attackers to evade detection and persist within a compromised environment.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the plausibility of the attack sequence described, which aligns with known TTPs including initial access through social engineering and defense evasion using legitimate system tools, the most appropriate answer is:
**Final Answer: A**
