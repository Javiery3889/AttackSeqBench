To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario described and evaluate the likelihood of the data being exfiltrated and stored as mentioned.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a specific sequence of actions attributed to Yellow Garuda, involving the use of a Telegram 'grabber' tool to collect various types of data from victims' Telegram accounts. The data collected includes messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. The question then asks if it is likely that these collected data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) here involves:
   - **Data Collection**: Using a Telegram 'grabber' tool to collect specific data from victims' accounts.
   - **Data Exfiltration**: The potential act of transferring the collected data out of the compromised system or environment.
   - **Data Storage**: The storage of exfiltrated data in specific formats (SQLite database and JSON).

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Data Collection**: The use of a 'grabber' tool for data collection from Telegram accounts is a plausible initial step in a cyber attack, aligning with the technique of collecting data from a specific application (in this case, Telegram).
   - **Data Exfiltration over the Web**: Exfiltrating data over the web is a common TTP used by attackers to transfer stolen data from a compromised system to their controlled servers or storage. This method is often used due to its ease of implementation and the difficulty in detecting such transfers, especially if encrypted.
   - **Storage in SQLite Database and JSON Format**: SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained database that can be easily used for storing and managing data locally or on a server. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for data interchange, making it a plausible choice for storing structured data collected from various sources. Both formats are versatile and can be easily managed, analyzed, or transmitted further.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial collection of data using a specialized tool indicates a targeted effort to gather specific information, likely for further analysis or exploitation.
   - The exfiltration of this data over the web is a logical next step, given the need to access and utilize the collected data outside the compromised environment.
   - The storage in SQLite and JSON formats suggests an intention to organize, possibly analyze, and utilize the data in a structured manner, which aligns with common practices in cyber espionage or information theft campaigns.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the logical progression of the described TTPs and the common practices observed in cyber attacks, it is reasonable to conclude that the collected data would indeed be exfiltrated and stored as described.

Final Answer: A
