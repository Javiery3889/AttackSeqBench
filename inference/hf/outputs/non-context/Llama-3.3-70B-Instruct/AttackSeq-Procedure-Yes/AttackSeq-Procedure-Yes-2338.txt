To answer this question, let's break down the key components and analyze them in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and general cybersecurity principles.

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The use of a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a malicious URL every two hours is a method of establishing persistence (TTP: Persistence, specifically Scheduled Task/Job - T1053). This allows the malware to maintain its presence on the victim's system over time.

2. **RevengeRAT**: RevengeRAT is a type of remote access trojan (RAT) known for its capabilities in establishing command and control (C2) communications, data exfiltration, and executing commands on the victim's machine. Its behavior aligns with several techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, including Command and Control (T1043) and Data Exfiltration (ex: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - T1048).

3. **Communication with C2 Servers**: Given that RevengeRAT is designed to communicate with C2 servers, it is plausible that after establishing persistence, it would attempt to send and receive data from these servers. The domains mentioned ('office365update[.]duckdns.org' and 'systen32.ddns[.]net') could be used as part of the C2 infrastructure, leveraging DNS (Domain Name System) as a communication channel, which is a known tactic (Application Window Discovery - T1010, and more specifically, using Application Layer Protocol - T1071 for C2).

4. **Geographical Location of Infrastructure**: The mention of the attacker's infrastructure being located in Canada and Brazil suggests that the campaign might involve servers or compromised hosts in these regions. This is consistent with the tactics of various threat actors who often use distributed infrastructure across different countries to host their C2 servers, making it harder to track and mitigate their activities.

Given these points, the scenario described fits within the known behaviors of RevengeRAT and common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after establishing persistence, RevengeRAT would indeed attempt to communicate with its C2 servers and could use the mentioned domains for such purposes, especially considering the geographical distribution of the attacker's infrastructure.
