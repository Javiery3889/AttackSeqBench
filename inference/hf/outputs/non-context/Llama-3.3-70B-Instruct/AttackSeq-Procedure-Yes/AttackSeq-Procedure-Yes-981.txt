To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the Komplex malware based on the given information and general knowledge about malware tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions attributed to the Komplex malware. First, the Komplex Dropper ensures persistence by creating directories and modifying file permissions. This action is associated with the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary tries to maintain their access to a system over time.

2. **Understanding the Komplex Malware Components**:
   - **Komplex Dropper**: This component is responsible for the initial installation and persistence of the malware on a victim's system. By creating directories and modifying file permissions, it ensures that the malware can survive system restarts and maintain its foothold.
   - **Komplex Binder**: If the Komplex Binder is mentioned in the context of executing the actual payload and opening a decoy PDF, this would align with tactics related to "Defense Evasion" and potentially "Execution" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Defense Evasion techniques are used by adversaries to evade detection, and using a decoy document is a common method to distract users while malicious activities are performed in the background.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The initial action by the Komplex Dropper sets the stage for the malware's persistence.
   - The subsequent action by the Komplex Binder, executing the payload while displaying a decoy PDF, serves to evade detection and potentially to execute the malware's primary function without alerting the user.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the described sequence of actions and the typical behaviors associated with malware components like droppers and binders, it is plausible that after ensuring persistence, the Komplex malware would proceed with executing its payload while using a decoy to evade detection. This aligns with common malware tactics aimed at maintaining access and executing malicious activities without being detected.
