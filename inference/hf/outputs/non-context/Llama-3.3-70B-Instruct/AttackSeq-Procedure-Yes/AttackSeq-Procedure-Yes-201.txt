To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like FamousSparrow.

1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with FamousSparrow gaining initial access through the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in various software products (Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera). This is a plausible initial access technique as threat actors often exploit known vulnerabilities to gain a foothold in a target network.

2. **Resource Development**: After gaining initial access, the question mentions acquiring infrastructure from specific companies (Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY) for Resource Development. This step involves setting up or obtaining resources (like servers or domains) that can be used to support further malicious activities. It's common for threat actors to use various infrastructure providers to host their command and control (C2) servers, malware repositories, or for other malicious purposes.

3. **Execution and Persistence**: The final step mentioned involves using cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor. This action is consistent with tactics aimed at establishing persistence and potentially escalating privileges within the compromised network. The use of cmd.exe for executing commands is a common technique, and installing a backdoor like SparrowDoor would allow the threat actor to maintain access to the compromised system.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the described sequence of events is likely. Considering the tactics and techniques described, it aligns with common practices of threat actors. Gaining initial access, setting up infrastructure for further operations, and then using that access to install backdoors for persistence are all well-documented TTPs in the cyber threat landscape.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the sequence is unlikely. However, based on the analysis, each step in the sequence is a plausible action for a threat actor aiming to compromise and maintain access to a target network.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access method is plausible as it involves exploiting known vulnerabilities.
2. Acquiring infrastructure for resource development is a common practice among threat actors for supporting their operations.
3. The use of cmd.exe to download and install a backdoor is consistent with tactics for establishing persistence.

**Final Answer**: A
