To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the backdoor communicating with a Command and Control (C&C) server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.

1. **Gathering Detailed Information**: The attackers have already gathered detailed information about the victim's computer. This step is typically associated with the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers seek to gather information about the system, network, or organization.

2. **Backdoor Installation**: The installation of a backdoor is associated with the "Persistence" tactic, allowing attackers to maintain access to the system. Backdoors can be used for a variety of purposes, including establishing a C&C channel.

3. **Communication with C&C Server**: The use of a backdoor to communicate with a C&C server is a common tactic (associated with "Command and Control" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework). This communication can be used for sending commands to the compromised system and receiving data from it.

4. **Use of Encrypted Channel**: The use of an encrypted channel for C&C communication is a technique (often associated with "Command and Control" and specifically with "Encrypted Channel" sub-techniques) that attackers use to hide their communications from detection. Given the sensitive nature of the data being exfiltrated (screenshots and system information), using an encrypted channel would be a logical step to avoid detection.

5. **Exfiltration of Data**: The exfiltration of data such as screenshots and system information is associated with the "Exfiltration" tactic. This data can be valuable for further attacks or for selling on the dark web.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common attack patterns observed in the wild. The use of encryption for C&C communication is particularly plausible as it helps attackers evade detection by network monitoring tools.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The attackers have already shown an interest in the victim's system by gathering detailed information.
- Installing a backdoor is a common method for maintaining access and facilitating further malicious activities.
- Using an encrypted channel for C&C communication is a logical step to avoid detection, especially when exfiltrating potentially sensitive data.
- Exfiltrating data such as screenshots and system information through the established C&C channel follows the pattern of exploiting the access gained for intelligence gathering or financial gain.

**Final Answer: A**
