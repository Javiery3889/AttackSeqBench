To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the Derusbi malware in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and general malware tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question involves the use of the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) for evasion, followed by the actions of Derusbi malware. The key TTPs mentioned are:
   - Modifying the system's global call table using a Linux Kernel Module (LKM) for evasion.
   - Gathering system information about the victim host.
   - Binding to a raw socket.
   - Initiating communication with a Command and Control (C2) server.

2. **Understanding Derusbi and LKM**: Derusbi is a type of malware, and its use in conjunction with a Linux Kernel Module (LKM) like Turbo for evasion techniques suggests a sophisticated attack. The LKM is used to modify system calls, potentially to hide the malware's activities or to gain elevated privileges.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - **Gathering System Information**: After establishing a foothold and evading detection, it is common for malware to gather system information. This includes details about the operating system, installed software, network configuration, and other relevant data that could be useful for further exploitation or for reporting back to the C2 server.
   - **Binding to a Raw Socket and C2 Communication**: Binding to a raw socket allows the malware to communicate directly with the network layer, enabling it to send and receive data without the need for higher-layer protocols. This is a common technique for establishing a covert channel to a C2 server.

4. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - Given the context, it is logical that after evading detection, the malware would gather system information. This information is crucial for the attackers to understand the victim's environment, identify potential vulnerabilities, and decide on the next steps, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further exploitation.
   - The act of binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with a C2 server follows naturally after gathering system information, as the malware would need to report back to its operators and potentially receive further instructions or payloads.

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   1. The use of an LKM for evasion indicates a sophisticated attack aiming to remain stealthy.
   2. Gathering system information is a typical next step after establishing a foothold, as it informs the attacker about potential vulnerabilities and valuable data.
   3. Communicating with a C2 server is necessary for the malware to receive instructions and exfiltrate data, which aligns with the goals of most malware campaigns.

**Final Answer: A**
