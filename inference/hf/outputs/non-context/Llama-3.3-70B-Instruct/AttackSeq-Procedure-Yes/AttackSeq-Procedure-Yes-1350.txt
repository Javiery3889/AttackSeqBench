To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the events unfolding as stated in the question.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing and Exploitation of CVE-2015-5119**: The attack begins with a spear-phishing campaign that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access to the target system. This step is plausible as CVE-2015-5119 is a known vulnerability in Adobe Flash that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

2. **Execution of Shellcode for Defense Evasion**: After gaining initial access, the question suggests that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will attempt to execute shellcode for defense evasion. Defense evasion techniques are commonly used by attackers to avoid detection by security software. Executing shellcode that implements defense evasion tactics before installing a payload is a logical step for an attacker, as it increases the chances of the payload going undetected.

3. **Installation of Payload Embedded in a GIF Image**: The question then mentions the installation of a payload embedded in a GIF image. This could be a part of the attack where the initial exploit leads to the download and execution of additional malware or tools, potentially hidden or encoded within seemingly innocuous files like images.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the Flash file will attempt to execute shellcode for defense evasion before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image. This sequence makes sense from an attacker's perspective, as evading defenses first would make it more likely for the subsequent payload installation to succeed without being detected.

- **B: No**: This choice implies that the execution of shellcode for defense evasion would not occur before the installation of the payload, or perhaps not at all in this sequence. However, given the context, it seems less likely that an attacker would proceed with installing a payload without first attempting to ensure that their actions would go undetected.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial exploit (CVE-2015-5119) is used to gain access, which is a common entry point for such attacks.
2. The use of defense evasion techniques is a standard practice to avoid detection.
3. Installing a payload, especially one embedded in a file like a GIF, would logically follow after measures have been taken to reduce the likelihood of detection.

**Final Answer**: A
