To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate its plausibility based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions accessing the victim's VPN using credentials obtained through password spraying. This aligns with the "Valid Accounts" and "Brute Force" techniques under the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Password spraying is a common method used by adversaries to gain initial access to a network.

2. **Execution**: The use of a PowerShell one-liner to install the Cobalt Strike beacon is a technique often seen in attacks. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that can be used by adversaries for command and control (C2) communications. The use of PowerShell for execution aligns with the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique under the "Execution" tactic.

3. **Persistence and Execution**: After gaining access and installing the beacon, the adversary leveraged scheduled tasks to execute a batch file. This aligns with the "Scheduled Task" technique under the "Persistence" tactic and the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique under the "Execution" tactic. Scheduled tasks can be used to maintain persistence on a system and execute commands or scripts at specific times or intervals.

Given this sequence:
- The initial access method (password spraying to gain VPN access) is plausible and commonly used.
- The execution method (using PowerShell to install a beacon) is also a known TTP used by adversaries for establishing C2 channels.
- The use of scheduled tasks for persistence and execution of further commands/scripts is a logical step for maintaining access and performing additional malicious activities.

Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question forms a coherent and plausible attack sequence based on known adversary behaviors and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
