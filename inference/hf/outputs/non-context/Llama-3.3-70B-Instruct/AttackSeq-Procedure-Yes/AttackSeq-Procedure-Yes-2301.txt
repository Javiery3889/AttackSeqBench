To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on common adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The adversary gains initial access to the victim's network through compromised remote services such as VPN or Citrix. This aligns with the "Exploit Remote Services" technique (T1190) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access.

2. **Execution**: The adversary executes the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that can be used by adversaries to execute commands and payloads on compromised systems. Executing a beacon in memory suggests the use of "Execution" techniques, possibly "In-Memory Execution" or more specifically, "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (T1059) if scripts are used to execute the beacon.

3. **Persistence**: The adversary aims to achieve persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes, such as servers. This is a common tactic because servers are typically always on and provide a stable platform for maintaining access. Techniques like "Scheduled Task/Job" (T1053) can be used for persistence, where an adversary schedules a task to execute a program or script at a specified time or interval, potentially to re-establish access or execute malicious code.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**, it is plausible that after gaining initial access, an adversary would use scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory as part of maintaining access and achieving persistence. Scheduled tasks can be used to periodically execute the beacon, ensuring continued access to the compromised network, especially if the beacon is set to run on systems with high uptimes like servers. This approach aligns with known TTPs used by adversaries to maintain a foothold in a network.

- **B: No**, this choice suggests that it is not likely for an adversary to use scheduled tasks for executing the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory before achieving persistence by targeting high-uptime systems. However, given the common use of scheduled tasks for persistence and the strategic value of targeting servers, this option seems less likely to be correct.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The adversary gains access through remote services.
2. Executes a Cobalt Strike beacon in memory for command and control.
3. Uses scheduled tasks for persistence, targeting high-uptime systems like servers.

**Final Answer: A**
