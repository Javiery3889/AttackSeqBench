To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the malware's actions following the collection phase.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malware, referred to as T9000, has already stolen sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives. This action is part of the collection phase of an attack, where an adversary gathers sensitive information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - **Collection**: Stealing sensitive data from specific sources (Skype communications and removable drives).
   - The question then inquires about the next likely step after collection, specifically whether the malware will compress and encrypt the stolen data for exfiltration over a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - **Exfiltration**: This is the technique used by attackers to transfer stolen data from a compromised system to an external system or adversary-controlled server. Common methods include using encryption and compression to evade detection and efficiently transfer data.
   - Given that the malware has already collected sensitive data, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to exfiltrate this data back to the attackers. To do this effectively and avoid detection, compressing and encrypting the data is a common TTP used by adversaries.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The malware collects sensitive data, which has been done.
   - **Step 2**: To exfiltrate the data without being detected, the malware needs to prepare it for transfer. This typically involves reducing the data size (through compression) and protecting it from being intercepted and read (through encryption).
   - **Step 3**: The encrypted and compressed data is then sent over a C2 channel, which is a controlled communication channel used by the attackers to issue commands to the malware and receive stolen data.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of the attack sequence and the common TTPs used by malware, it is logical to conclude that after collecting sensitive data, the malware would indeed compress and encrypt this data for exfiltration over a C2 channel to efficiently and securely transfer the stolen information back to the attackers.
