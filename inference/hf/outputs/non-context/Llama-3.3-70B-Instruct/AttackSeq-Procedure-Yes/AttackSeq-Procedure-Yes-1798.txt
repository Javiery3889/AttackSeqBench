To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the given information.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL. This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which can help in evasion, making it harder for security software to detect the malicious activity. The question then asks if it's likely that the malware will connect back to a specific domain (pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org) for command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned involves:
   - **Defense Evasion**: Using sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL, which is a technique used to evade detection by security controls.
   - **Command and Control**: The potential communication back to a C2 server (pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org) for further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - **Sideloading** is a technique often used by attackers to load malicious code into a legitimate process, which can be a precursor to establishing a foothold within a network.
   - **Command and Control** communication is a common next step after initial compromise, where the malware communicates with a C2 server to receive instructions, upload stolen data, or download additional malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The use of sideloading for deploying a malicious DLL suggests an attempt to evade security controls and establish a persistent presence within the target system.
   - Establishing C2 communication is a logical next step for the attacker to leverage the compromised system for further malicious activities.
   - The specific domain mentioned (pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org) could be a C2 server set up by the attackers to manage compromised systems.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of using sideloading for evasion and the typical goals of such attacks, it is plausible that the malware would connect back to a designated C2 server for further instructions or data exfiltration. Therefore, connecting back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org during C2 communication aligns with common attack patterns.
