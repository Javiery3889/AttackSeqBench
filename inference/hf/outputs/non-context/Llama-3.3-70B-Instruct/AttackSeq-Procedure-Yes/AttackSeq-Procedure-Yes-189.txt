To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in analyzing the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario involving the Infamous Chisel's netd component, which is engaged in the discovery phase. This phase involves gathering information about the target system, such as enumerating directories and collecting system information. The question then asks if, following this phase, the component is likely to automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described starts with discovery (enumerating directories and gathering system information), which aligns with techniques under the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, such as T1204 (User Execution) for initial access and potentially T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) for enumerating directories. The next step mentioned is the collection phase, which involves collecting files based on specific criteria (predefined list of file extensions), aligning with techniques under the "Collection" tactic, such as T1005 (Data from Local System) and specifically T1025 (Data from Removable Media) if the collection involves removable media, though the latter is not explicitly mentioned.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**: 
   - **Option A (Yes)**: Given that the netd component is already engaged in gathering detailed information about the system and has demonstrated the capability to enumerate directories, it is plausible that its next step would involve collecting specific files based on predefined criteria. This action would align with the natural progression of an attack from discovery to collection, where an adversary seeks to gather valuable data.
   - **Option B (No)**: This option suggests that the component would not proceed to collect files automatically based on a predefined list of file extensions. However, given the context that the component is designed to gather system information and enumerate directories, it seems less likely that it would not proceed to a more targeted data collection phase, especially since such an action is a common next step in the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**:
   - The discovery phase activities described (enumerating directories and gathering system information) are typical precursor actions to more targeted data collection.
   - The collection of files based on a predefined list of file extensions is a logical next step for an adversary seeking to exfiltrate specific, potentially valuable data.
   - Given the capabilities and actions already demonstrated by the netd component, it is reasonable to expect that it would proceed to collect files in a targeted manner.

Final Answer: A
