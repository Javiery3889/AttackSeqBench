To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and evaluate the plausibility of the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described:

1. **Initial Data Collection**: The Welcome Chat app collects device information and GPS location. This action aligns with the technique of "Collection" as defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under "Collect Host Information" and possibly "Collect Location Information".

2. **Sending Recorded Phone Calls to C&C Server**: The next step mentioned is sending recorded phone calls to the Command and Control (C&C) server for exfiltration. This action corresponds to the "Exfiltration" tactic, specifically the technique of "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel". Recording phone calls without the user's consent is a significant invasion of privacy and would typically require specific permissions or exploits to achieve, especially on modern mobile devices with robust security measures.

3. **Establishing a Routine of Contacting the C&C Server**: The final step involves establishing a routine where the app contacts the C&C server every five minutes to upload additional data. This behavior is consistent with the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically the technique of "Application Window Discovery" or more broadly, maintaining a C2 channel for ongoing communication and potential further instruction.

Given these steps, the question essentially asks whether it's plausible for an app, after initial data collection, to exfiltrate sensitive data (recorded phone calls) before establishing a regular communication schedule with its C&C server.

**Evaluation**:
- The initial collection of device and location information is a common first step for many types of malware or spyware to understand the environment they are operating in.
- The exfiltration of recorded phone calls directly after initial data collection, before establishing a regular C2 communication channel, could be seen as a high-priority action for an adversary seeking to gather sensitive information quickly.
- Establishing a routine of contacting the C&C server every five minutes for uploading additional data suggests an ongoing effort to monitor the device and potentially receive further instructions, which is a common behavior for malware.

**Conclusion**:
Given the logical progression from initial data collection, to the exfiltration of sensitive data, and then to the establishment of a regular communication channel for potential further instructions or data upload, the sequence described does follow a plausible attack pattern. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that after collecting initial data, the app might prioritize sending sensitive information (like recorded calls) back to the C&C server before settling into a routine of regular check-ins for further data exfiltration or instructions.
