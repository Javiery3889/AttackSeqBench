To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: The question starts with the exploitation of CVE-2017-9841, a vulnerability in PHPUnit, to gain initial access to the system. This aligns with the "Exploitation of Remote Services" technique under the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Execution**: After gaining access, the Tuyul malware executes Perl scripts and shell commands. This action corresponds to the "Command and Scripting Interpreter" technique, which falls under the "Execution" tactic. Malware often uses scripting interpreters to execute commands that can lead to further exploitation or establishment of a foothold within the system.

3. **Persistence**: The malware then periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence. This action aligns with the "Cron Job" technique under the "Persistence" tactic. Cron jobs are a common method for maintaining persistence on Unix-like systems, allowing malware to execute commands or scripts at regular intervals.

Given this sequence of TTPs:
- **Exploitation** for initial access,
- **Execution** of scripts and commands for establishing a foothold or gathering information,
- **Persistence** mechanisms to maintain access over time,

The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern. The exploitation of a known vulnerability to gain access, followed by the execution of scripts to potentially elevate privileges or move laterally, and finally, establishing a persistence mechanism to ensure continued access, is a well-documented and understood sequence of events in the context of cyber attacks.

Therefore, considering the logical progression from initial access, through execution, to persistence, and the specific mention of techniques that align with known TTPs used by malware, the answer to whether it is likely that the Tuyul malware will execute these actions as described is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
