To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate the likelihood of the campaign creating multiple files, including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads, before achieving persistence.

1. **Initial Access**: The campaign starts with social engineering, using malicious documents to trick victims into enabling macros. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain initial access to a system. The use of macros in documents is a well-documented TTP, often associated with the "Phishing" technique (T1566) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Execution**: Once macros are enabled, the payload is activated. This could involve various techniques, including executing a command or script (T1204), potentially leading to the execution of PowerShell scripts, which are commonly used for their flexibility and ability to execute system commands.

3. **Creating Multiple Files**: The creation of multiple files, including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads, aligns with techniques used for defense evasion (e.g., T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information) and execution (e.g., T1086 - PowerShell). Attackers often create or download additional files to facilitate further malicious activities, such as establishing persistence, escalating privileges, or moving laterally within a network.

4. **Persistence**: Achieving persistence by adding script paths to the task scheduler is a technique (T1050 - New Service) that allows the malware to survive system restarts. This is a common goal for attackers, as it enables them to maintain access to the compromised system over time.

Given this sequence of TTPs:
- The initial use of social engineering to enable macros for payload activation is a known and effective method for gaining initial access.
- The creation of multiple files, including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads, is consistent with techniques used for execution and defense evasion.
- Achieving persistence through modifying the task scheduler is a logical next step to ensure continued access.

Therefore, it is plausible that after using social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros, the campaign would create multiple files (including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads) as part of its execution and defense evasion tactics before achieving persistence by modifying the task scheduler.
