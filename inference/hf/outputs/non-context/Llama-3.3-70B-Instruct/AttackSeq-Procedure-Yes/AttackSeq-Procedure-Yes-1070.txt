To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the actions based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers, as well as the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Implementing checks for security software during malware deployment to evade detection**: This action aligns with the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Attackers often check for security software to ensure their malware remains undetected, allowing them to maintain access to the compromised system.

2. **Executing a series of commands to collect system information**: This action corresponds to the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Collecting system information is a common step after initial access, as it helps attackers understand the environment, identify potential targets, and plan further actions.

3. **Capturing screenshots from infected machines under the SLUB variant**: Capturing screenshots can be part of the "Collection" tactic, where attackers gather information that might be useful for their goals, such as understanding the system's configuration, identifying sensitive data, or monitoring user activity.

4. **Exfiltrating this information to the Mattermost server**: Exfiltration is the act of transferring data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system, which aligns with the "Exfiltration" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Using a server like Mattermost, which is a self-hosted, open-source communication platform, as a command and control (C2) channel or for data exfiltration is plausible, as attackers often use legitimate services and tools to blend in and avoid detection.

Given these points, the sequence of actions described in the question follows a logical and common pattern of attack behavior:
- Evade detection to maintain access.
- Gather information about the system and its users.
- Collect specific data of interest (in this case, screenshots).
- Exfiltrate the collected data to an attacker-controlled server for further analysis or use.

Therefore, it is indeed likely that after evading detection, attackers would proceed to collect system information, capture screenshots, and then exfiltrate this data, especially if their goals include reconnaissance, data theft, or further exploitation of the compromised systems.
