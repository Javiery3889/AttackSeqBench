To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the situation based on the information provided and general knowledge of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question describes a scenario where malicious macros have been injected into Word and Excel documents. This action is typically associated with the "Lateral Movement" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as it allows attackers to move laterally within a network by exploiting trusted systems and files. The specific group mentioned, Gamaredon, is known for its sophisticated cyber espionage operations.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: The sequence here involves:
   - **Initial Access**: Not explicitly mentioned but implied through the compromise of systems.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Achieved through injecting malicious macros into documents, which would allow the malware to spread within the network when these documents are opened on other systems.
   - **Collection**: The phase where attackers gather sensitive information. The question asks if, after lateral movement, the malware would search for sensitive documents during this phase.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after establishing lateral movement, the next logical step for the malware would be to search for and collect sensitive documents. This aligns with typical cyber espionage goals, where the primary objective is often to gather sensitive or classified information.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that the malware might not proceed to search for sensitive documents after lateral movement, which seems less likely given the context of a cyber espionage operation aimed at collecting sensitive information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Understand the context of the attack, which involves lateral movement via malicious document macros.
   - **Step 2**: Recognize the goal of the Gamaredon group, which is typically associated with cyber espionage and the collection of sensitive information.
   - **Step 3**: Align the tactics with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, noting that collection of sensitive data is a common objective after establishing access and lateral movement.
   - **Step 4**: Determine the most plausible next step based on the group's objectives and the tactics employed.

**Final Answer: A**
