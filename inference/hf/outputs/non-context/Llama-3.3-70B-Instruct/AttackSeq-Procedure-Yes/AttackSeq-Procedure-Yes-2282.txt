To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the Regin malware based on known characteristics and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes a sequence of actions that include:
   - Discovering information on processes and memory utilization.
   - Scanning for deleted files.
   - Monitoring network traffic to Microsoft IIS web servers.
   - Crawling through the file system and gathering computer information for the purpose of collection.
   - Encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.

2. **Understanding Regin Malware**: Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its complex and modular architecture. It is designed for long-term espionage and has been associated with various advanced threat actors. Its capabilities include:
   - Gathering information about the infected system and network.
   - Monitoring and controlling the system.
   - Exfiltrating data.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation**:
   - **Discovering Information and Scanning**: Regin's initial steps often involve reconnaissance, which aligns with discovering information on processes, memory utilization, and scanning for deleted files. This phase is crucial for understanding the target environment.
   - **Monitoring Network Traffic**: Monitoring network traffic, especially to specific servers like Microsoft IIS, fits within Regin's capabilities, as it aims to gather intelligence on the network and potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Crawling Through the File System**: This action is consistent with Regin's information-gathering phase, where it would collect data on the file system, possibly looking for specific files or types of data.
   - **Encoding and Embedding Payload**: The use of encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data for exfiltration is a sophisticated method that aligns with advanced malware capabilities, including those of Regin, to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: Regin's initial actions involve reconnaissance, which matches the described behavior of discovering system and network information.
   - **Step 2**: The malware's capability to monitor network traffic and scan for specific data (like deleted files) aligns with its espionage goals.
   - **Step 3**: Crawling through the file system for collection purposes is a plausible next step after initial reconnaissance, fitting Regin's modus operandi.
   - **Step 4**: Encoding and embedding payload information for exfiltration is a sophisticated method used by advanced malware, including Regin, to hide data transmission.

5. **Final Answer**: Given the sequence of actions described and the known capabilities of Regin malware, it is reasonable to conclude that after discovering information and monitoring network traffic, Regin would indeed crawl through the file system, gather computer information, and then encode and embed payload information within cookie data for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
