To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the scenario and analyze them in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common cyber threat intelligence (CTI) practices.

1. **Initial Access and Scanning**: The question starts with Suckfly scanning the corporate internal network for hosts with specific ports open (8080, 5900, and 40). This action is typically associated with the "Discovery" tactic (TA0007) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary seeks to gather information about the internal network, such as open ports and services, to identify potential targets for further exploitation.

2. **Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation**: After identifying potential targets, the next logical steps for an adversary like Suckfly would involve moving laterally within the network to expand their foothold and escalating privileges to gain greater control over the network and its systems. This is consistent with the "Lateral Movement" (TA0008) and "Privilege Escalation" (TA0004) tactics. Using hacktools for these purposes is a common practice among adversaries, as it allows them to exploit vulnerabilities, use stolen credentials, or manipulate system features to achieve their goals.

3. **Command and Control (C2) Communication**: The use of a backdoor like Nidiran for C2 communication, especially one that sends encrypted and hardcoded data, aligns with the "Command and Control" (TA0011) tactic. This tactic involves establishing a communication channel between the compromised system and the adversary's C2 server, allowing the adversary to issue commands and receive stolen data.

Given these steps, the sequence of actions described in the question follows a logical and common pattern of adversary behavior:
- **Scanning** for vulnerable targets,
- **Lateral Movement** and **Privilege Escalation** to expand access and control,
- **Command and Control** for remote manipulation and data exfiltration.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after scanning the network, Suckfly would likely use hacktools to move laterally and escalate privileges before establishing C2 communication using a backdoor.
