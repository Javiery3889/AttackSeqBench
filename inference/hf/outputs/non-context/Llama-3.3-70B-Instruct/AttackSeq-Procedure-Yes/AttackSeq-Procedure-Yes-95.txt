To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and analyze the likelihood of the HTA file communicating with a Command and Control (C2) server via webserv-redir.net.

1. **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882**: This vulnerability is related to Microsoft Office and can be exploited through a specially crafted RTF document. The exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary code, which in this case drops an HTA (HTML Application) file.

2. **Dropping an HTA File**: HTA files are executable and can contain scripts (like JavaScript or VBScript) that can perform various actions on a compromised system. Dropping an HTA file is a common technique for executing malicious code on a victim's machine.

3. **Using WMI to Check for Installed Antivirus Software**: The attackers use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to gather information about the system, specifically to check for installed antivirus software. This is a reconnaissance technique used to understand the security posture of the compromised system and to decide whether to proceed with the attack.

4. **Executing the FinalBot Backdoor with DLL Sideloading for Defense Evasion**: FinalBot is a backdoor that can be used for various malicious activities, including data exfiltration, command execution, and more. DLL sideloading is a technique used for defense evasion, where a legitimate process is tricked into loading a malicious DLL, making the malicious activity appear as part of legitimate system operations.

5. **Communication with the C2 Server via webserv-redir.net**: The question posits that after these steps, the HTA file will communicate with a C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control. This implies that the attackers are setting up a channel for remote control of the compromised system.

Given the sequence of TTPs:
- The exploitation and initial compromise via an RTF document,
- The use of an HTA file for execution,
- The reconnaissance to ensure a safe environment for the malware,
- The deployment of a backdoor with evasion techniques,

It is logical to conclude that establishing communication with a C2 server for further commands and potential exfiltration or additional malicious activities would be a next step. The use of webserv-redir.net could serve as a means to redirect or proxy the communication, potentially for evasion of detection or to make tracking more difficult.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The initial exploitation and dropping of an HTA file indicate a targeted attack aimed at executing malicious code.
2. The use of WMI for reconnaissance suggests the attackers are cautious and want to ensure their activities remain undetected.
3. The deployment of a backdoor with DLL sideloading indicates a desire for persistence and evasion.
4. Establishing a C2 channel is a common next step for backdoor operations, allowing for remote control and potential further exploitation.

**Final Answer: A**
