To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario presented in the question.

1. **Analysis of the Question**: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spear phishing emails. These emails contain links to RTF (Rich Text Format) documents that exploit a specific vulnerability, CVE-2017-8759 (though the question mentions CVE-2017-8750, it's likely referring to the vulnerability associated with the delivery of malware via RTF documents, which is more closely related to CVE-2017-8759). The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to the delivery of QuasarRAT, a remote access trojan. The question asks whether, after clicking on the link and before getting infected with QuasarRAT, it's likely that the recipients will see a document that appears to be a legitimate blog post or report.

2. **Understanding the Exploitation Process**: When a user clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious document (in this case, an RTF document exploiting CVE-2017-8759), the exploit code executes, leading to the download and installation of malware, in this case, QuasarRAT. The exploitation of CVE-2017-8759 involves the use of a malicious RTF file that, when opened, executes the exploit, potentially displaying the contents of the RTF document to the user while silently downloading and installing the malware in the background.

3. **Presentation of Legitimate Content**: It's a common tactic in social engineering and phishing attacks to present the victim with content that appears legitimate or expected to reduce suspicion. In the context of exploiting vulnerabilities via document files, it's plausible that the document could display legitimate-appearing content (such as a blog post or report) to the user. This would serve to distract the user from the malicious activity happening in the background and increase the likelihood that the user would open the document, believing it to be harmless.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described, it is indeed likely that the attackers would want the recipients to see a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report. This would be part of the social engineering aspect of the attack, aiming to make the document appear non-malicious and increase the chances of the user opening it, thereby facilitating the infection with QuasarRAT.
