To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events described and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack begins with the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, to drop a malware downloader. This is a plausible initial access vector, as exploiting vulnerabilities in software to gain initial access is a common TTP.

2. **Execution of MSIL/Crimson Malware**: After the initial access, the execution of the MSIL/Crimson malware is mentioned. This malware is known for its ability to download and execute additional payloads, which aligns with the described behavior of downloading a full Remote Access Trojan (RAT) component.

3. **Downloading RAT Component**: The attempt to download the full RAT component from a specified IP address and port (213.136.87[.]122:10001) is consistent with the behavior of malware like MSIL/Crimson, which often relies on downloading additional components to achieve its goals, such as establishing persistence, escalating privileges, or conducting lateral movement.

4. **Establishing Command and Control (C2)**: Finally, establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol is a common technique used by malware to communicate with its command and control servers, allowing the attackers to issue commands and receive stolen data.

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with known behaviors of malware and attack patterns. The exploitation of a vulnerability for initial access, followed by the execution of a malware dropper, the download of additional malicious components, and the establishment of command and control communications are all consistent with a sophisticated cyber attack.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The initial exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 for dropping a malware downloader is a plausible initial access technique.
- The execution of MSIL/Crimson malware and its attempt to download additional components are consistent with the behavior of such malware.
- The establishment of command and control using a custom protocol is a common technique for maintaining access and controlling the compromised system.

**Final Answer**: A
