To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **System Information Discovery**: This is a technique used by attackers to gather information about the target system, which can include details such as operating system version, hardware, installed software, and network configuration. This step is typically part of the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Returning Results to the C&C Server**: After gathering system information, the malware sends this data back to its Command and Control (C&C) server. This action is part of the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically the technique of "Data Exfiltration" or more broadly, communicating with the C&C server to receive further instructions or send back collected data.

3. **Communication with C&C Infrastructure Using a Beacon**: A beacon, in the context of malware, refers to a periodic "check-in" or communication from the malware to its C&C server. This can be used to receive new commands, update the malware, or exfiltrate data. The use of a beacon is a common technique within the "Command and Control" tactic.

4. **Mimicking a Firefox Browser on Windows**: Malware often attempts to blend in with normal system activity to avoid detection. By mimicking a legitimate application like Firefox, the malware's communication with its C&C server might be disguised as regular web traffic, making it harder to detect. This is an example of "Masquerading" or "Obfuscated Files or Information" techniques within the MITRE ATT&CK framework, aimed at evading detection.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question aligns well with common TTPs used by malware:

- **Initial Discovery**: Gather system information.
- **Establish Communication**: Send the information back to the C&C server.
- **Ongoing Communication**: Use a beacon to maintain communication, potentially for receiving further instructions or exfiltrating data.
- **Evasion**: Disguise the communication as legitimate traffic (e.g., mimicking a Firefox browser) to avoid detection.

Considering these points, it is indeed plausible that after executing system information discovery commands and returning the results to the C&C server, the malware would attempt to communicate with its C&C infrastructure using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser on Windows as part of its command and control activities.
