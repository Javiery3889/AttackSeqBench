To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate how likely it is that APT28, a known advanced persistent threat group, would follow this sequence.

1. **Initial Access via DDE Technique**: The question starts with the use of a malicious Word document exploiting the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to gain initial access. This is a plausible initial vector for attack, as DDE has been used in various phishing campaigns to execute malicious code.

2. **Command and Scripting Interpreter**: The next step involves using a Command and Scripting Interpreter, specifically PowerShell, to download a file. This is a common technique used by attackers to execute commands and scripts on a compromised system. PowerShell's versatility and native presence on Windows systems make it a favorite among attackers for post-exploitation activities.

3. **Creating Persistence**: The creation of persistence through a batch file and registry entry is a standard technique used by attackers to ensure they can maintain access to a compromised system even after a reboot or other system changes. This aligns with known TTPs used by various threat actors, including APT groups.

4. **Connecting to a Command and Control (C2) Server**: Establishing communication with a C2 server is a critical step for attackers to issue commands, exfiltrate data, and drop additional malware. This is consistent with the behavior of APT28 and other sophisticated threat actors.

5. **Dropping the First-Stage Seduploader Malware**: Seduploader is known malware associated with APT28. It's used for initial reconnaissance and establishing a foothold within a network. Dropping this malware after establishing C2 communication fits the profile of APT28's tactics.

Given the sequence of TTPs described:
- The initial exploitation via a malicious document using DDE.
- The use of PowerShell for post-exploitation activities like downloading files and creating persistence.
- The establishment of a C2 channel.
- The deployment of Seduploader malware.

All these steps are consistent with the known TTPs of APT28 and other sophisticated threat actors. Therefore, it is plausible that APT28 would use this sequence of TTPs as part of their attack strategy.
