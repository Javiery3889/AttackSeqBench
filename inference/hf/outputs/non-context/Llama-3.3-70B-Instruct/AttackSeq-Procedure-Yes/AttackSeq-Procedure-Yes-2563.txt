To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in determining the likelihood of Shellbot establishing C&C (Command and Control) communication using an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel after gathering specific information about the infected host.

1. **Understanding Shellbot's Capabilities**: Shellbot is a type of malware known for its ability to infect systems and establish communication with its command and control servers. It's often used for DDoS attacks and can spread through vulnerabilities.

2. **Gathering Information**: The initial step of gathering detailed information about the infected host, such as processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools or antivirus solutions, suggests the malware is assessing the host's capabilities and potential defenses. This information can be used to tailor the attack, decide on the best method for C&C communication, and avoid detection.

3. **Establishing C&C Communication**: For malware like Shellbot, establishing a reliable and covert C&C channel is crucial for receiving commands and exfiltrating data. Common methods include using HTTP/HTTPS, DNS tunneling, and in some cases, IRC channels.

4. **Use of IRC for C&C**: IRC channels can be used for C&C communication because they offer a way to blend in with normal network traffic, potentially avoiding detection by security software that might not closely monitor IRC traffic as closely as HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

5. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: Given that Shellbot has already infected the host and is gathering detailed information, it's plausible that it could use an IRC channel for C&C communication, especially if the gathered information suggests that other methods might be heavily monitored or blocked.
   - **B: No**: This choice implies that Shellbot would not use an IRC channel for C&C communication. However, without specific reasons why IRC would be avoided (e.g., if the malware is designed to avoid IRC due to its ease of detection in certain networks), this option seems less likely given the context.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Shellbot infects a host and gathers detailed system information.
2. The malware assesses the best method for C&C communication based on the host's configuration and defenses.
3. IRC can be a viable, albeit somewhat outdated, method for C&C communication, especially if other channels are monitored.
4. Given the context, using an IRC channel aligns with the capabilities of malware like Shellbot and the goal of establishing a covert C&C channel.

**Final Answer**: A
