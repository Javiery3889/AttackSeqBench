To answer this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involved.

1. **Analyze the Question**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker, presumably Agrius, uses the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for Command and Control (C2) communication over HTTP. This backdoor is utilized for various malicious activities such as updating relays or downloading files. The question then inquires about the likelihood of Agrius deploying wipers (like 'Apostle') that later function as ransomware to destroy data on targeted systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs**:
   - Initial access and establishment of C2 communication using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - Utilization of the backdoor for downloading files and updating relays, indicating further malicious activity post-initial access.
   - Potential deployment of wipers (specifically 'Apostle') that evolve into functioning ransomware for data destruction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate**:
   - The use of a backdoor for C2 communication and downloading files suggests an intent to maintain access and possibly escalate privileges within a targeted network.
   - The deployment of wipers or ransomware would align with an intent to cause damage or extort the victim, which could be a logical next step after establishing control and potentially exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - The evolution of 'Apostle' from a wiper to functioning ransomware indicates an adaptive approach by the attackers, potentially in response to the victim's security posture or the attackers' changing objectives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Establishment of Malicious Presence**: The initial use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor indicates a successful breach and the establishment of a malicious presence within the target network.
   - **Escalation and Data Exfiltration**: The actions of updating relays and downloading files suggest efforts to either expand control or prepare for further malicious activities, such as data exfiltration.
   - **Destruction of Data**: Deploying wipers or ransomware would be a logical next step to either destroy evidence, disrupt operations, or extort the victim, especially if the attackers have already achieved their primary objectives (e.g., data exfiltration).

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the sequence of TTPs described, it is plausible that after establishing a foothold and potentially exfiltrating data, an attacker like Agrius could deploy wipers or ransomware to destroy data or extort the victim. This aligns with observed behaviors in sophisticated cyber attacks where multiple stages of attack are executed to achieve different objectives.
