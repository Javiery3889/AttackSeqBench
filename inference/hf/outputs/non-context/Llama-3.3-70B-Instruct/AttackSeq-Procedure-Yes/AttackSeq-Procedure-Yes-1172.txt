To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Conducting Vulnerability Scanning**: This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where attackers use tools to scan for vulnerabilities in systems or services that can be exploited. This aligns with the "Reconnaissance" phase and specifically the "Active Scanning" technique (T1595) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Deploying Public Exploits on Identified Vulnerable Services**: After identifying vulnerabilities, attackers often use publicly available exploits to gain initial access to a system. This action corresponds to the "Exploitation of Remote Services" technique (T1210) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Using public exploits is a common approach because it leverages existing tools and knowledge, making it efficient for attackers.

3. **Using Stolen Credentials to Maintain Persistent Access**: Once initial access is gained, attackers often seek to establish persistence. Using stolen credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) is a method to maintain access without relying on the initial exploit, which might be patched. This aligns with the "Credential Access" (TA0006) and "Persistence" (TA0003) tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically techniques like "Credentials in Files" (T1552) or "Unsecured Credentials" (T1552), and "Valid Accounts" (T1078) for persistence.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
- **Initial Access** through exploitation of vulnerabilities,
- Followed by **Persistence** using stolen credentials to maintain access.

Therefore, it is indeed likely that after identifying vulnerabilities through scanning, a threat group would attempt to exploit those vulnerabilities to gain access and then use stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.
