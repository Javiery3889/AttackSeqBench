To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in a typical cyber attack sequence, especially focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to the initial stages of an attack as described.

1. **Active Discovery for Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering**: This step involves the adversary actively engaging with the target's network or systems to gather information. This could include network scanning, probing for open ports, or even social engineering attempts to gather more detailed information about the target's security posture, network layout, and potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Initiating a Phishing Campaign**: Phishing is a common technique used by adversaries to gain initial access to a network. It involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials or into executing malicious code on their systems. This technique is often used after the initial reconnaissance phase because it leverages the information gathered during reconnaissance to craft more targeted and effective phishing emails.

3. **Establishing a Command and Control (C2) Connection**: After gaining initial access, establishing a C2 connection is crucial for the adversary to maintain control over the compromised system, steal data, or move laterally within the network. This typically involves installing malware that communicates back to the adversary's C2 servers.

Given these steps, the sequence described in the question seems plausible:
- **Reconnaissance** helps identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.
- **Phishing** can be used as a method to gain **Initial Access** (TA0001 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework), leveraging the information gathered during reconnaissance to increase the chances of success.
- **Establishing a C2 Connection** would logically follow after initial access is gained, as it allows the adversary to execute further actions on the compromised system.

Therefore, considering the typical attack sequence and the TTPs involved, it is indeed likely that adversaries would initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors as a means to gain initial access before establishing a command and control connection through malware on the targeted network.
