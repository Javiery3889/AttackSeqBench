To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of such a sequence based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The first step mentioned involves using Microsoft Word to send a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software. This technique can be associated with the "Reconnaissance" phase of an attack, where attackers gather information about their target. Specifically, this could relate to the "Active Scanning" technique (T1190) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where an adversary engages in scanning and reconnaissance activities to gather information about the target environment.

2. **Spear Phishing**: The next step involves using spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links as a means to gain initial access. This aligns with the "Phishing" technique (T1566) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers send tailored emails to specific targets, attempting to trick them into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions that aid the attack. The use of OLE2 format documents with embedded links could be a method to deliver malware or to execute malicious code on the victim's system, potentially leading to initial access.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the likelihood of this sequence:

- **Reconnaissance** to gather information about the target's software environment can indeed precede a targeted attack like **spear phishing**. Understanding the target's software can help attackers craft more effective phishing emails or select the right exploit.
- **Spear phishing** with malicious documents is a common method for gaining initial access to a system. The use of OLE2 format documents with embedded links could serve as a vector for delivering malware or exploiting vulnerabilities, aligning with techniques like "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1566.001) or "Spearphishing Link" (T1566.002) under the Phishing technique.

Considering these points, the sequence described in the question—using reconnaissance to inform the crafting of spear phishing emails that utilize OLE2 format documents with embedded links for initial access—forms a plausible attack sequence. This aligns with known TTPs used by sophisticated attackers to tailor their attacks for higher success rates.
