To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the likelihood of the described sequence of actions.

1. **Initial Steps**: The adversary starts by using PsLogList for account discovery. PsLogList is a tool that can be used to enumerate logon sessions and extract information about users who have logged on to a system. This is often used in the context of gathering information about potential targets for further exploitation.

2. **Exporting Windows Security Event Logs**: The adversary then exports Windows Security Event Logs. These logs can contain a wealth of information, including login attempts, account changes, and other security-related events. This action suggests the adversary is looking to gather more detailed information about system activity and possibly identify vulnerabilities or patterns that can be exploited.

3. **Executing Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz**: Mimikatz is a tool used to extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN codes, and kerberos tickets from memory. By executing Mimikatz, the adversary aims to obtain credentials that can be used for further access or lateral movement within the network.

Given these initial steps, the question is whether it is likely that the adversary will then move laterally to a domain controller using SMB (Server Message Block), PsExec, or WinRM (Windows Remote Management).

- **SMB** is a protocol that can be used for lateral movement, especially if the adversary has obtained credentials that allow access to shared resources.
- **PsExec** is a tool that allows for the execution of processes on remote systems, which is a common method for lateral movement if credentials have been compromised.
- **WinRM** is a management protocol that allows remote access to Windows systems, which can also be used for lateral movement.

Considering the actions taken by the adversary:
- They have already demonstrated an interest in account discovery and credential dumping.
- They have the capability (through Mimikatz) to obtain credentials that could grant access to other systems on the network.
- Lateral movement to a domain controller would be a logical next step to escalate privileges, gather more information, or spread malware.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The adversary has shown intent to discover and exploit account information.
2. They have used tools capable of extracting credentials.
3. Lateral movement to a domain controller would be a strategic next step for further exploitation or to achieve specific goals like domain dominance.

**Conclusion**: Given the sequence of actions and the tools used, it is highly plausible that the adversary would attempt to move laterally to a domain controller using SMB, PsExec, or WinRM after obtaining credentials.
