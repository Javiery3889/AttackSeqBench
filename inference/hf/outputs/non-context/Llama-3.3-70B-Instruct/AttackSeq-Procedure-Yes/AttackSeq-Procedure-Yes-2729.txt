To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the behavior of the Lazarus group based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with this threat actor.

1. **Analyzing the Question**: The question outlines a sequence of actions starting with the execution of the Responder tool to gain credential access. Following this, it queries whether the Lazarus group would likely engage in system service discovery before proceeding with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) to establish network connections and copy malware.

2. **Identifying TTPs**:
   - **Credential Access**: The use of the Responder tool to acquire login credentials.
   - **Discovery**: System service discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Using Windows commands and WMIC to move laterally within the network, establish connections, and copy malware to remote hosts.

3. **Comparing and Evaluating**:
   - The Lazarus group, known for sophisticated cyber attacks, often employs a range of TTPs to achieve their objectives. After gaining initial access and credential access, it is common for threat actors to conduct discovery activities. This includes system service discovery to understand the network layout, identify potential targets, and plan further actions such as lateral movement.
   - System service discovery (T1046) provides valuable information about the services running on the system, which can be crucial for planning the next steps, such as identifying services that could be exploited for lateral movement or determining how to maintain persistence.
   - The use of Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement is consistent with known TTPs of various threat actors, including the Lazarus group, as it allows for the execution of commands on remote systems, which can include copying malware to remote hosts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - **Step 1**: The Lazarus group uses the Responder tool to gain credential access, which aligns with their known TTPs of exploiting vulnerabilities and using tools for initial access and credential harvesting.
   - **Step 2**: After gaining credential access, conducting system service discovery would be a logical next step to gather information about the network and potential vulnerabilities or services that could be leveraged for further movement.
   - **Step 3**: Using the information gathered, the group could then use Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement, which is a common approach for threat actors aiming to spread within a network and achieve their objectives, such as deploying additional malware.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the typical behavior of sophisticated threat actors like the Lazarus group, it is reasonable to assume that after gaining credential access, they would conduct discovery activities such as system service discovery to inform their lateral movement efforts. This approach aligns with the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the categories of Credential Access, Discovery, and Lateral Movement.
