To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved and analyze the likelihood of the scenario described:

1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains initial access to the system by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. This is a common initial access technique (TTP) used by attackers to gain a foothold in a target network.

2. **Execution**: After gaining access, the attacker runs cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor. SparrowDoor is a known malware tool, and executing it via cmd.exe is a method of achieving execution (another TTP) on the compromised system. This step indicates the attacker is moving laterally or establishing a presence within the network.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: The question then asks about the likelihood of SparrowDoor communicating with its Command and Control (C&C) server via an encrypted HTTPS channel. Command and Control is a critical phase in the attack lifecycle where the attacker maintains communication with the compromised system to issue commands, exfiltrate data, or move laterally within the network.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: It is common for modern malware, including tools like SparrowDoor, to use encrypted channels for C2 communications. Using HTTPS for C2 communications provides several advantages to the attacker, including blending in with normal network traffic (since HTTPS is widely used for legitimate purposes) and encrypting the communication to evade detection by network monitoring tools. This makes the malicious traffic harder to distinguish from legitimate traffic.

- **B: No**: While it's possible for malware to use unencrypted or other types of communication channels, the use of encrypted HTTPS for C2 is a prevalent tactic among attackers due to its effectiveness in evading detection.

Considering the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and the common behaviors of malware like SparrowDoor, the most plausible sequence of events is that after gaining access and executing the malware, it would indeed attempt to communicate with its C&C server via an encrypted channel like HTTPS to maintain stealth and continue its operations without being detected.

Final Answer: A
