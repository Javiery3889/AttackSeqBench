To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in the attack sequence described and evaluate the likelihood of the Naikon APT group following this sequence based on common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in cyber attacks.

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The use of the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key for establishing persistence is a common technique among attackers. This method ensures that malware or a backdoor is executed every time the system boots up or a user logs in, respectively. This is a plausible first step for any APT group, including Naikon, aiming to maintain access to a compromised system.

2. **Executing Aria-body Loader's Tasks**: The tasks mentioned, such as injecting into processes, decrypting configuration data, and contacting Command and Control (C&C) servers, are typical actions taken by malware or backdoors after establishing a foothold in a system. These actions are necessary for the malware to operate effectively, communicate with its operators, and potentially download additional payloads.

3. **Gathering Network-Related Information**: Gathering information about the network, such as TCP and UDP table status, is a common reconnaissance step. However, this action can occur at various stages of an attack. It could happen early on to understand the network layout and identify potential targets or later to prepare for lateral movement or exfiltration.

Given these considerations, the sequence described in the question seems plausible from a tactical standpoint. Establishing persistence and executing the malware's primary functions (like contacting C&C servers and preparing for further operations) would logically precede or occur concurrently with gathering detailed network information. The latter is often part of the reconnaissance phase, which can be ongoing throughout the attack but is particularly relevant after the attacker has secured a stable presence within the network.

Therefore, considering the typical flow of a cyber attack and the goals of APT groups like Naikon, it is reasonable to conclude that they might follow such a sequence to ensure they have a solid foothold before proceeding with deeper reconnaissance and potential further exploitation.
