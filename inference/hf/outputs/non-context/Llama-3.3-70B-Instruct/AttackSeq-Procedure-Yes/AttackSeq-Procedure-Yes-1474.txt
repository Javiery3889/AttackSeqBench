To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved in evaluating the likelihood of the scenario described:

1. **Understanding the SLUB Backdoor**: The SLUB backdoor is a type of malware designed to provide unauthorized access to a compromised system. Its capabilities, as mentioned, include collecting sensitive information such as screenshots, file listings, and archives of the user's Desktop folder. This suggests the malware is designed for espionage or reconnaissance purposes.

2. **Communication Methods for Command and Control (C2)**: Malware often communicates with its command and control servers to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data. The use of the Slack API to post messages and command results to a private Slack channel is an unconventional but plausible method for C2 communication. Slack, being a legitimate communication platform, can be exploited for malicious purposes due to its features that allow for automated posting and messaging through its API.

3. **Evaluating the Plausibility**: 
   - The SLUB backdoor's ability to collect specific types of data indicates a level of sophistication and customization, suggesting its operators are capable of implementing non-standard communication methods.
   - Using a legitimate service like Slack for C2 communication can provide a level of cover for malicious activities, as network traffic to and from Slack might not be as heavily scrutinized as traffic to known malicious IP addresses or unusual ports.
   - The use of a private Slack channel for these purposes would require the attackers to have access to a Slack workspace and the ability to create or use an existing private channel, which is within the realm of possibility for sophisticated threat actors.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the capabilities of the SLUB backdoor and the potential benefits of using a legitimate platform like Slack for covert communication, it is indeed plausible that the malware could communicate with attackers using the Slack API for command and control purposes.
