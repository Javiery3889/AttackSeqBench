Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK tactic was used before the malicious Word document created persistence through a batch file and a registry entry. The question mentions that the Word document used Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute PowerShell commands. 

First, I need to recall what each of these terms means. The ATT&CK framework breaks down cyber attack techniques into tactics. The options given are Lateral Movement, Execution, Impact, and Initial Access.

The question is about the sequence of tactics leading up to the creation of persistence mechanisms like batch files and registry entries. So, the initial step would be how the attacker gained access to the system. That's probably Initial Access, which is option D. 

But wait, the question is specifically about the use of DDE in Office documents. I remember that DDE is a feature in Office that allows embedding objects, like OLE objects, which can execute code. So, when a document is opened, it can trigger a remote command execution. This is often used in attacks where the document is the initial vector, like a Phishing email attachment.

So, the initial access would involve the document being opened, which would execute some code. That execution is part of the Execution tactic, which is option B. So, the initial access is D, but the specific tactic used to execute the malicious code is Execution.

Wait, but the question is asking which tactic was involved in using DDE to execute PowerShell commands. So, the act of using DDE to run PowerShell commands would be part of the Execution phase. So, the correct answer is B: Execution.
</think>

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic was used when a malicious Word document employed DDE to execute PowerShell commands. DDE is a method used in Office documents to run code, which falls under the Execution tactic. This tactic is about how the malicious code is run, not the initial access. 

Final Answer: B: Execution
