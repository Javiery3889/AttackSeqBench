Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK tactic comes after APT15 deploys the RoyalDNS backdoor. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT15 is a known threat group, and RoyalDNS is a backdoor they use. The question says RoyalDNS installs persistently on the network and uses DNS to communicate. So, the initial action is the deployment of this backdoor.

Now, I need to think about what happens after a backdoor is installed. Backdoors are typically used for persistence, right? They allow attackers to maintain access to the system, so the next logical step would be to ensure that the backdoor remains active even after reboots or other interruptions. So, that points towards the Persistence tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Looking at the answer choices: A is Persistence, B is Resource Development, C is Privilege Escalation, and D is Exfiltration. 

Wait, but sometimes after establishing persistence, attackers might move laterally within the network. But the question is specifically about what comes after the backdoor is installed. So, the immediate next step would be to make sure the backdoor stays active, which is Persistence. 

I don't think it's Privilege Escalation because that usually comes after initial access. Exfiltration is data extraction, which might come later too. Resource Development is more about creating tools, which could be part of the initial phase but not the immediate next step after installing a backdoor.

So, putting it all together, the most likely next step is Persistence.

The most plausible sequence after deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor would be to ensure its persistence on the network, as it's a common tactic to maintain access. Therefore, the next step aligns with the Persistence tactic.

Final Answer: A: Persistence
