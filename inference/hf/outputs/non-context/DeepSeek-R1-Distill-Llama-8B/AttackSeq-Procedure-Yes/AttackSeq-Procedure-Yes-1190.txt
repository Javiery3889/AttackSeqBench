Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the RMS tool used by attackers for reconnaissance and lateral movement within a network would attempt to communicate with a C2 server in Germany using application layer protocols. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that RMS stands for Remote Monitoring and Management System, which is often used by organizations for IT infrastructure management. Attackers might use such tools to gain access to a network, possibly through compromised credentials or other means. Once they have access, they can perform lateral movement within the network, which means moving from one compromised host to another, maybe using tools like Mimikatz or other credential dumping tools.

Now, the question is about whether the RMS tool would communicate with a C2 server in Germany. C2 stands for Command and Control, which is a common tactic used by attackers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Application layer protocols are things like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc., which are used for communication over a network.

I'm thinking about how RMS tools typically operate. They usually communicate over standard protocols. If the RMS tool is used for management, it might use protocols like SSH, Telnet, or HTTPs for communication. If the C2 is in Germany, the tool might use these protocols to send data back to the attacker's server there.

But wait, the question is specifically about whether it's "likely" that RMS would do this. I'm not entirely sure if RMS is commonly used for C2 communication. I recall that some tools like Cobalt Strike use different protocols, but RMS is more about monitoring. Maybe the attacker could use it for exfiltration, but is that the primary function?

Alternatively, maybe the attacker uses a different tool for C2 communication, like a custom one that uses specific protocols. So perhaps the RMS tool itself isn't the one handling the C2 communication but is used for initial access and lateral movement. Therefore, the communication with the C2 server might be done via a separate tool or protocol not directly tied to RMS.

So, putting it all together, while RMS might be used for some communication, it's not the primary tool for C2. Therefore, it's less likely that RMS would be the one communicating with a C2 server in Germany using application layer protocols.

The RMS tool is primarily used for remote monitoring and management, not typically for C2 communication. While it might use application layer protocols for some functions, it's more likely that a separate tool would handle C2 activities. Therefore, it's less probable that RMS would directly communicate with a C2 server in Germany.

Final Answer: B: No
