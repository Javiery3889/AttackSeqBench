Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload after the initial access via the Sharpshooter downloader. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the initial attack involved injecting a malicious macro into a Word document, which uses the Sharpshooter downloader. Sharpshooter is a tool I've heard about before; I think it's used for accessing systems and delivering payloads. So, the initial step is that the macro injects this downloader into the memory of the Word document. When the document is opened, the macro runs and the Sharpshooter accesses the system.

Now, the question is about whether Rising Sun is the next step. I'm not too familiar with Rising Sun, but I remember that it's another tool used in cyberattacks. From what I recall, Rising Sun is often used as a second-stage payload. It's designed to be a persistent implant that can perform various malicious activities, like keylogging, credential dumping, or lateral movement across the network.

So, the initial access is through Sharpshooter, which probably drops a payload that's the first stage. Then, Rising Sun would be the second stage, which is executed after the initial access. This makes sense because the second-stage payload is typically more sophisticated and has more capabilities than the first-stage tool.

I think the sequence here is that Sharpshooter is the initial access vector, and Rising Sun is the implant that gets activated afterward. So, yes, it's likely that Rising Sun would be downloaded and executed to perform further malicious activities.

The initial attack uses Sharpshooter to gain access, and Rising Sun is a known second-stage payload used for persistence and malicious actions. Therefore, it's likely that Rising Sun will be downloaded after the initial access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
