Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Gamaredon, after using their Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments, will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand what Gamaredon does. From what I remember, Gamaredon is a threat group known for their attacks on organizations, often targeting email systems. They use various tactics, including phishing, credential dumping, and lateral movement. Their VBA macros are used to spread malware, which allows them to move across a network once they've compromised one initial target.

So, the question is about what they do next after moving laterally. The attack sequence mentioned is: using Outlook VBA macro for initial lateral movement via email with malicious attachments. Now, after that, would they deploy scripts to scan for sensitive documents?

I think about the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The ATT&CK tactics include things like Initial Access, which in this case is the VBA macro email. Then, after gaining access, they might move laterally, which they've done. Now, what comes next? They might be looking to collect data, so they might use scripts to search for specific files or data on the network.

I recall that some groups use tools like Mimikatz for credential dumping, but that's more about extracting credentials. However, for document collection, maybe they use something like a script that searches for certain file types or patterns. Alternatively, they might use tools that search for specific data in directories or use search queries to find sensitive information.

So, after moving laterally, it's plausible that Gamaredon would deploy scripts to search for sensitive documents. This would fit into the collection phase of their activities, where they gather as much data as possible to find valuable information for further attacks or for selling on the dark web.

I'm not entirely sure if it's a script or if they might use built-in tools, but the question specifies scripts, so I think it's more about automated scanning. Therefore, the answer should be Yes, they would deploy such scripts.

The group Gamaredon, after using Outlook VBA macros for initial lateral movement, is likely to deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their data collection efforts. This aligns with their typical behavior of gathering information to facilitate further attacks or monetization.

Final Answer: A: Yes
