Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware would use InstallUtil.exe to evade detection by bypassing SmartScreen and AppLocker. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that InstallUtil.exe is a legitimate Windows utility used by system administrators to install .msi files. Malware authors often abuse this tool because it has high privileges and can execute scripts or install software without user interaction, which is a classic evasion technique.

The question mentions that the malware has already created a scheduled task with appropriate privileges. Scheduled tasks in Windows can run with higher privileges, which is a good way to ensure persistence. So, the malware is likely using a scheduled task to run at a certain time, maybe even when the user isn't active, making it harder to detect.

Now, considering the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) involved here. The question is about defense evasion, specifically bypassing Smartscreen and AppLocker. InstallUtil.exe is known to be used for defense evasion because it can bypass some of these tools. When InstallUtil.exe runs, it can execute scripts or install software with elevated privileges, which might not be detected by certain security tools like Smartscreen or AppLocker if they're not configured to monitor this specific executable or the specific behavior.

I remember that some antivirus tools might not detect InstallUtil.exe as malicious because it's a legitimate tool, but in this case, the malware is malicious, so it's being used to its full potential. The scheduled task would run InstallUtil.exe, which could execute malicious scripts or payloads that are not typically monitored by these tools, thus evading detection.

So, putting it all together, the malware uses a scheduled task to run InstallUtil.exe, which helps it bypass Smartscreen and AppLocker. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely to use InstallUtil.exe for this purpose.

The malware uses a scheduled task to run InstallUtil.exe, which is a legitimate tool but can be abused for defense evasion by bypassing Smartscreen and AppLocker. This makes the answer:

Final Answer: A: Yes
