Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the group Blind Eagle will use PowerShell to load DLLs and bypass AMSI before placing a VBScript in the Startup folder. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial access method is through a JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord. That means the initial attack vector is via a script delivered via Discord. So, the initial access is via a script, which is common for many cyberattacks.

Now, after gaining access, the next step is to figure out what the attackers might do next. The question is specifically about whether they'll use PowerShell to load DLLs and bypass AMSI, and then place a VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence.

I know that AMSI, or Anti-Malware Scan Interface, is a feature in Windows that allows antivirus software to scan scripts in real-time. Bypassing AMSI would allow the attackers to execute malicious code that might otherwise be blocked by antivirus tools. So, if the group wants to ensure persistence or execute malicious code without being detected, they might try to bypass AMSI.

PowerShell is a common tool for such tasks because it's widely used and has a lot of capabilities, including the ability to load DLLs. So, using PowerShell to load a malicious DLL makes sense as a way to execute code that might be otherwise blocked.

After bypassing AMSI, the group would likely want to ensure that their malicious code runs on every system startup. Placing a VBScript in the Startup folder is a classic method for persistence because VBScript is a known script language that runs at startup. When the user logs on, the VBScript would execute, possibly dropping further malicious payloads or maintaining access.

So, putting it all together, the sequence would be: initial access via JavaScript, then using PowerShell to bypass AMSI by loading a DLL, and finally placing a VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence. This seems like a logical progression for an attacker looking to establish a persistent presence on a system.

I don't see any immediate red flags or reasons why this sequence wouldn't make sense. It aligns with common tactics used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) to ensure their presence on a compromised system.

The sequence described aligns with common tactics used by cyber threat actors. After initial access via a JavaScript downloader, using PowerShell to bypass AMSI and then placing a VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence is a plausible next step. This approach allows for both evading detection and ensuring sustained access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
