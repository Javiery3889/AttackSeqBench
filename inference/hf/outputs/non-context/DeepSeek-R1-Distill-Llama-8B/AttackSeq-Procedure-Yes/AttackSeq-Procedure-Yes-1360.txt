Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sakula malware will communicate with specific domains like inocnation.com or oa.ameteksen.com after exploiting CVE-2015-5119. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that CVE-2015-5119 refers to a vulnerability in the Microsoft Silverlight component. Exploiting this allows an attacker to execute a malicious payload, which in this case is a first stage downloader. This downloader retrieves the second stage, which is the PlugX malware. PlugX is known for its capability to connect to various command and control (C2) domains.

The question mentions that the initial attack uses CVE-2015-5119 to execute a downloader that gets PlugX and connects to cdn.sanecat.com. Now, I need to determine if Sakula, which I believe is another name for PlugX, will communicate with inocnation.com or oa.ameteksen.com.

I recall that PlugX, also known as Sakula, is a modular malware that can communicate over different protocols. It's known to use domains for C2 communication, and these domains can vary. However, without specific information about the particular version or configuration of PlugX used, it's hard to say definitively.

I should consider whether these specific domains are known to be associated with PlugX. I don't have specific knowledge that links inocnation.com or oa.ameteksen.com directly to PlugX. It's possible that these domains are used by other malware or unrelated actors. Alternatively, they might be used in a different context.

Another angle is to think about how PlugX operates. It's a multi-stage malware that can use various protocols like HTTP or HTTPS, and it can communicate through different C2 servers. The choice of domain depends on the specific configuration of the malware. So, without knowing the exact configuration, it's uncertain.

I should also consider if there's any known association between PlugX and these domains. If I look up recent intelligence, I might find that these domains aren't commonly associated with PlugX. Therefore, it's plausible that the answer is no, but I can't be 100% certain without more information.

Wait, but the question is about whether it's "likely." Since PlugX is flexible, it's possible that it could use these domains, but without specific evidence, it's not a sure thing. So, the answer might lean towards no, it's not likely.

The analysis indicates that while PlugX (Sakula) can use various C2 domains, there's no specific evidence linking it to inocnation.com or oa.ameteksen.com. Therefore, it's unlikely that these domains are used in this context.

Final Answer: B: No
