Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether NetTraveler malware would use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing its C&C servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware has already established persistence by registering a main C&C module called "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL" as a service named "Windowsupdata". It also uses mutexes like "SD_2013 Is Running!" to prevent multiple instances from running. So, the malware is already taking steps to ensure it stays on the system.

Now, the question is about whether it would use a simple encryption for its configuration before revealing the C&C servers. I remember that malware often uses encryption to protect their communication with command and control servers. This makes sense because if the configuration is encrypted, it can be harder for defenders to intercept or analyze.

NetTraveler is known to be a banking Trojan, which typically uses encryption to protect sensitive data. They might use symmetric encryption, like AES, or asymmetric encryption with public and private keys. The use of a simple encryption scheme could help in obfuscating the C&C addresses, making it harder for researchers or security teams to trace the traffic.

Looking at the answer choices, A says "Yes" and B says "No". Since the question is about whether it's likely, I think the answer is probably "Yes" because encryption is a common tactic for malware to protect their communications. The fact that they've already taken steps for persistence suggests they are cautious about their operations, so using encryption for C&C communication would make sense.

I don't see any reasons to think it wouldn't use encryption. It's a standard practice, so the answer should be A.

The malware's use of persistence and anti-debugging techniques suggests it values operational security. Encrypting its configuration before revealing C&C servers is a common practice to protect sensitive data and evade detection. Therefore, it's likely they would use a simple encryption scheme.

Final Answer: A: Yes
