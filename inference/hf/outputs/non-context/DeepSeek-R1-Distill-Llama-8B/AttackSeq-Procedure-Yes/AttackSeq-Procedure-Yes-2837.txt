Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in question will use HTTPS for its command and control operations after it's discovered system information using 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that 'tasklist' is a command-line utility in Windows that lists all running processes, and 'systeminfo' provides detailed system information. So, the malware is gathering process and system data. This makes sense as initial steps in reconnaissance, probably for lateral movement or understanding the environment.

Now, the question is about whether HTTPS will be used in the next step of command and control (C2). I remember that HTTPS is a secure protocol, often used by attackers to avoid detection. But I also recall that some malware might prefer HTTP instead, especially if it's in its early stages or if it's not fully encrypted yet.

I think about how malware communicates. Sometimes, especially in the initial stages, they might use plaintext HTTP because it's simpler and faster. But as they become more sophisticated, they switch to HTTPS to hide their communications. However, the initial discovery phase might not necessarily require HTTPS. The malware might just need basic info, so using plain HTTP could be sufficient and less resource-intensive.

Also, using HTTPS requires the attacker to set up a certificate or find a public one, which might be a step they might not take right away. So, it's plausible that the malware would stick with HTTP for the next step.

The malware is likely to use HTTP rather than HTTPS for its next command and control communication. Since it's in the initial phase of gathering information, using HTTP is simpler and doesn't require the overhead of HTTPS encryption. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
