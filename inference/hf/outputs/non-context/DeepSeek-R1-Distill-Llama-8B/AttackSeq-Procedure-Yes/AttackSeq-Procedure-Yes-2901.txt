Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT15 would deploy backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS after using Mimikatz to get domain admin credentials and a VPN certificate. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT15 is a group known for their advanced persistent threats. They often use tools like Mimikatz to perform credential dumping. Mimikatz is used to extract credentials from memory, so once they have domain admin credentials, they can access a lot of sensitive information.

With those credentials, they can access the network using a VPN, which makes sense because a VPN can help them avoid detection by masking their IP address. Now, the question is about whether they would deploy specific backdoors. The backdoors mentioned are BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

I remember that RoyalCLI is a tool that allows operators to execute commands as if they're coming from a legitimate process, which can bypass some security policies. RoyalDNS is another tool that can manipulate DNS queries, possibly for exfiltration or to gain persistence. BS2005 is a backdoor that's known to be used by APT15, so it's likely they would use it for remote access.

So, after getting the credentials and VPN access, deploying these backdoors would make sense. RoyalCLI could help them bypass command prompt policies, making it easier to execute malicious activities without being noticed. RoyalDNS might be used to create a persistent DNS tunnel or manipulate DNS queries to exfiltrate data or communicate with their command and control servers. BS2005 would provide a backdoor for further access and movement within the network.

Putting it all together, it's plausible that APT15 would deploy these tools to enhance their access and evade detection. So the answer should be yes.

The sequence of TTPs described aligns with the behavior of APT15, who typically deploys such tools to establish persistence and bypass security measures after obtaining access. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
