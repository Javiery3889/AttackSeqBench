Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the WastedLocker ransomware will encrypt computers and servers after being deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender during the defense evasion phase. The question is asking if this leads to significant disruption and a multimillion-dollar ransom in the impact phase. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to recall what I know about WastedLocker. I remember that WastedLocker is a ransomware that's known for targeting Windows systems, especially older versions like Windows 7 and 8. It's a file-encrypting ransomware, which means it encrypts files on the victim's system and then demands payment for the decryption key.

The question mentions that the ransomware is deployed using PsExec. PsExec is a tool from the Windows Sysinternals suite, used for executing processes with higher privileges. So, using PsExec would allow the ransomware to run with elevated privileges, which is a common technique for defense evasion because it helps the malware avoid detection and gain access to more resources.

In the defense evasion phase, the ransomware stops services and disables Windows Defender. This makes sense because disabling security tools can help the ransomware operate undetected. Stopping services might be to prevent any automated responses or to ensure that certain processes don't interfere with the ransomware's operations.

Now, the question is whether this leads to encryption in the impact phase. I think that once the ransomware is on the system, its primary goal is to encrypt files. So, after evading detection and gaining access, the next step would be to encrypt the data. This encryption would cause significant disruption because the victim can't access their files until they pay the ransom.

I also remember that WastedLocker is known for encrypting files, so it's likely that after the initial phase of evading detection, it proceeds to encrypt the data. The impact phase would involve the encryption, leading to data loss and the demand for payment. Since the ransomware is designed to cause disruption, it's plausible that it would encrypt the systems, leading to a significant impact.

So, putting it all together, using PsExec for deployment, stopping services, and disabling Windows Defender during defense evasion would set the stage for the ransomware to encrypt the systems in the impact phase. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The WastedLocker ransomware, after using PsExec for deployment and evading detection by stopping services and disabling Windows Defender, is likely to proceed to the impact phase where it encrypts the victim's data. This encryption would cause significant disruption and lead to a multimillion-dollar ransom demand.

Final Answer: A: Yes
