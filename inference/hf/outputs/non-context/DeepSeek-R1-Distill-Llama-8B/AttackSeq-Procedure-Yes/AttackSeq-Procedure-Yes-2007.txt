Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the adversaries would establish a C2 connection via a malicious VBA script after delivering the BlackEnergy 3 RAT through a phishing campaign. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that BlackEnergy 3 is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), which means it's designed to give attackers remote access to compromised systems. Phishing campaigns are often used to distribute such malware because they trick users into downloading malicious files, like VBA scripts, which are commonly used in email attachments or document files.

So, the question is about whether the next step after delivering the RAT would involve using a malicious VBA script to connect back to a command and control (C2) server. I remember that VBA scripts are often used in Office documents because they can execute code when the document is opened. Since the RAT is already on the system, it's likely that it would use some mechanism to communicate back to its C2 server.

I think about how RATs typically operate. Once a RAT is installed, it needs to establish communication with its C2 server to receive commands and send data. This communication is usually done through encrypted channels to avoid detection. Malicious VBA scripts can be a common way to execute such communication because they can be embedded in documents and execute automatically when opened.

So, putting it together, after delivering the BlackEnergy 3 RAT via phishing, it's highly probable that the adversaries would use a malicious VBA script to establish a C2 connection. This makes sense because VBA scripts are a known vector for RATs to communicate with their C2 servers.

The adversaries are likely to establish a C2 connection using a malicious VBA script after delivering the BlackEnergy 3 RAT through a phishing campaign. This is a common method for RATs to communicate with their command and control servers, allowing further malicious activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
