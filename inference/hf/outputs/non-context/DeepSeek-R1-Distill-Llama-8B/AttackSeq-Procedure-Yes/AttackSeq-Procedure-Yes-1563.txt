Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation after being delivered through a supply-chain attack on SolarWinds. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Sunburst is a backdoor that was used in the 2021 SolarWinds attack. It was delivered through a supply chain attack, which means it was embedded into legitimate software updates, probably without the knowledge of the software vendor. Once it's installed, the backdoor would establish communication with its command and control (C2) server to receive further instructions from the attackers.

I remember that backdoors like Sunburst are designed to give attackers persistent access to a system. So, after the initial compromise, the backdoor would need to communicate with the attacker's server to receive commands or instructions. This communication is typically done using some form of protocol. Protocols are the rules or methods used for data transmission, so the backdoor would use a specific protocol to send and receive data.

I'm thinking about what kind of protocols are commonly used in such attacks. I know that HTTP and HTTPS are common because they're widely used for communication over the internet. Since the backdoor is likely designed to be stealthy, it might use encrypted communication to avoid detection. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, so that makes sense because it uses encryption, which makes it harder to intercept.

Another possibility could be using something like DNS over HTTPS (DoH), but I'm not sure if Sunburst specifically uses that. I think more commonly, backdoors use standard HTTP or HTTPS for their C2 communication because they're widely supported and easy to implement. Also, using a protocol like HTTP would allow the backdoor to send small amounts of data, which is useful for commands and instructions.

I don't recall Sunburst using something like DNS or other protocols like SMB or FTP, which are less likely because those are more associated with other types of attacks or older systems. The Sunburst backdoor was part of a sophisticated attack, so it's more likely to use a common but secure method like HTTPS to communicate without drawing too much attention.

So, putting it all together, after the backdoor is installed, it's highly probable that it would use a protocol like HTTPS to communicate with its C2 server for further exploitation activities. This would allow it to send and receive data securely, avoiding detection by most security tools that might be looking for more well-known protocols.

The Sunburst backdoor, used in the SolarWinds attack, was designed to establish communication with its C2 server using a protocol. Given its nature as a sophisticated tool, it's likely to use HTTPS, a secure and widely used protocol, to ensure stealth and encryption during data transmission. This allows the backdoor to receive commands and instructions without being easily detected.

Final Answer: A: Yes
