Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a phishing campaign that uses emails with a malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file would execute VBS macros after initial access. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that phishing emails often serve as the initial vector for cyberattacks. The email might trick the user into opening an attached document, which in this case is a Microsoft Word file. So, the initial access is through the phishing email, which the user opens, leading to the malicious file being downloaded or accessed.

Now, the question is about whether this file would execute VBS macros. VBS scripts are typically embedded in documents, and when the document is opened, especially if macros are enabled, the script can execute. So, I need to think about how the 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file is structured.

I remember that some malicious documents, like those used in phishing or ransomware attacks, embed scripts that execute automatically when the document is opened. These scripts can do various things, like downloading additional malicious files, exploiting vulnerabilities, or triggering further actions. So, if the 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file is designed to be a phishing tool, it's plausible that it's set to run macros upon opening.

I should also consider the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The ATT&CK framework categorizes adversary tactics and techniques. Phishing is part of the Initial Access phase, where the attacker gains access to a system. The next step might involve persistence, which could involve macros in a document to ensure that the malicious code runs every time the document is opened. So, the VBS macros would act as a persistence mechanism or a trigger for further actions.

Another angle is the user's behavior. If the user opens the document, especially if they have macros enabled, the script would execute. So, the likelihood of this happening depends on whether the document is designed to run macros automatically without the user's interaction, which is common in some phishing campaigns.

I should also think about whether VBS macros are a common method for executing malicious code in such contexts. Yes, I've heard of many cases where macro-enabled documents are used to deliver malware or perform actions like downloading malicious files or activating keyloggers.

Putting it all together, the phishing email provides initial access by getting the user to open the document. The document then uses VBS macros to execute further actions, which could include downloading malicious payloads, activating webshells, or other malicious activities. Therefore, it's likely that the campaign would execute VBS macros after the initial access via the phishing email.

The phishing email provides initial access by tricking the user into opening the 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. This document is designed to execute VBS macros upon opening, which can lead to further malicious actions such as downloading additional payloads or exploiting vulnerabilities. This aligns with the Initial Access and possibly Persistence tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, making it likely that VBS macros will be executed.

Final Answer: A: Yes
