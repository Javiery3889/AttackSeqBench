Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Blind Eagle will use PowerShell scripts with obfuscation before placing a VBScript in the Startup folder after gaining initial access via a JavaScript downloader that uses ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that when an attacker gains initial access, they often have a series of steps they follow to establish persistence, escalate privileges, and carry out their objectives. In this case, the initial access is through a JavaScript downloader that uses ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands. So, the attacker has already dropped some malicious code onto the system.

Now, the question is about what comes next. The options are whether they'll use PowerShell scripts with obfuscation for defense evasion before placing a VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence. Let me think about the typical tactics used in such attacks.

I remember that after initial access, attackers often look to evade detection. Obfuscation techniques are common because they make it harder for security tools to identify malicious code. So, using obfuscation in PowerShell scripts makes sense as a defense evasion tactic. This would help the attacker's scripts avoid being picked up by antivirus or other monitoring tools.

Once they've evaded detection, the next step might be to ensure persistence. Placing a VBScript in the Startup folder is a classic method for persistence because when the system boots up, the VBScript will execute automatically, allowing the attacker to maintain access. This is a reliable way to ensure that the malicious code runs every time the system starts.

So, the sequence would be: initial access via the JavaScript downloader, then using PowerShell scripts with obfuscation to evade detection, and finally placing a VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence. That makes sense because each step is a logical follow-up to the previous one, addressing both evading detection and ensuring the attack's longevity.

I don't see any steps out of place here. Obfuscation is a common defense evasion technique, and using VBScript in the Startup folder is a standard persistence method. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely that Blind Eagle will do both.

The attacker first gains access using a JavaScript downloader that executes PowerShell commands via ActiveXObject. To avoid detection, they would employ obfuscation in their PowerShell scripts. Once undetected, they place a VBScript in the Startup folder for persistence upon system boot-up.

Final Answer: A: Yes
