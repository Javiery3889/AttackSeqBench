Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Derusbi malware uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and sends HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp after gathering system information and sending it via port 443. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Derusbi is a malware associated with the North Korea, part of the Lazarus Group. From what I remember, Lazarus is known for targeting financial institutions and using various tactics to exfiltrate data. They often use different methods to communicate with their command and control (C2) servers, which are typically located on the same network or through encrypted channels to avoid detection.

The question mentions that Derusbi gathers system information and sends it via port 443. Port 443 is typically used for HTTPS, which is a secure protocol. So, the initial communication is likely encrypted and not easily intercepted. But after that, the question is about whether it uses HTTP beaconing, which is a different protocol. HTTP is unencrypted and less secure, so using it for C2 might be risky unless it's obfuscated.

Obfuscation techniques are used to hide the true nature of the traffic, making it harder to detect. So, if Derusbi uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscation, it would make the traffic look like regular HTTP traffic, which could help avoid detection by security tools that might be looking for known malicious indicators.

The specific endpoint is /photos/photo.asp. I'm not entirely sure about this file path, but it might be a common one used in some applications, making it a good hiding spot for C2 traffic. Using a common endpoint can help blend in with normal traffic.

Putting this together, Derusbi might use HTTP beaconing over port 443 with obfuscation to communicate, especially if it's already using a secure port for initial data transmission. This could be a way to maintain anonymity and avoid detection while exfiltrating data or receiving commands.

I'm a bit uncertain about whether Derusbi specifically uses this method, but based on the behavior of similar malware from Lazarus, it seems plausible. They often use multiple tactics to stay undetected, so using a mix of secure and less secure communication methods makes sense.

The Derusbi malware, associated with the Lazarus Group, is known for its sophisticated tactics. It uses port 443 for initial secure communication but may switch to HTTP beaconing with obfuscation for C2 interactions. This dual approach helps in evading detection by blending with regular traffic, making /photos/photo.asp a likely endpoint for such communications.

Final Answer: A: Yes
