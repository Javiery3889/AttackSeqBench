Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Charming Kitten would use self-signed digital certificates after tricking victims with phishing pages. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question says that Charming Kitten uses phishing pages impersonating services like Google Drive and Yahoo to get victims' credentials. So, the initial step is that they're compromising user accounts through phishing. That makes sense because phishing is a common initial access method.

Now, after getting the credentials, what would they do next? The question is about whether they'd use self-signed certificates to subvert trust controls before redirecting to legitimate services for evasion. I remember that self-signed certificates are used to create a false sense of trust. They can be used to make malicious websites appear legitimate, which is useful for phishing or bypassing security measures.

So, if Charming Kitten wants to evade detection and avoid suspicion, they might use these self-signed certificates. They could issue these certificates to their victims, perhaps after the initial phishing success. This would make the victims more likely to trust the next step, which is redirecting them to a legitimate service. Maybe they're trying to make the attack look like a genuine login page or a legitimate site, so the victim doesn't notice anything suspicious.

I think this makes sense because using self-signed certificates can help in bypassing certain security protocols or warnings that might otherwise alert the user. For example, if a site is flagged as suspicious, the browser might show a warning. But with a self-signed certificate, even if the site is malicious, it might appear as a trusted one, especially if the certificate is issued by a trusted authority or if the victim's system trusts it.

Also, using self-signed certificates can help in maintaining persistence. Once the victim is redirected, the certificate could be used to authenticate the domain, making it harder for the victim to detect the phishing site as fake. This would aid in evading detection and analysis tools that might look for known phishing URLs or domains.

I don't see any immediate reasons why they wouldn't use self-signed certificates in this scenario. It seems like a common tactic for evading trust controls after an initial compromise. So, the answer should be yes, they would likely use self-signed certificates.
