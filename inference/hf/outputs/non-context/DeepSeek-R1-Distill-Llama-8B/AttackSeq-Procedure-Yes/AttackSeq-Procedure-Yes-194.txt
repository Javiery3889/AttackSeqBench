Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SparrowDoor communicates with its C&C server using HTTPS after being executed through a remote code execution vulnerability in an internet-facing app. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that SparrowDoor is a malware family, and from what I remember, it's associated with APT29, which is a group known for targeted attacks, often against government entities. These groups are usually sophisticated, so they probably have some advanced techniques.

The question mentions that the initial access was through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. That makes me think of common attack vectors like SQL injection, command injection, or maybe even something like a web application vulnerability that allows remote code execution. Once they have that, they can execute commands like cmd.exe, which is a common way to run malicious code on a compromised system.

Now, after getting initial access, the next step is often establishing command and control (C&C) communication. But how does SparrowDoor do this? I recall that APT29 tends to use encrypted communication to avoid detection. HTTPS is a common method because it's secure and hard to block without knowing the specific certificate or protocol.

So, when SparrowDoor is executed, it's likely to establish a secure channel. Since HTTPS is the standard for secure internet communication, especially for C&C, it's probable that SparrowDoor uses HTTPS to communicate with its servers. This would make sense because using plain HTTP could be easily intercepted, but HTTPS adds encryption, making it harder for defenders to monitor and block the traffic.

Looking at the answer choices, A says "Yes" and B says "No." Based on the group's sophistication and the use of encrypted communication, I think the answer is A. They wouldn't use an insecure method if they're trying to avoid detection.

The SparrowDoor malware, associated with the advanced APT29 group, is likely to use HTTPS for C&C communication due to its focus on evading detection and the group's preference for secure, encrypted channels.

Final Answer: A
