Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether, after using images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems, attackers would verify victims' credentials in real-time and then ask for a 2-step verification code. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that phishing attacks often involve tricking users into revealing sensitive information. In this case, the attackers are using images instead of text in their emails. I remember that some email systems, like Google's, use text-based checks to detect phishing. By using images, the attackers might be trying to bypass these checks because images can be harder to analyze and might not trigger the same security alerts.

So, the first part of the question is about evading detection. Using images could help the phishing email avoid being flagged as suspicious by systems that scan for text-based threats. That makes sense because text is often used in phishing lures, so using images might make the email look less suspicious.

Now, the next part is about whether the attackers would then verify the victims' credentials in real-time. If the email evades initial detection, the attackers might proceed to the next step, which is credential verification. They might use social engineering tactics to trick the victim into revealing their login information. Once they have that, they can access the account.

After successfully verifying the credentials, the next logical step would be to prompt for a 2-step verification code. 2-step verification adds an extra layer of security, so if the attackers have the user's password, they might try to bypass this by asking for the code. They might do this by simulating a login attempt and then prompting for the code, which they can then use to access the account.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: using images to evade detection, followed by credential verification, and then requesting a 2-step verification code. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely they would do that.

The attackers would first use images to evade detection, then verify credentials, and finally request a 2-step verification code.

Final Answer: A: Yes
