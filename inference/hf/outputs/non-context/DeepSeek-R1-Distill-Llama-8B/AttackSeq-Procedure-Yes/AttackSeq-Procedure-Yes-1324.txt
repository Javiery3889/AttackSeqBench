Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke would use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating data via FTP. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what CosmicDuke is. From what I remember, CosmicDuke is a malware associated with APT29, which is a group known for targeted attacks, especially against organizations, often for espionage. They're pretty sophisticated, so their tactics are likely to be well thought out and multi-step.

The question mentions that during collection, they skip certain file types. So, they're probably focusing on specific files that are valuable, like documents, credentials, or sensitive data. But they're not just collecting any files; they're being selective.

Now, the options are whether they'd use keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers. Keyloggers record keystrokes to capture credentials, which makes sense because if they're trying to gather login info. Screenshotters take screenshots, which could capture what's on the screen, maybe login pages or sensitive data. Clipboard stealers would capture whatever is copied to the clipboard, like when someone copies credentials after logging in somewhere.

So, using these tools would help them gather more information without having to go through every file. It's more efficient and less likely to be noticed if they're only taking specific data. After gathering this info, they'd need a way to exfiltrate it. FTP is a common method for transferring files, especially since it's a simple protocol, but it's not the most secure. So, using FTP makes sense for exfiltration because it's easy and widely used, but it's also a known vulnerability.

Putting it all together, CosmicDuke would likely use these tools to gather credentials and other sensitive data efficiently and then send it via FTP to their servers. So the answer should be yes, they would use these tools.

The analysis indicates that CosmicDuke, given its association with APT29, would employ keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers to gather targeted information efficiently. These tools align with their sophisticated tactics, allowing them to collect specific data without broad file collection, which would be more intrusive. Exfiltration via FTP is a plausible method due to its simplicity and common usage, despite its security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
