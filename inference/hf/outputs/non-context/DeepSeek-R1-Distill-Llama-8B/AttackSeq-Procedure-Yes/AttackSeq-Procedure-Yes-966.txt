Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Naikon APT group would use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending data and listening for commands after using the Aria-body backdoor during the discovery phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT groups often use various protocols for communication. The question mentions the Aria-body backdoor, which I think is a tool used for initial access. So during the discovery phase, they gather info using this backdoor.

Now, after the initial access, the next stage is Command and Control (C2). I remember that Naikon APT is known for using HTTP and TCP for their C2 communications. HTTP is commonly used because it's a standard protocol that's often encrypted and can be difficult to block, especially if they're using something like HTTPS. TCP is a reliable protocol for establishing connections and sending data, so it makes sense they'd use that too.

I also recall that some APTs use different protocols based on their specific TTPs. Since Naikon is associated with using these protocols, it's likely they stick with HTTP and TCP for their C2. They probably use these to send stolen data and receive commands from their operators.

So putting it all together, the sequence would involve using HTTP and TCP after the initial backdoor for further communication. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The Naikon APT group is known to utilize HTTP and TCP protocols during their Command and Control phase after initial access. These protocols are effective for securely transmitting data and receiving commands, aligning with their established tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
