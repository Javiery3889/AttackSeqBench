Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Hidden Cobra, after gaining initial access through a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878, would develop Bankshot implants with the ability to give attackers full control over the victim's systems and wipe files. The question is asking if this is likely under the Resource Development tactic.

First, I need to break down the scenario. The initial attack is a spear phishing email with a Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878. I remember that CVE-2018-4878 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office related to how the program parses certain scripts within documents. This exploit allows an attacker to execute malicious code, which in this case is used to gain initial access.

So, after compromising a system, the attacker would likely move laterally within the network to gather more information, escalate privileges, and establish persistence. The mention of Hidden Cobra suggests it's referring to a specific group known for targeting financial organizations, often using various tactics like spear phishing, credential dumping, and data exfiltration.

The question is about whether they would develop Bankshot implants. From what I recall, Bankshot is a type of malware used by Hidden Cobra that can take screenshots, keylog, and other actions, giving attackers remote access and control over systems. It's often used for persistent access and monitoring.

The tactic mentioned is Resource Development, which in the MITRE ATT&CK framework refers to the development and use of tools to interact with the target environment. This could involve creating or utilizing existing tools to achieve specific objectives, like establishing a backdoor or implanting malicious code.

So, after the initial exploit, the attacker would likely develop and deploy Bankshot to gain full control. This makes sense because Bankshot provides the necessary capabilities for remote access and control, which aligns with the goal of Resource Development. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The attacker uses a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access. This exploit allows them to execute malicious code, leading to system compromise. After initial access, the attacker would likely develop and deploy Bankshot implants, which provide remote access and control, aligning with the Resource Development tactic. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
