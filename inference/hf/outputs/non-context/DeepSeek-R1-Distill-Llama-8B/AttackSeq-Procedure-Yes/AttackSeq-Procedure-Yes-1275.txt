Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Yellow Garuda, after collecting data from Telegram, would exfiltrate it over the web and store it in SQLite and JSON. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Yellow Garuda is using a 'grabber' tool to collect messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from Telegram accounts. So, they're gathering a lot of sensitive information. Now, the question is about whether this data is then exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite and JSON formats.

I remember that exfiltration is the process of transferring data out of a system without authorization. So, after collecting the data, the next logical step would be to get it out of the system. Since they're using a tool, it's likely they have a method to transfer this data somewhere else.

SQLite is a common database format, and JSON is a data interchange format. So, if they're storing the data, they might convert it into these formats for easier handling or analysis. But does that mean exfiltration? Well, if the data is being moved from one system to another over the web, that's exfiltration. So, if Yellow Garuda is moving the data from the victim's system to their own or a server, that's exfiltration.

I also think about how cyber actors typically handle data. They often use tools that can collect data and then export it in standard formats. Since SQLite and JSON are both standard formats, it's plausible that the data is being transferred using these formats. Maybe they're using a script or tool that can export the data from Telegram and store it in these formats on a server.

I don't see any immediate red flags that would indicate this isn't possible. The tools exist, and the methods make sense for data transfer. So, I'm leaning towards yes, it's likely they exfiltrate the data over the web and store it in SQLite and JSON.

The data collected by Yellow Garuda is likely exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite and JSON formats. This aligns with common practices where cyber actors export data using standard formats for analysis or further use.

Final Answer: A: Yes
