Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether RIG EK uses malvertising to redirect users to compromised websites before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that RIG EK stands for RIG Exploit Kit, which is a type of cyber attack tool used by malicious actors. EK stands for Exploit Kit, so it's probably related to exploiting software vulnerabilities. Malvertising is malicious advertising, so that's when attackers use legitimate-looking ads to distribute malware.

The question is about the sequence of tactics RIG EK uses. The user is asking if RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to compromised websites and then using an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware via a Command and Scripting Interpreter (CSI).

I think about how these attacks usually work. Often, attackers use malicious ads (malvertising) to serve malicious content or redirect users to a malicious website. Once the user is redirected, they might be taken to a site that drops malware or leads them to a page that downloads an exploit kit. The exploit kit then uses vulnerabilities in software to gain access to the system.

In the context of RIG EK, I recall that it's known for delivering payloads through malicious ads. So, the first step would be the malvertising part, where the user sees an ad that looks legitimate but is actually malicious. This ad might redirect them to a compromised website or a malicious domain controlled by the attackers.

Once the user is on that site, the attackers might use a script, which could be obfuscated to avoid detection. PowerShell is a common tool for scripting, so it's likely they use it to execute commands. The script would then fetch the malware from a server, perhaps using a Command and Scripting Interpreter (CSI) function to execute the malicious code.

Putting it together, the sequence would be: malvertising redirects the user to a compromised site, and then the obfuscated PowerShell script is used to download malware. So the answer should be yes, it's likely that RIG EK does this.

I'm a bit unsure about the exact order, but I think the initial step is the malvertising leading to a redirect, followed by the script execution. I don't see any steps in the question that would suggest a different order, so I think the answer is A: Yes.

The sequence described aligns with known RIG EK tactics. Malvertising redirects users to a compromised site, followed by an obfuscated PowerShell script using CSI to fetch malware.

Final Answer: A: Yes
