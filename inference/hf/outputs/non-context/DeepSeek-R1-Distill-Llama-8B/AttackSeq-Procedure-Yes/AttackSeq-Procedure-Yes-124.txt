Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius used wipers like 'Apostle' after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the IPsec Helper backdoor is used for communication over HTTP. So, the initial step is that Agrius communicates with their C2 (Command and Control) servers using this backdoor. This makes sense because backdoors are a common method for maintaining access and performing various operations.

Next, the question mentions that they perform actions like updating relays or downloading files. Updating relays suggests that they might be using some kind of proxy or intermediary servers to bounce communications to avoid detection. Downloading files could mean they're installing malicious software or configuration changes, which is a typical next step after establishing a backdoor.

Now, the main question is whether they then deploy wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data. Wipers are ransomware that overwrite data, making it inaccessible. So, after establishing a presence on the network and possibly laying low with the backdoor, the next logical step would be to escalate the attack by deploying such malicious software to cause disruption.

I'm thinking about the MITRE ATT&CK framework here. The sub-techniques would likely fall under Initial Access, which includes things like using backdoors. Then, after access is maintained, they might move laterally within the network, update their tools, and then escalate by deploying wipers. This makes the attack sequence make sense: establish access, perform maintenance or data destruction.

I don't see any reasons why they wouldn't proceed to deploy wipers after using the backdoor for communication and updates. It's a common progression in cyberattacks to go from initial access to data destruction as a form of ransom or sabotage.

The sequence starts with using the IPsec Helper backdoor for communication and performing maintenance tasks. This initial access is followed by deploying wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data, aligning with the typical progression of cyberattacks.

Final Answer: A: Yes
