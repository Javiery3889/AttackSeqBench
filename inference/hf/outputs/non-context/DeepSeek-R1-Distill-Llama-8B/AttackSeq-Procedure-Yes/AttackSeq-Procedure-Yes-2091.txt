Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure after using Cobalt Strike and collecting credentials. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing tool used to map internal networks. It's often used by red teams to simulate attacks. So if someone has used Cobalt Strike, they've probably discovered a lot of the organization's internal network structure. They've also collected administrative-level credentials, which are high privilege credentials. High privilege means they can access a lot of resources and move around the network more easily.

Now, the question is whether they'll move laterally. Lateral movement in a network typically refers to moving from one host to another within the same network, like from a compromised workstation to a server or another workstation. Attackers usually do this to escalate their access, gather more data, or deploy further attacks.

Given that they've already mapped the network and have admin credentials, it's logical that they'd want to expand their access. They might start by moving to other machines to gather more information or install malicious software. Without lateral movement, they might not be able to achieve the full scope of their objectives.

I don't see any reasons why they wouldn't move laterally at this point. High privilege usually leads to more, not less, movement. So, the answer should be yes, they are likely to move laterally.

The attackers, having successfully mapped the internal network with Cobalt Strike and obtained administrative credentials, are likely to move laterally to expand their access and further their objectives.

Final Answer: A: Yes
