Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Dexphot would use fileless techniques after using process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what process hollowing is. From what I remember, process hollowing is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process. This allows the malicious code to run with the permissions and context of that process, making it harder to detect because it appears as a legitimate process. So, if Dexphot uses process hollowing, they're probably trying to execute their malicious code without being easily noticed.

Now, the question is about whether Dexphot would then use fileless techniques for defense evasion. Fileless malware, as I understand, doesn't rely on files but instead uses various techniques like in-memory injection, scriptlets, or living off the land. These methods allow the malware to operate without leaving behind files, which can help in evading detection because there's no persistent file to analyze.

So, after using process hollowing, which is a method of loading malware into legitimate processes, using fileless techniques would make sense. The idea is to avoid creating visible files, which could be a red flag for defenders. By using fileless methods, Dexphot can execute malicious code directly in memory, making it harder for security tools to detect the attack.

I'm also thinking about how these techniques might be used together. Process hollowing is about injecting code into existing processes, and fileless techniques are about executing code without files. So, combining these could enhance the stealth and persistence of the attack. The malicious code loaded via process hollowing can then use fileless methods to avoid writing to disk, thus evading file-based detection methods.

I don't see any immediate contradictions here. Process hollowing is about evading detection by mimicking legitimate processes, and fileless techniques are about avoiding detection by not leaving files. They complement each other in the context of defense evasion.

So, putting it all together, yes, it's likely that Dexphot would use fileless techniques after using process hollowing to prevent detection and obfuscate their activities.
