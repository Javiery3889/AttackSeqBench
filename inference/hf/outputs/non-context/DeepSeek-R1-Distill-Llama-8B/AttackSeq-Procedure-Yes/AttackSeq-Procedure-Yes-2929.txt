Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether GHOLE malware will communicate with its C&C servers and if the CWoolger keylogger will upload keystroke logs over 3,000 bytes. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' is used for persistence and creates a mutex called 'woolger'. I remember that VBScript is a scripting language used to create small programs, and a mutex is a synchronization mechanism used to prevent multiple instances of an application from running. So, using 'wsc.vbs' for persistence likely means the malware is ensuring it runs on startup or after a certain event, and the 'woolger' mutex might be part of a defense evasion technique to avoid detection.

Now, the question is about whether GHOLE will communicate with its C&C servers. I know that GHOLE is a known malware, often used by the APT29 group, which is linked to attacks like the SolarWinds attack. GHOLE is known for its persistence mechanisms, including creating scheduled tasks and modifying system services. It also communicates with its C&C servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

The keylogger part is CWoolger. I'm not as familiar with this, but the name suggests it's related to woolger, which I think is a tool used for keylogging. If CWoolger is a keylogger, it would capture keystrokes, which could include sensitive information like passwords, credit cards, etc. The question mentions that it will upload logs exceeding 3,000 bytes. I'm not sure about the exact size limit, but 3,000 bytes isn't that large, so it's plausible that a keylogger could exceed that.

Putting it together, the use of 'wsc.vbs' and 'woolger' mutex suggests the malware is setting up persistence and possibly evading detection. Since GHOLE is known for C&C communication, it's likely that after establishing persistence, it would reach out to its command and control servers. Additionally, if CWoolger is active, it would start capturing keystrokes, which would be sent to the C&C as well. The size limit mentioned (3,000 bytes) is probably a red herring because keyloggers can capture much more data, so exceeding that is expected.

I'm a bit unsure about the exact mechanics of how the size is measuredâ€”maybe it's the size of each log entry or the total per session. But given that keyloggers can capture a significant amount of data, it's reasonable to assume that the logs would exceed 3,000 bytes over time. Also, since the question is about whether it's "likely," the answer should be based on the typical behavior of these malware and keyloggers.

So, considering all this, the answer should be yes, both communication with C&C and the upload of keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes are likely.

The use of 'wsc.vbs' for persistence and the 'woolger' mutex indicates that GHOLE malware is setting up mechanisms to ensure it runs on startup and avoids detection. GHOLE is known for establishing communication with its C&C servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Additionally, CWoolger, a keylogger, would capture keystrokes, which are likely to exceed 3,000 bytes when uploaded to C&C servers. Therefore, both events are probable.

Final Answer: A: Yes
