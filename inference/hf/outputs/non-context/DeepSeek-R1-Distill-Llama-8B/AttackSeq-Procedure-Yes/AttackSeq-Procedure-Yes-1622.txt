Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT28 would use advstoreshell.dll for encrypted communication with their C&C server using HTTP on port 443 or 80. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT28 is a group known for their attacks, often targeting large organizations. They're known for using various tools and techniques. The question mentions that they deploy pr.dll for data collection, which then uploads stolen information to the C&C server. So, pr.dll is their data collection tool.

Now, the question is about whether they use advstoreshell.dll for encrypted communication. I'm not as familiar with advstoreshell.dll specifically, but I can think about how cyber actors typically communicate with their command and control servers. Usually, they use encrypted protocols to avoid detection. Common ones include HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) on port 443, which is a common port for encrypted traffic, or HTTP on port 80, which is the standard HTTP port but often used with encryption as well.

I remember that APT28 has been linked to using various tools like Mimikatz for credential dumping and other post-exploitation tools. They might use different tools for different stages of their attacks. So, pr.dll is for data collection, and maybe advstoreshell.dll is another tool, possibly for communication.

Since they're using HTTP, which is typically on port 80, but when encrypted, it's usually HTTPS on 443. So, if they're using HTTP for communication, it's likely encrypted using TLS, hence port 443. Alternatively, they might use port 80 with encryption, but 443 is more common for HTTPS.

I think that in many cases, especially for C&C communication, they use encrypted channels to avoid being detected. So, using HTTP over 443 makes sense. Therefore, it's likely that advstoreshell.dll would use HTTPS on port 443 for communication.

The analysis suggests that APT28 would use HTTPS on port 443 for encrypted communication with their C&C server, as it's a common and secure practice for avoiding detection.
