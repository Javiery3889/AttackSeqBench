Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a PowerShell script that's evading defenses by using a specific DCOM object to execute files in memory and not save them to disk would likely communicate with C2 servers to download Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the MITRE ATT&CK framework is a common reference for understanding cyber threats. The question mentions that the script is using a DCOM object with the GUID C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880. I remember that DCOM objects can be used as a mechanism for persistence or to execute commands without writing to disk, which fits the description here.

The script is evading detection by operating in memory, which suggests it's using techniques like living off the land or memory-based persistence. This is often done to avoid writing files to disk, making it harder for defenders to detect the malicious activity.

Now, considering the TTPs involved, using DCOM to execute files in memory is a common technique in some malware, especially older ones like Ursnif. Ursnif is known for using DCOM to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. Similarly, GandCrab is a ransomware that can spread through various methods, including using DCOM for persistence.

The next part is about communication with C2 servers. If the script is using DCOM, it might not directly communicate over the same protocol as HTTP or HTTPS. However, some DCOM-based malware does use certain protocols to communicate with their C2s. Alternatively, the script might use other methods like DNS or HTTP to reach out to their command and control servers.

I'm a bit unsure about whether DCOM alone would be enough for communication. DCOM can be monitored, so some malware might use it for persistence but rely on other methods for command and control. Alternatively, the script might use DCOM to execute commands but use another protocol for C2 communication.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether it's "likely" that the script will communicate with C2 servers. Since both Ursnif and GandCrab are known to use DCOM for persistence and command execution, it's plausible that the script would also use it for communication. However, I'm not entirely certain if DCOM is the primary method for C2 communication or if it's just for execution.

Wait, maybe I should think about how these malware families actually work. Ursnif, for example, uses DCOM to inject into processes and spread, but does it use DCOM for C2? Or does it use another protocol like HTTP? I think some versions might use HTTP, while others might use DCOM for C2 as well. Similarly, GandCrab might use DCOM for persistence but might have separate communication methods.

So, considering that the script is using DCOM to execute files in memory, it's possible that it's also using DCOM for C2, especially if the malware is designed that way. Therefore, the answer would lean towards yes, it's likely.

The script uses DCOM to execute files in memory, a technique often employed by malware like Ursnif and GandCrab for persistence and command execution. Given their known behavior, it's plausible that the script communicates with C2 servers using DCOM or other protocols, making the answer likely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
