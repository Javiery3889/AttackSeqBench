Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius would use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP. The initial access is through exploiting public-facing applications with CVE-2018-13379.

First, I need to understand the context. CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability, so I should look that up. From what I remember, CVE-2018-13379 is related to Apache Struts, specifically a remote code execution vulnerability. So, exploiting this would allow an attacker to execute malicious code on the vulnerable system, giving them a way to gain initial access.

Once they have access, what are the typical next steps for an attacker like Agrius? I know that after breaching into a system, attackers often look to establish persistence, move laterally within the network, and communicate with their command and control (C2) servers. 

Webshells are a common tool for this. Webshells are malicious scripts that can be uploaded to a web application to create a backdoor or a tunnel. They can be used to tunnel traffic, like RDP, which is a common protocol for remote access. So, using a webshell would allow Agrius to tunnel RDP traffic, which might be necessary if direct RDP access is blocked or restricted.

After establishing a webshell, the next step might be lateral movement. Compromised accounts, such as those with administrative privileges, would help in moving across different machines within the network. This makes sense because having access to these accounts can allow the attacker to escalate privileges or move to other systems more easily.

Once they've moved laterally, they might need to communicate securely with their C2 servers. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP could be used for this. IPsec is a secure protocol, but using it over HTTP might mean they're using it in a non-standard way, perhaps for tunneling or as a command and control channel. This would make sense as a way to maintain communication without being easily detected.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: exploit the vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379) to gain access, use a webshell for tunneling RDP and lateral movement via compromised accounts, and then use the IPsec Helper backdoor over HTTP for C2 communication. So, the answer should be yes, Agrius would do this.

The sequence of TTPs described aligns with typical attacker behavior following an initial exploit. After gaining access via CVE-2018-13379, using webshells for tunneling and lateral movement, followed by IPsec Helper for C2 communication, is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
