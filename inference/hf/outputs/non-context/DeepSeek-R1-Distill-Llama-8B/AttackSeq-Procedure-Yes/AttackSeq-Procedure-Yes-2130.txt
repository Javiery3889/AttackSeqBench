Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the script 'stopedge.bat' deleting files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' would contribute to persistence by scheduling 'install.vbs'. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that 'stopedge.bat' is a script used for defense evasion. Defense evasion techniques are about avoiding detection by hiding or removing files that might indicate an attack. So, if 'stopedge.bat' is deleting these files, it's probably trying to clean up or remove traces of malicious activity.

Now, the question is whether this script would schedule 'install.vbs' to run periodically. Scheduling a script to run automatically at certain times is a common way to achieve persistence because it keeps the malicious activity going even after the initial attack phase.

But wait, 'install.vbs' is another script. If 'stopedge.bat' is deleting other files, it's more about cleaning up, not necessarily about making sure 'install.vbs' runs. The primary purpose of 'stopedge.bat' seems to be defense, not to set up persistence mechanisms. So, it's unlikely that this script would be used to schedule 'install.vbs' for periodic execution.

I'm also thinking about how these scripts typically operate. Defense evasion scripts usually focus on removing or obfuscating malicious files, not on creating persistence mechanisms. Persistence is more about ensuring the attack continues or reoccurs, which is a separate tactic. So, the script's role here is to avoid detection, not to make sure other malicious scripts run again later.

Therefore, it's more probable that 'stopedge.bat' isn't used for persistence. So, the answer should be 'No'.

The script 'stopedge.bat' is used for defense evasion by deleting files, not for creating persistence mechanisms. Persistence typically involves ensuring continued execution, which isn't the purpose here.

Final Answer: B: No
