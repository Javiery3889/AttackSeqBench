Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether cyber adversaries would use HTTPS to deliver obfuscated malware after installing malware like Emotet and Agent Tesla. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Emotet and Agent Tesla are both malware used in cyberattacks. Emotet is known for being a payload delivery system that can spread through networks, often using legitimate-looking files like Excel documents. Agent Tesla, on the other hand, is a keylogger that can capture keystrokes and credentials, which helps in lateral movement within a network.

The question is about whether these adversaries would use HTTPS to deliver obfuscated malware. I remember that HTTPS is a secure protocol that encrypts data, making it harder to intercept. But wait, if the malware is already installed, why would they need to use HTTPS for delivery? Maybe I'm mixing up the stages of an attack.

So, the initial delivery of malware is often done through phishing emails, malicious links, or other methods that don't necessarily use HTTPS. Once the malware is installed, the adversaries might use it to move laterally, which is where Agent Tesla comes in. It captures credentials, enabling access to more systems.

But the question is about delivering obfuscated malware. Obfuscation is used to hide the true nature of the malware, making it harder to detect. However, using HTTPS might not be the primary method for delivering something that's already been installed. Instead, they might use other methods like HTTP or even P2P networks for initial delivery.

Wait, but maybe after initial installation, they use HTTPS to communicate with their command and control centers. That makes sense because HTTPS is secure and can help avoid detection. But the question is specifically about delivering the malware, not communication post-installation.

So, the initial delivery of Emotet and Agent Tesla is likely through unencrypted channels, not HTTPS. Therefore, using HTTPS for delivering the malware itself isn't common. Instead, they might use it for command and control after the malware is already on the system.

So, the answer would be that it's unlikely they use HTTPS for delivering the malware because they already have it installed, and delivery is done through other means. Therefore, the answer is No.
</think>

The adversaries typically use non-HTTPS channels for delivering initial malware like Emotet and Agent Tesla. HTTPS is more commonly used for post-installation communication, not for the delivery phase. Thus, it's unlikely they use HTTPS for delivering obfuscated malware.

Final Answer: B: No
