Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware described will create a new process to execute the dropped .exe file after rewriting itself into the %Temp% folder with a randomized hex filename and .tmp extension. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware is delivered via 'Thu moi.7z', which contains 'Thumoi.hta'. I know that .hta files are HTML applications, often used for various scripts, including VBScript. So, when this file is executed, it's likely running a VBScript.

The VBScript then drops a decoy Microsoft Word file. So, the first action is dropping a file, probably to mislead or distract the user, making it look like a legitimate document.

Now, the question is about whether the malware will then create a new process to execute the .exe file. The malware is said to rewrite itself into the %Temp% folder with a randomized hex filename and a .tmp extension. I'm a bit confused here because .tmp is typically associated with temporary files, like those created during Windows installations or by certain applications. But in the context of malware, it might be used to avoid detection by using a unique filename.

So, after dropping the .exe, does the malware create a new process to run it? I'm thinking about how malware operates. Often, after dropping a payload, malware might execute it immediately or through a scheduled task. But in this case, the question is specifically about creating a new process after rewriting the file.

Wait, the VBScript is dropping the .exe and then the malware is rewriting itself. So, after the VBScript runs, the malware might be creating a new process to execute the .exe. But I'm not entirely sure. I remember that some malware uses .tmp files as a way to execute malicious code because they can be run directly, but I'm not certain if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the .exe is being dropped, and the malware is using a new process to run it. Since the filename is randomized, it might be an attempt to avoid detection. So, the sequence would be: execute VBScript, drop .exe, then create a new process to run it.

I think the answer is yes, the malware would create a new process to execute the .exe after rewriting it. So, the answer should be A: Yes.
</think>

The malware, after executing the VBScript and dropping a decoy .doc file, rewrites itself into the %Temp% folder as a .tmp file with a randomized hex name. It's likely that the malware then creates a new process to execute this .exe file, possibly using the .tmp as a wrapper to avoid detection. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
