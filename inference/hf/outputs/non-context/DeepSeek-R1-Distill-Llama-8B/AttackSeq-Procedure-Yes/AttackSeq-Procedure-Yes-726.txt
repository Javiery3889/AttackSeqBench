Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant would use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration after performing initial reconnaissance. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Rising Sun implant was used in the attack described. The initial step was reconnaissance, where it collected system and network details. It communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, which were encrypted with RC4 and then Base64 encoded. So, during the initial communication, they used these two encryption methods.

Now, the question is about whether the same methods would be used for data exfiltration. I remember that in cyberattacks, the same tools and techniques used during initial stages are often reused for further actions. So, if they used RC4 and Base64 for communication, it's likely they'd continue using them for data exfiltration because consistency in methods can help avoid detection.

RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means the same key is used for encryption and decryption. Using it for data exfiltration makes sense because it's efficient and consistent. Base64 encoding is commonly used to obfuscate data, making it less likely to be noticed by network traffic analysis. So, using the same encoding for exfiltration would maintain the same level of stealth.

I also think about how attackers operate. They often prefer using the same tactics they've already tested and are familiar with. Using different methods each time can lead to mistakes, like using the wrong encryption key or improper encoding, which could be easier to detect. So, it's logical that they'd stick with what worked in the initial phase.

Additionally, using RC4 and Base64 together provides double-layered protection. The data is first encrypted with RC4, making it secure, and then Base64 encodes it into a string of characters, which can be transmitted over the network without raising immediate suspicions.

I don't see any reasons why they would change their encryption and encoding methods once they've established a working communication channel. It's more efficient and less risky in terms of detection.

So, putting it all together, the most plausible sequence would indeed use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration.

The Rising Sun implant used RC4 and Base64 during initial communication, so it's logical they'd continue using these methods for data exfiltration to maintain consistency and avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
