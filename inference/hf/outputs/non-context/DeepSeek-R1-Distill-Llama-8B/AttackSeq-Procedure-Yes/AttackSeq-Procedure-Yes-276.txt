Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script from 'sdmc.jpg' before downloading a zip file containing malware components. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial attack involves delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document. When someone opens this document, it's likely that it's a phishing email or a document that triggers a macro. Since it's a Word document, it's probably using a macro to execute some code. But in this case, the malicious content is delivered inside a ZIP file. So the user receives a ZIP file, maybe as an attachment, which they might not expect, but they open it.

Inside the ZIP file, there's a file named 'fmx.ps1'. PowerShell scripts can be a common way for malware to be delivered because they can execute code without needing to be in a trusted location. The fact that it's a .ps1 file suggests it's a PowerShell script. Now, the question is whether this script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.

So, the 'fmx.ps1' script is the initial access point. When the user opens the ZIP file, the script might be executed. The script's purpose is to decode another script from 'sdmc.jpg'. Base64 encoding is a method used to embed binary data within a text file, so 'sdmc.jpg' is likely a container for another script that's been encoded.

I remember that in some cases, malicious scripts use base64 to hide their code within images or other files. So, the 'fmx.ps1' script would probably use a base64 decoding function to extract the embedded script from 'sdmc.jpg'. Once decoded, this script would be executed, which could be the next stage of the attack.

After executing the decoded script, the next step is that this script would download a zip file containing the malware payload components. So the sequence would be: execute 'fmx.ps1', which decodes 'sdmc.jpg' into a script, which then runs and downloads the malicious zip file.

I think the key here is understanding the order of operations. The initial script runs, it decodes the embedded script, which then performs further actions, including downloading more malicious content. So yes, the 'fmx.ps1' would execute the decoding before downloading the zip file.

The 'fmx.ps1' script is executed first, which decodes the base64 encoded script from 'sdmc.jpg'. This decoded script then proceeds to download the zip file containing the malware components.

Final Answer: A: Yes
