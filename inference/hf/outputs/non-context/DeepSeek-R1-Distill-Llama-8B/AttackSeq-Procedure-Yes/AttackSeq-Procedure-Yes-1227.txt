Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether The Inception attackers would exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER after conducting a reconnaissance spear phish. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question is saying. The question is about the attack sequence used by The Inception attackers. They start with a reconnaissance spear phish. Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack, so they're probably gathering information about their targets, maybe through email or other means.

Next, after the reconnaissance, they might look to exploit a vulnerability. The specific vulnerability mentioned is CVE-2017-11882. I should recall what that CVE is about. From what I remember, CVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Word that allows remote code execution. It was a significant vulnerability at the time, so it's plausible that attackers would use it.

The question is whether they would use this exploit via remote templates in Microsoft Word. So, after the initial phish, they might send a document that triggers the exploit when opened. That makes sense because using templates can help distribute malicious code without needing direct interaction beyond opening the file.

Then, after exploiting the vulnerability, they would deploy POWERSHOWER, which is a PowerShell backdoor. POWERSHOWER is a tool that gives attackers remote access to a compromised system, so it's a logical next step after gaining a foothold in the network.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." I need to decide which makes more sense. The sequence described aligns with how cyber attackers typically operate: gather intelligence, exploit a known vulnerability, and then establish a persistent backdoor. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The attackers would likely use the CVE-2017-11882 exploit through Microsoft Word templates after a spear phish to gain initial access, then deploy POWERSHOWER for further activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
