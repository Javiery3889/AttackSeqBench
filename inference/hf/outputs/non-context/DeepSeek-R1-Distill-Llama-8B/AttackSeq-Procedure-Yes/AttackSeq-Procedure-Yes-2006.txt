Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether BlackEnergy 3, a malicious implant, would establish communication with its Command-and-Control (C2) servers after being installed on a network through employee-enabled macro execution. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that BlackEnergy is a known malware used in cyber espionage activities. It's typically used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, often associated with state-sponsored actors. The question mentions that the malware is installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution. I'm assuming this means that an employee, possibly via a phishing email or a malicious document, executes a macro that drops the BlackEnergy implant.

Now, after installation, what happens next? Well, during the initial stages of an attack, attackers often conduct reconnaissance to gather information about the target network. This could involve mapping the network, identifying key systems, and gathering credentials. The question mentions that reconnaissance includes gathering publicly available info and active discovery methods, so the attackers are probably using tools to explore the network further.

Once the implant is on the network, it's likely that the malware would establish communication with its C2 servers. This communication is crucial for the attackers to receive commands, upload stolen data, and control the implant's behavior. The implant would need to reach out to its C2 server to receive instructions, whether it's to collect more data, exfiltrate information, or perform other malicious activities.

I'm thinking about how the implant communicates. Malware like BlackEnergy might use encrypted communication protocols to avoid detection. It might use protocols like HTTPs or custom protocols to send data securely. The C2 server would then respond with instructions, possibly in a subsequent communication.

So, putting it all together, after the initial installation via macro execution, the BlackEnergy implant would likely establish a connection to its C2 server to receive commands and further instructions. This makes sense because without communication with the C2, the implant wouldn't be able to function effectively as a tool for espionage.

I don't see any reasons why the communication wouldn't happen. The question is about whether it's "likely," and given the typical behavior of such malware, the answer should be yes.

The BlackEnergy 3 implant, after being installed via employee-enabled macro execution, would likely establish communication with its Command-and-Control (C2) servers. This communication is essential for the implant to receive commands and perform its intended malicious activities, such as data exfiltration or further network exploration. Therefore, it's highly probable that this communication occurs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
