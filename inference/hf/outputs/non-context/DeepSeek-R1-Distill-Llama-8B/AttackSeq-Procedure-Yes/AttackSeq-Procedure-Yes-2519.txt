Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the BlueDelta campaign exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 as the initial access point before moving on to exploit vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software for discovery activities. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand what BlueDelta is. From what I remember, BlueDelta is a cyber espionage group, often linked to Russian-speaking actors, known for targeting government and critical infrastructure sectors. They're associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) and have been involved in attacks that involve initial access brokering, credential dumping, and lateral movement within networks.

Now, the question is about the sequence of tactics they used. The first part is using CVE-2020-35730 on Roundcube mail servers. I should check what that CVE is. Looking it up, CVE-2020-35730 is a vulnerability in Roundcube related to the "roundcube-plugin-manage-interfaces" component. It's a remote code execution vulnerability, which means an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system. That's a significant vulnerability, so it's a good initial access point.

So, the first step would be BlueDelta exploiting this CVE to gain initial access into the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers. Once they have access, the next step is to exploit vulnerabilities in the Roundcube webmail software for discovery. I'm not sure if the same CVE is used here or a different one. But the question is about the sequence, not the specific CVEs used in each step.

The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes these actions under Initial Access (T1078: Exploiting a Vulnerability) and then Discovery (T1082: Information Gathering). So, the sequence makes sense: exploit a vulnerability for access (T1078) and then gather information (T1082).

I don't recall any specific reports that BlueDelta used this particular CVE, but the question is about whether this sequence is plausible. Since the first step is a known vulnerability that's been used in APT attacks, and the second step is typical discovery activities, the answer should be yes.

The BlueDelta campaign likely exploited CVE-2020-35730 to access Roundcube mail servers, then used other vulnerabilities in Roundcube for discovery. This aligns with initial access and information gathering tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
