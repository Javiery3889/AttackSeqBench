Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the scenario described is likely. The question is about whether malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect users to an exploit landing page using CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome before the attackers used heap spraying techniques to gain arbitrary read/write access and execute shellcode.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence. The question mentions two main steps: inserting malicious JavaScript into a portal and then using heap spraying to gain primitives and execute shellcode. The CVE mentioned is 2019-13720, which I should look up to understand what it is.

Looking up CVE-2019-13720, it's a vulnerability in Google Chrome related to the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows remote code execution by exploiting a use after free vulnerability in the v8::ArrayBuffer::From* functions. Attackers can use this to create a buffer overflow, leading to arbitrary read/write access, which is a big deal because it can allow them to execute malicious code.

Now, the question is about the sequence. Did the attackers first inject malicious JavaScript to redirect users to an exploit page, and then use heap spraying via CVE-2019-13720? Or is it the other way around?

Heap spraying is a technique where attackers allocate a large array of memory (a heap) and overwrite it with shellcode. This is often used after gaining some level of privileges, typically through a vulnerability like CVE-2019-13720, which gives them the necessary read/write access.

So, the logical flow would be: first, the attackers need to get the victim to a page where the exploit can be triggered. That's where the malicious JavaScript injection comes in. The injected code would check if the browser is vulnerable (using a check for CVE-2019-13720) and then trigger the exploit, which would lead to the heap spraying and execution of shellcode.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "before attackers utilized heap spraying..." So the initial step is the JavaScript injection, then the exploit using the CVE. That makes sense because the exploit would be delivered via the injected script. So the sequence is: inject malicious JS to redirect to the exploit page, which then uses the vulnerability to gain primitives and execute shellcode.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether this scenario is likely. Since the steps make sense in order, the answer should be yes.
</think>

The scenario describes a logical attack sequence where malicious JavaScript is injected to redirect users to an exploit page, which then uses CVE-2019-13720 to gain access to arbitrary read/write primitives, enabling shellcode execution. This aligns with typical attack methods, making the scenario plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
