Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Shellbot is likely to establish C&C communication via an IRC channel after gathering information about the infected host. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Shellbot is a tool often used in cyberattacks, probably related to the Shells family of malware. These types of tools are typically used for lateral movement within a network, data exfiltration, and establishing command and control (C&C) communication. 

The question mentions that the attacker has gathered information about the infected host, such as the number of processor cores, the type of processor, and whether monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions are installed. So, the attacker is likely doing reconnaissance to understand the environment before taking further actions.

Now, considering the possible TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) that Shellbot might use. I remember that Shellbot is known for using various communication methods. Common ones include IRC, HTTP, or HTTPS for C&C. IRC is an older protocol but still used by some malware because it's simple and reliable for communication.

The question is specifically about IRC. So, after gathering info about the host, the next step might be to establish a communication channel. Since the attacker has already assessed the environment, they might choose the most suitable method based on what's available or what's less likely to be monitored.

I should also think about whether the presence of Splunk or antivirus affects this. If Splunk is installed, it's a SIEM tool that could monitor for suspicious activities. Antivirus solutions might block certain protocols. So, if the attacker finds that IRC is blocked or Splunk is active, they might avoid using IRC. But the question doesn't specify that these tools are actively monitoring or blocking IRC.

Given that the attacker is gathering initial info, they might proceed to establish a C&C channel. IRC is a common method, so it's a plausible next step unless there are specific indicators that it's not feasible. Since the question doesn't mention any blocking or detection, the attacker would likely proceed with IRC.

The attacker, after gathering information about the infected host, is likely to establish C&C communication via an IRC channel. This is a common method used by Shellbot, and without specific indicators of blocking or detection, it remains a plausible next step.

Final Answer: A: Yes
