Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT10 would compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR before exfiltrating it via cURL for Windows. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that APT10 accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller using Mimikatz for credential theft. Mimikatz is a tool commonly used by attackers to dump credentials, so that makes sense as the initial access vector.

Now, after accessing the domain controller, the next step would be to gather data. APT groups like APT10 are known for their targeted attacks, often focusing on stealing sensitive data. So, they might look for ways to exfiltrate data. One common method is to compress the data to make it smaller and easier to transfer, especially over slow or unreliable networks.

WinRAR is a popular compression tool, so using it to compress data is plausible. It's a tool that many attackers might use because it's widely available and effective. So, compressing the data with WinRAR would be a logical next step.

Then, the question is about how they exfiltrate the data. The options given are using cURL for Windows. cURL is a command-line tool that can transfer data using various protocols like HTTP or FTP. So, using cURL to send the compressed data to a remote server, like a Dropbox account, is a common method for exfiltration. Attackers often use public file-sharing services because they're easy to set up and can be accessed from anywhere.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: access with Mimikatz, compress data with WinRAR, then exfiltrate using cURL. So, the answer should be yes, APT10 would do that.

The sequence of TTPs described aligns with known APT10 tactics. After accessing the domain controller, compressing data with WinRAR and exfiltrating via cURL fits their methodical approach.

Final Answer: A: Yes
