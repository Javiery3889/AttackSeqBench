Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores and then upload them to an external FTP server after configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the MITRE ATT&CK framework is a common reference for understanding cyber threats. The question is about the tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by the attackers. The user mentioned that the attackers have configured applications to run batch files every hour, which suggests they're setting up some form of scheduled task or cron job. This is often used for persistence, keeping the attack going without needing manual intervention.

Now, the question is whether they would use legitimate applications to collect credentials. I'm thinking about what the Phantom Menace group typically does. From what I remember, they're known for using legitimate tools and techniques to blend in with normal operations. So, using legitimate applications makes sense because it reduces suspicion.

They might use legitimate tools to gather credentials from password stores. Password stores are where credentials are stored, like in Active Directory or other password managers. Tools like Mimikatz can dump credentials, but if they're using legitimate applications, maybe they're using something like a legitimate system tool or a utility that's commonly used, such as a batch script or a built-in command-line tool.

After collecting the credentials, the next step would be to exfiltration. The question mentions uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they control. FTP is a common, older protocol, but it's still used, so it's plausible. Using an external server would allow them to store the credentials securely, perhaps for later use or to share with other actors.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: setting up scheduled tasks (batch files every hour) to maintain persistence, using legitimate tools to collect credentials from password stores, and then exfiltrating those credentials via FTP to their controlled server. This aligns with how advanced persistent threats operate, using both technical and procedural methods to stay undetected and maintain access over time.

I'm a bit unsure about whether using FTP is the most common method these days, but considering it's a legitimate protocol and might be less monitored, it's a plausible choice. Also, the use of legitimate applications fits the group's modus operandi of using tools that appear normal to avoid detection.

So, considering all this, the answer should be yes, it's likely they would do this.

The sequence described aligns with the tactics of the Phantom Menace group, who often use legitimate tools and protocols to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. Configuring batch files for hourly execution ensures ongoing access, and using legitimate methods to collect credentials from password stores fits their operational style. Uploading these credentials to an external FTP server, a common yet less scrutinized method, allows for secure storage and potential sharing. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
