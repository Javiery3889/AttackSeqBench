Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attack described in the question is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the attacker used Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199 for initial access. I remember that CVE-2017-0199 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows remote code execution. So, when a user opens a malicious .docx file, it can execute arbitrary code. That makes sense as the initial access vector.

Next, the attack is said to have executed an embedded .hta file using mshta.exe. I know that .hta files are HTML applications, and mshta.exe is the Microsoft HTML Application executable. Since the vulnerability in Office can execute code, it's plausible that the attacker used this to run mshta.exe, which then executes the .hta file. So that's the initial execution part.

Then, the question mentions that the attack achieved persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes. I'm a bit fuzzy on this part. I recall that mshta.exe can be used to create scheduled tasks. The task name 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' sounds familiar. Wait, I think that's a legitimate task used by Google for updates, but in this context, it's being used maliciously. So, the attacker would use mshta.exe to create a scheduled task that runs a VBS file, which would execute some malicious code each time it runs.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: Exploit the CVE to execute mshta.exe, which then runs the .hta file. Then, using mshta.exe again, the attacker schedules a task to run a VBS file periodically. This would allow the attacker to maintain persistence and possibly perform further actions each time the task runs.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Since all the steps described in the question align with how this attack would proceed, the answer should be A: Yes.
</think>

The attack begins with exploiting CVE-2017-0199 through a malicious .docx file, leading to the execution of mshta.exe and an embedded .hta file. The attacker then uses mshta.exe to schedule a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to run a VBS file every 3 minutes, enabling persistence. This sequence is consistent with known attack behavior.

Final Answer: A
