Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether recipients of a spear phishing email will see a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT. The email contains links to RTF files exploiting CVE-2017-8750, which I know is related to QuasarRAT, a remote access trojan. 

First, I need to understand what QuasarRAT does. From what I remember, QuasarRAT is a malware that allows attackers to remotely access and control infected systems. It's often delivered through malicious documents, like RTF files, which can execute code when opened. The CVE-2017-8750 refers to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that the RTF files exploit to drop the QuasarRAT payload.

Now, the question is about whether before the infection happens, the recipients will see a document that looks like a legitimate blog post or report. I'm thinking about the typical tactics attackers use. Often, they try to make the attack look as legitimate as possible to bypass detection or user suspicion. So, maybe the attackers would send a document that appears to be a genuine report or blog post to trick the user into opening it.

Wait, but how does that work with the exploit? If the email has a link to an RTF file, the user would typically click on it, which would trigger the exploit. But if the document is presented as a blog post, maybe it's embedded within the email or as an attachment. Alternatively, perhaps the document is attached as a PDF or another format that doesn't immediately trigger the exploit, but when opened, it might prompt the user to click somewhere else or download something else.

Alternatively, maybe the attackers use a document that's actually a dropper or a document that triggers the exploit upon opening. But the question is specifically about whether the document simulates a legitimate blog post or report before the infection. So, perhaps the initial document is a decoy or a lure to get the user to open it, which then leads to the infection.

I'm a bit confused about how the infection process works. Does the RTF file exploit immediately upon opening, or does it require some interaction? I think some RTF exploits can execute code upon opening, so the moment the user opens the file, the payload is dropped. But maybe the document is designed to look like a legitimate report to trick the user into opening it, which then leads to the infection.

So, in this case, the answer would be yes, because the attackers would use a legitimate-looking document as a lure to get the user to open the RTF file, which then triggers the exploit and delivers QuasarRAT.

The attackers are likely to present a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report to trick recipients into opening the RTF file, which then triggers the CVE-2017-8750 exploit, delivering QuasarRAT.

Final Answer: A: Yes
