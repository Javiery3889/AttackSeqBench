Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used here. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that an attacker exploited CVE-2015-5119 to save and execute a file called "%Temp%/Rdws.exe". Then, this second-stage PlugX file communicates with C2 domains like inocnation[.]com. I need to find out which ATT&CK technique facilitated this communication.

First, I should recall what each of these TTPs does. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: T1001.002 - Steganography. I know that steganography is about hiding data within other files, like images or audio. It's not typically used for communication between the malware and its C2 server. So maybe not this one.

Option B: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol. T1071 is about using legitimate protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate. Since the question mentions communication with a domain, this could be it. Malware often uses HTTP to send data to C2s.

Option C: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise. This is more about compromising a system by exploiting a vulnerability during a drive-by attack, like using an exploit kit. But the question is about communication after the initial exploit, so probably not this one.

Option D: T1005 - Data from Local System. This involves exfiltration of data from the compromised system. It's about data transfer, not communication methods. So not the right fit here.

So, the initial exploit is CVE-2015-5119, which is a vulnerability. I think that's related to the Windows color management component. After that, the Rdws.exe is executed, which is the second stage. The communication from Rdws.exe to inocnation[.]com would likely use a protocol like HTTP, which is T1071. So the answer should be B.

The most plausible ATT&CK technique used here is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it facilitates communication via HTTP or HTTPS, which is likely how the PlugX file communicates with the C2 domain.

Final Answer: B
