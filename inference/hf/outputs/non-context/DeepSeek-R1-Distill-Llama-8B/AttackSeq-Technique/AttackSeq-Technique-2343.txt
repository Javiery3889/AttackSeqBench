Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used after executing a VBA macro that downloads a dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL. The question is asking which technique ensures continuous execution of malicious code every two hours. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the initial action is using a VBA macro in an Office document, which is a common way for malware to enter a system. The macro executes 'mshta.exe', which is a known malicious executable. This executable then downloads a VBScript from a Blogspot URL. So, the initial TTP here is T1537, which is the execution of mshta.exe.

Now, the question is about what happens next to ensure the malicious code runs continuously every two hours. I'm thinking about what techniques are used to schedule tasks on a system. One possibility is scheduling tasks using Task Scheduler, which is a built-in Windows feature. I recall that T1053 refers to Scheduled Task/Job, which involves creating scheduled tasks to run executables at specified times.

Another option is T1505.005, which is about using Terminal Services to execute commands. This could involve using tools like mstsc to connect to a remote session or maybe using psexec to run commands remotely. However, I'm not sure if this is the most likely method for continuous execution in this context.

T1565 is Data Manipulation, which involves manipulating data, but that doesn't directly relate to scheduling or continuous execution. Phishing (T1566) is more about deceptive tactics, like fake emails or websites, which doesn't fit here either.

So, putting it together, the most likely technique after the initial execution is T1053, which would schedule the malicious VBScript to run every two hours. This ensures the dropper runs periodically, maintaining persistence and allowing further malicious activities.

The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using T1053-Scheduled Task/Job to schedule the execution of the malicious VBScript every two hours, ensuring continuous operation.

Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
