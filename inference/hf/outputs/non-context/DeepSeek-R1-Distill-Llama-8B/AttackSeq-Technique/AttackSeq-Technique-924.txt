Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used in this scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about a scenario where a Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during its runtime to execute tasks. The key here is that it's maintaining its presence across reboots, specifically using paths like %systemroot%\system32 or %programfiles%. 

First, I need to recall what each of these TTPs means. 

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process. This technique is about creating or altering existing system processes. It could involve spawning new processes or modifying existing ones, which might help in persistence, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit here.

B: T1110-Brute Force. This is about brute-forcing authentication, like password guessing. Doesn't seem directly related to persistence across reboots.

C: T1129-Shared Modules. This involves sharing modules between processes, which can help in persistence by keeping the process alive across reboots. If the DLL is loaded into a shared module, it might be loaded by the system on boot.

D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager. This technique is about managing application domains, which can help in maintaining persistence by ensuring the process is restarted in a new app domain after a crash or reboot.

Now, the question mentions the Trojan dynamically loading a DLL. So, the main point is how it maintains presence after reboots. DLLs are typically loaded into processes, and if the system is rebooted, the process might not automatically restart unless there's a mechanism to do so.

T1129, Shared Modules, allows the process to share a module with the system, which can help in persistence. When the system boots, the shared module is loaded, bringing the process back. This makes sense because the DLL would be part of the shared module, ensuring it's loaded each time.

T1574.014, AppDomainManager, is more about managing app domains, which might not directly relate to the DLL loading across reboots. It's more about process management rather than module sharing.

T1543 is about processes, but creating or modifying them might not directly address the DLL persistence across reboots as effectively as sharing modules.

So, putting it together, the most likely technique is T1129-Shared Modules because it ensures the DLL remains loaded after reboots by sharing the module with the system.

The most plausible technique is T1129-Shared Modules, as it ensures the DLL remains loaded across reboots by sharing the module with the system.

Final Answer: C
