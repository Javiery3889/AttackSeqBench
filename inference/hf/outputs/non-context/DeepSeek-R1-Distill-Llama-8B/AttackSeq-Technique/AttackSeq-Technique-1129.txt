Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique enabled BlackEnergy to bypass the signed driver requirement in Windows after exploiting a MS Office document using CVE-2014-1761. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that CVE-2014-1761 refers to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows remote code execution. So, the initial attack vector is through a malicious document that exploits this vulnerability, giving the attacker initial access to the system.

Now, the question is about what technique BlackEnergy used next to defeat the signed driver requirement. I remember that signed drivers in Windows are typically required for certain operations, especially in the context of kernel-level access. Bypassing this would allow the attacker to perform actions that are usually restricted without proper signing.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application. This technique is about exploiting public-facing applications, which might not directly relate to bypassing signed drivers. It's more about gaining access through known vulnerabilities in applications.

B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. This sounds relevant because it involves manipulating or bypassing mechanisms that control elevation, like using techniques to gain higher privileges. If BlackEnergy used this, they might have found a way to elevate their privileges, which could include bypassing signed driver requirements.

C: T1078.003-Local Accounts. This is about using local user accounts, which might be a step in initial access but doesn't directly relate to bypassing signed drivers.

D: T1518-Software Discovery. This is about identifying and enumerating software on the system, which could be part of post-exploitation but again, not directly about bypassing signed drivers.

So, focusing on T1548, I recall that this technique involves things like exploiting or bypassing mechanisms that control elevation, such as using tools like mimikatz to dump credentials or using certain exploit kits. If BlackEnergy used this, they might have used it to gain higher privileges, which could include running unsigned drivers because they now have the necessary permissions.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism.
</think>

The correct answer is B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Exploit**: The attack starts with CVE-2014-1761, which allows remote code execution via a malicious Office document, granting initial access to the system.

2. **Elevation of Privilege**: To bypass the signed driver requirement, BlackEnergy would need to elevate its privileges. This is where T1548 comes into play, as it involves techniques to manipulate or bypass mechanisms controlling privilege escalation.

3. **Bypassing Signed Drivers**: With elevated privileges, the attacker can perform actions that would normally require signed drivers, such as loading unsigned drivers, thus evading detection.

**Final Answer: B**
