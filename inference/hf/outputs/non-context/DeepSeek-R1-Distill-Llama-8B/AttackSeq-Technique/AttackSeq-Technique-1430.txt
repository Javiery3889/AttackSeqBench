Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique InkySquid used after they disguised exploit code and restricted access to it. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that InkySquid disguised exploit code within legitimate code. That makes me think about how they're evading detection. Disguising code is often done through techniques like obfuscation or encryption, which is part of T1001, Data Obfuscation. So that's a possible candidate.

Next, they restricted access to the exploit code, which suggests they're controlling access, maybe through some kind of access control. Looking at the options, T1102-Web Service might fit here because web services often have layers of access controls. Alternatively, T1218.014-MMC (Microsoft Management Console) could be about accessing management interfaces, but I'm not sure if that's the best fit here.

Wait, the question also mentions leveraging cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API. Microsoft Graph API is a service that provides programmatic access to Microsoft services, so maybe they're using it to access or control something. T1102-Web Service is about accessing web services, which could include APIs. So that might be the right choice.

But I'm a bit confused between T1102 and T1218.014. T1218.014 is about accessing the Microsoft Management Console, which is more about managing systems through Microsoft's console, not necessarily using their APIs. So T1102 seems more appropriate for accessing services via APIs.

So putting it together, after evading detection by obfuscating the code and controlling access, using a web service like Microsoft Graph API would make sense. Therefore, the answer is T1102-Web Service.

The most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is T1102-Web Service. After disguising the exploit code and restricting access, InkySquid likely leveraged a web service, such as Microsoft Graph API, to maintain access and control over their operations.

Final Answer: A: T1102-Web Service
