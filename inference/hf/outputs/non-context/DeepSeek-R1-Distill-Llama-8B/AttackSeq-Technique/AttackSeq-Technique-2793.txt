Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used to send sensitive data from an iOS device. The question says that the attacker collected things like text messages, contact lists, and location data. Then, they encoded this information into Base64 tokens with a random prefix. 

First, I need to recall what each of these techniques does. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: T1614-System Location Discovery. I think this is about gathering location data from a device. So, if the attacker got the location data, maybe they used this technique. But the question is about sending the data out, not just collecting it. So maybe not this one.

Option B: T1132-Data Encoding. This sounds relevant because the question mentions encoding the data into Base64 tokens. Base64 is a data encoding format, so this technique would involve converting the data into a specific format for transmission. That fits the description.

Option C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting. I'm not too sure about this one. Domain fronting is about controlling a domain name resolution process, maybe for phishing or redirecting traffic. Doesn't seem directly related to encoding data for sending out.

Option D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools. This is about compromising software or tools used in development. Maybe if they used a tool to send data, but the question is about encoding the data, so this might not be the right fit.

Putting it all together, the attacker collected the data and then encoded it using Base64. So the technique used would be T1132-Data Encoding. That makes sense because encoding is the step after collection for exfiltration.

The correct answer is B: T1132-Data Encoding, as it involves encoding the collected data into Base64 tokens for transmission.

Final Answer: B
