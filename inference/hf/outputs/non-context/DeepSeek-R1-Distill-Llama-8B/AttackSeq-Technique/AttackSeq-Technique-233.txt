Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used here. The question says that after executing a batch file from a decoded CAB file, the malware installs the main payload without triggering a UAC pop-up. Let me break this down.

First, I know that UAC is User Account Control, and it's a security feature in Windows that asks for admin rights when certain operations are performed. So, if the payload is being installed without UAC, the malware must be evading this mechanism somehow.

Looking at the options:

A: T1566-Phishing. Phishing is about tricking users into giving up info, but I don't see how that would directly bypass UAC. It's more about social engineering, not about process elevation.

B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. This sounds relevant because it's about bypassing UAC. I remember that some techniques involve manipulating the UAC settings or exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges without the user's consent.

C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs. This technique involves loading malicious DLLs at the start of a process. If a malicious DLL is injected early, it might modify how processes start, potentially bypassing UAC by running with higher privileges.

D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data. This is about purchasing something, maybe through a supply chain attack. Doesn't seem related to process elevation.

So, the key here is that the payload is installed without UAC. The most likely way is to either abuse the elevation control mechanism or use AppInit DLLs to gain higher privileges. T1548 is about bypassing UAC, which would prevent the pop-up. T1546.010 is about DLL injection, which might also help in privilege escalation.

Wait, but which one is more likely? T1548 is specifically about abusing the elevation control mechanism, which could involve techniques like token manipulation or exploiting UAC's own mechanisms. T1546.010 is more about DLL injection, which might not directly prevent UAC but could be used in conjunction with other techniques.

I think T1548 is more directly related to bypassing UAC, so the answer is B.
</think>

The correct answer is B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** The question describes a scenario where a payload is installed without a UAC pop-up. This indicates that the malware is evading UAC prompts, suggesting the use of a technique to bypass User Account Control.

2. **Analyzing the Techniques:**
   - **T1566-Phishing (A):** Relates to social engineering, not directly related to UAC bypass.
   - **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (B):** Focuses on bypassing UAC, which aligns with the scenario.
   - **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs (C):** Involves DLL injection, which might assist in privilege escalation but isn't the direct method for UAC bypass.
   - **T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data (D):** Relates to supply chain attacks, not relevant here.

3. **Conclusion:** T1548 is specifically about bypassing UAC, making it the most plausible technique used to avoid the UAC pop-up.

**Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
