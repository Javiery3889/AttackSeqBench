Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the app in question is likely to use encryption for its C2 channel before uploading files via FTP. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the app collects information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. That makes me think the app is gathering a lot of sensitive personal data. So, the attacker probably wants to protect this data while sending it back to their command and control (C2) server. Using encryption would make sense here because it would secure the data during transmission, preventing unauthorized access.

Next, the app is performing routines on the iOS device. I'm not entirely sure what these routines entail, but they could involve activities like data extraction, encryption, or other malicious actions. If the app is extracting sensitive data, encrypting it before sending it out would be a logical next step to protect the data from being intercepted.

Now, the question is specifically about using encryption for the C2 channel. FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is an unencrypted protocol, which means data sent over FTP isn't secure. If the attacker were using FTP without encryption, the data could be intercepted by anyone on the network, which is a big security risk. So, using encryption would counteract that vulnerability.

Putting it all together, the app is collecting sensitive data and performing routines, which likely includes encrypting the data before sending it via FTP. Without encryption, the data would be exposed, which isn't in the attacker's best interest. Therefore, the app is probably using encryption for its C2 channel to protect the data during transmission.

The app collects sensitive data and performs routines, indicating a need for encryption to protect data transmission. Since FTP is unencrypted, using encryption is likely to secure the data during C2 communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
