Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware will use sideloading techniques after connecting back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog.org. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that when malware establishes a connection back to a command and control (C2) server, it's usually part of its communication process. The C2 server is used to receive commands and instructions from the attacker. So in this case, the domain pic.nicklockluckydog.org is acting as a C2 server.

Now, the question is whether the malware will then use sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL. Sideloading typically refers to the process where malicious code is loaded into a legitimate process or program. This is often done to avoid detection because the malicious code runs under the guise of a trusted application.

I remember that some malware uses C2 communication to receive instructions. Once it's connected, it might download additional components or scripts. DLLs are a common way to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. So, if the malware is using a C2 server, it's plausible that it would download a malicious DLL to sideload into a process.

Evasion techniques are also part of this. By using sideloading, the malware can avoid certain detection methods because it's not just dropping standalone executables but instead injecting code into existing processes. This makes it harder for antivirus or other tools to detect the malicious activity.

Looking at the answer choices, A says "Yes" and B says "No." Based on the reasoning, it seems likely that the malware would use sideloading after connecting to the C2 server to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion techniques. So the answer should be A.

The malware connecting to the C2 server likely uses sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL, which helps in evading detection. 

Final Answer: A
