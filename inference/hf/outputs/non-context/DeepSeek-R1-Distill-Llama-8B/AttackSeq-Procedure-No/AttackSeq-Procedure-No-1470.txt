Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether BlackEnergy 3 uses Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on a network through employee-enabled macro execution. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that BlackEnergy is a malware family associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs). These groups are known for their sophisticated tactics, often using various methods to infiltrate and maintain access to a network. The question mentions that after reconnaissance, which includes gathering public info and active discovery, the malware uses employee-enabled macro execution to install itself. 

I remember that macro execution typically involves macros in documents, like Word or Excel files, which can execute code when opened or when certain actions are taken. Malware can be embedded in these files and triggered by macros. Now, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a common reference for cyber threats, I think about the tactics and techniques used by APTs.

BlackEnergy 3, if I recall correctly, is known to use various methods to spread, including phishing emails with malicious attachments. Once an email is opened, it might trigger a macro that executes malicious code. Since the question mentions employee-enabled macro execution, that means the infection happens because an employee inadvertently opens a document that has a macro, leading to the installation of the BlackEnergy 3 implant.

Now, about the payload execution. After being installed, how does BlackEnergy 3 deliver its payloads? I think that once the initial infection is established, the malware might use various methods to execute payloads. Ruby is a scripting language, and it's possible that BlackEnergy 3 could use Ruby scripts for certain stages of its operation. Ruby is commonly used in scripting for various purposes, including network attacks, so it's plausible that it's used here.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether it's "likely" that BlackEnergy 3 uses Ruby scripts after being installed through macro execution. Since the initial infection is via macro, and given the nature of APTs using diverse tactics, using Ruby scripts as part of the payload delivery seems plausible. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The question asks whether BlackEnergy 3 uses Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed via employee-enabled macro execution. 

1. **Understanding the Context**: BlackEnergy 3 is associated with APTs, known for using various methods, including phishing and macro execution, to infiltrate networks.
2. **Macro Execution**: Malware can be embedded in documents, and macros can trigger their execution when files are opened or specific actions are taken.
3. **Ruby Scripts**: Ruby is a scripting language used in various cyber operations, including payload delivery. BlackEnergy 3's use of Ruby for payload execution is plausible given its adaptability.
4. **Conclusion**: Based on the nature of APTs and the methods used, it's likely that BlackEnergy 3 uses Ruby scripts post-infection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
