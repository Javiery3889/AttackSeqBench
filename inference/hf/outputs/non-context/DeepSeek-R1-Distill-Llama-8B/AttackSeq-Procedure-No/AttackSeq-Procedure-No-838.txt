Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT28 would install and execute a VBA script like vba_macro.exe to drop malware such as FONTCACHE.DAT before using tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT28 is a group known for their cyber espionage activities. They often use spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access into target networks. Spear-phishing is a common tactic where they send targeted emails with malicious attachments, like documents, to trick employees into opening them. These attachments can be .doc, .xls, or other file types, and sometimes they use VBA scripts embedded in these documents.

So, when a user opens a document with a VBA macro, it can execute code that does various things. One of those things could be dropping malware. FONTCACHE.DAT is a known malicious file that APT28 has used before. It's used to collect credentials and other sensitive information, which helps them move laterally within the network.

After dropping FONTCACHE.DAT, APT28 would likely use other tools to further their objectives. Tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE are all part of their arsenal. CHOPSTICK is used for exfiltration, EVILTOSS for credential dumping, and SOURFACE for lateral movement. These tools help them gather more data and expand their access within the network.

So putting it all together, the sequence would be: spear-phishing with VBA scripts to drop malware (FONTCACHE.DAT), then using other tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE. This makes sense because each step builds on the previous one, enabling APT28 to gain initial access, expand their presence, and carry out their espionage activities.

I don't see any reasons to think this wouldn't happen. APT28's modus operandi aligns with this sequence, so the answer should be yes.

The sequence described aligns with APT28's known tactics. They use spear-phishing to deliver VBA scripts that drop malware like FONTCACHE.DAT, followed by using tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE for further operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
