Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether malicious documents are likely delivered through Initial Access after macros are enabled, especially when campaigns use obfuscation tools and bypass AppLocker. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Initial Access often refers to the first point of entry into a system. Malware developers use various tactics to get their payload into a system. In this case, the question mentions that macros are enabled, which is a common way for malicious actors to execute code from documents like Word or Excel files. So, the initial access might be through these documents.

The question also mentions that these campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools. Obfuscation techniques make it harder to detect malicious code by hiding it within legitimate-looking files or using encryption. This makes the initial access phase more stealthy.

AppLocker is a security tool that restricts certain applications based on their reputation. Bypassing AppLocker would mean that the malicious code can run even if it's detected as a potentially unwanted application. So, using tools to bypass AppLocker would help the attackers gain initial access without being blocked.

Putting this together, the sequence would likely involve enabling macros in a document, which then executes malicious code. The obfuscation would help in delivering this document without being easily detected, and bypassing AppLocker would ensure that the document's malicious content isn't blocked by the system's restrictions.

So, the answer should be yes, it's likely that payloads are delivered through malicious documents in Initial Access after these tactics are used.

The sequence of TTPs described aligns with known tactics used by cyber adversaries. Enabling macros in documents allows for initial execution, obfuscation makes detection harder, and bypassing AppLocker ensures the payload isn't blocked. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
