Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Bankshot implant will use a COM object to execute queries after being dropped via a malicious Word document using the Adobe Flash exploit CVE-2018-4878. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the initial access is through spear phishing emails with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit, specifically CVE-2018-4878. I remember that CVE-2018-4878 is a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that allowed attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the software, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. So, when the user opens the malicious document, the exploit is triggered, and the attacker gains initial access.

Now, the question is about what happens after that. The Bankshot implant is mentioned, which I think is a type of malware used in attacks. I'm not entirely sure about its specifics, but I recall that some implants use different mechanisms to interact with the system once they're installed. One common method is using COM objects because they can interact with the Windows environment, allowing the implant to perform various tasks like gathering information or executing commands.

So, the attack sequence starts with the exploit dropping the implant, which is the Bankshot. Once the implant is on the system, it needs to perform actions, like gathering system information. Using a COM object would be a plausible way to do that because COM objects can be used to call Windows APIs or interact with system functions without the need for higher privileges, which might be a concern if the implant is running with a lower privilege level.

I'm trying to think if there are other ways the implant could gather information. Maybe through scripting or using built-in functions, but COM objects are a common technique in some implants for this purpose. They can also help in persistence or lateral movement within the network if the implant needs to communicate with other systems.

I don't have specific knowledge about Bankshot's exact methods, but given that it's a known implant, it's likely designed to use various techniques to stay undetected and gather information. Using a COM object would be a standard approach for such implants to interact with the system environment.

So, putting it all together, after the initial exploit drops the Bankshot implant, it's probable that it would use a COM object to execute queries and gather system information. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The initial attack uses a spear phishing email with an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) to gain access. The Bankshot implant is then deployed. Given that implants often use COM objects for system interaction, it's likely the implant will utilize this method to gather information.

Final Answer: A: Yes
