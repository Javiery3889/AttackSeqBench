Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Yellow Garuda, after collecting data from Telegram, divides the data into fixed-size chunks to exfiltrate them to avoid detection. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Yellow Garuda is using a 'grabber' tool to collect data from Telegram accounts. The data collected includes messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. The question is about whether this data is split into fixed-size chunks before being sent out to evade detection.

I remember that cyber attackers often use various techniques to avoid being detected. One common method is data fragmentation, where data is split into smaller pieces. This is usually done to make it harder for security tools to detect the exfiltration. Fixed-size chunks are a type of fragmentation technique where the data is divided into parts of a specific, predictable size. This can help in bypassing certain detection mechanisms because each chunk might not immediately raise a red flag on its own.

Another thing I recall is that the MITRE ATT&CK framework talks about techniques like Data Fragmentation, which is technique T1003.001. This technique involves splitting data into smaller, more manageable pieces to avoid detection. So, if Yellow Garuda is using a tool that collects data and then splits it, that would fit into this category.

Also, using a 'grabber' tool suggests that the data is being collected in one go, but if it's then split into fixed chunks, it's a way to make the data transfer less noticeable. Each chunk might be sent separately, making it harder for security systems to spot the exfiltration as a single, large transfer.

I don't see any information in the question that would suggest they're not using this method. There's no mention of encryption or other methods like encryption, which is another common evasion technique, but the question specifically asks about fixed-size chunks, so I should focus on that.

So, putting it all together, it's likely that Yellow Garuda would use fixed-size chunks to exfiltrate the data to avoid detection. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The data collected by Yellow Garuda is likely divided into fixed-size chunks to evade detection. This method, known as data fragmentation (T1003.001), is a common technique used to make exfiltration harder to detect by splitting data into smaller, less suspicious pieces.

Final Answer: A: Yes
