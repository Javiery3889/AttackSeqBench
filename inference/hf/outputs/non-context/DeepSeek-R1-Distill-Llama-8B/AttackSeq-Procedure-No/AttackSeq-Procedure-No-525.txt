Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor would download encoded blobs that are then decoded into PowerShell command-line scripts for defense evasion. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Dropping Elephant is a known malware family, often used by APT29, which is linked to attacks like the SolarWinds attack. From what I've read, Dropping Elephant is a modular loader that can drop various payloads, including other malware, ransomware, and payloads like Cobalt Strike beams.

The question mentions a file-stealer module that iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions. So, the initial action is about exfiltration or data collection. The file-stealer is probably gathering sensitive data, maybe credentials or other files, which are then used for further attacks.

Now, the question is about whether the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant would download encoded blobs. I think that in some cases, malware uses encoding techniques to evade detection. For example, they might encode their command-line arguments or other data using a simple cipher so that when they're captured, they don't make sense unless decoded.

So, if the backdoor is used to download these encoded blobs, the idea is that when these blobs are retrieved, they need to be decoded to become something useful, like a PowerShell script. PowerShell is a common tool for scripting, so it makes sense that the decoded blobs would be scripts.

I recall that some malware uses this technique to bypass detection. For instance, if a process is running with a command-line argument that's encoded, it might look like garbage to security tools, but when decoded, it's a legitimate-looking command. This is a form of defense evasion because the command isn't easily identifiable as malicious until it's decoded.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: the file-stealer collects files, the backdoor (Dropping Elephant) uses those files or the collected data to download encoded blobs, which are then decoded into PowerShell scripts. This would allow the attacker to execute malicious scripts without them being immediately obvious, thus evading some defenses.

So, the answer should be yes, it's likely that the backdoor would do this.

The sequence of events aligns with known tactics used by Dropping Elephant malware. After collecting files, the backdoor likely downloads encoded blobs which, when decoded, become PowerShell scripts for defense evasion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
