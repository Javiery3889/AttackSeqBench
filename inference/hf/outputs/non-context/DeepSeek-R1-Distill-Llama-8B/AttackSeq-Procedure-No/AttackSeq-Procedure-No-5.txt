Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether recipients who receive a document that looks like a legitimate blog post or report are likely to get spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery after they get infected with QuasarRAT. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The question is about the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in a cyber attack. The initial step is that recipients receive a document that appears legitimate, which is a common tactic in phishing. Phishing often uses social engineering to trick people into interacting with malicious content.

The document might be a blog post or report, which is a common medium for phishing because it's something people are likely to engage with, thinking it's relevant or important. Once the user interacts with it, especially if it's a document, it could lead to a drive-by download, where the user is directed to a website or file without their knowledge.

The next part is about the specific exploit mentioned: CVE-2017-8750. I'm not exactly sure what that is, so I should look it up. From what I recall, CVE-2017-8750 is a vulnerability related to Microsoft Office. It's a remote code execution vulnerability that was exploited in documents. So, if the document is a malicious RTF file, it could exploit this vulnerability to drop a payload, which in this case is QuasarRAT.

QuasarRAT is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allows an attacker to take control of a victim's system. Once installed, it can perform various malicious activities, like keylogging, data exfiltration, or further distribution of malware.

So the sequence would be: Phishing email or document → User interaction leading to a malicious RTF document → Exploit of CVE-2017-8750 → Delivery of QuasarRAT → Infection → Potential follow-up attacks.

Now, the question is whether after getting infected with QuasarRAT, the recipients would receive spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750. Spear phishing is targeted, so after being infected, the attacker might use the access gained from QuasarRAT to send more targeted emails, possibly using the same or similar tactics.

But wait, once QuasarRAT is installed, the attacker might not need to send more phishing emails because the RAT can be used to control the system remotely. However, sometimes attackers use multiple stages. They might first deliver the RAT via a document exploit and then use it to distribute more malicious content or perform further attacks.

Alternatively, the initial infection could be via the RTF document, which then drops QuasarRAT. Once QuasarRAT is active, the attacker could use it to send more phishing emails, possibly using the same or different TTPs.

So, the sequence would be: Initial phishing document → Exploit → QuasarRAT infection → Use of QuasarRAT to send more phishing emails, possibly with similar or other exploits.

Therefore, it's plausible that after getting QuasarRAT, they would receive more spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 or other vulnerabilities, as part of the attack chain.

So the answer would be A: Yes.
</think>

The sequence begins with a phishing email or document, which tricks recipients into interacting with a malicious RTF file. This RTF exploits CVE-2017-8750, a Microsoft Office vulnerability, to deliver QuasarRAT, a RAT that grants attackers remote control over the system. Once QuasarRAT is active, it can be used to send targeted spear phishing emails, potentially using similar tactics, continuing the attack cycle.

Final Answer: A
