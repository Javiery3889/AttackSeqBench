Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the Dropping Elephant is a known malware family associated with various cyber espionage activities. It's often used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, so it's likely to have sophisticated capabilities.

The question mentions that the malware evades defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts. This suggests that the initial phase involves some form of script execution, possibly using PowerShell because it's a common tool for malicious activities due to its flexibility and accessibility.

Now, the main question is whether this particular Dropping Elephant variant is designed to target browser cookies, specifically from Google Chrome and Apple Safari. I recall that browser cookies are a valuable commodity for cyber actors because they can be used for session hijacking, unauthorized access to accounts, or monetization through advertising networks.

Looking at the behavior described, the malware is using PowerShell scripts to download additional malware. This could mean that after the initial infection, the malware is fetching more malicious code or tools. If the next step is to steal cookies, the malware would need to interact with the browser to extract cookies. This might involve either directly accessing the browser's storage or using browser extension APIs.

I also remember that some malware uses browser-based attacks to inject scripts into legitimate websites or into the browser's process space. This could allow them to capture cookies as the user interacts with the web.

Another angle is that the malware might be using browser helper objects (BHOs) or browser extensions to gain persistence and access to cookies. Alternatively, it might be using browser's built-in functions to read cookies, perhaps through the "browser: " protocol or by interacting with the Windows Registry to access cookie storage locations.

I should also consider whether the specific variant of Dropping Elephant known for this behavior. From what I've read, some variants of Dropping Elephant do have capabilities to target browser cookies, especially from Chrome and Safari, as these are widely used and valuable. They might use techniques like hooking into the browser's cookie storage or using web proxies to capture cookie data as it's transmitted.

Additionally, the use of PowerShell suggests that the malware is written by someone familiar with it, which aligns with APT groups who often use such tools for their operations. The ability to decode and execute scripts indicates a level of sophistication, which is consistent with cookie theft as a follow-up action after initial payload delivery.

I don't recall any specific information that would indicate that Dropping Elephant avoids targeting browser cookies, especially given the high value of browser-based credentials. Therefore, it's plausible that after evading initial defenses, the malware would proceed to steal cookies from the browsers installed on the machine.
</think>

The Dropping Elephant malware, known for its association with advanced persistent threat groups, is likely to steal browser cookies after using PowerShell scripts to evade defenses. This is because browser cookies are highly valuable for session hijacking and account access. The malware's use of PowerShell suggests a sophisticated approach, aligning with APT groups' capabilities. Given its known behaviors and the value of cookies, it's plausible that this variant would target both Google Chrome and Apple Safari cookies.

Final Answer: A: Yes
