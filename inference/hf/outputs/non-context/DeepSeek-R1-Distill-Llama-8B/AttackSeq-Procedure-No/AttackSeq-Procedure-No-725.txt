Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Stuxnet would exploit the MS08-067 and MS10-061 vulnerabilities after communicating with its C&C servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Stuxnet is a well-known worm that targeted Iranian oil refineries. It's a sophisticated piece of malware, so it probably uses various tactics and techniques to achieve its objectives. The question mentions that it communicates with C&C servers using encrypted channels. That makes sense because encrypted communication is a common practice for malware to avoid detection and to securely receive commands or updates.

Now, the main point here is whether Stuxnet would then use the MS08-067 and MS10-061 vulnerabilities for lateral movement. I remember that these are Windows vulnerabilities related to the Print Spooler service. MS08-067 allows an attacker to take control of a compromised machine by exploiting a vulnerability in the Print Spooler service, while MS10-061 is another Print Spooler vulnerability that was discovered later. These are both remote code execution vulnerabilities, which can be used for lateral movement within a network once an initial infection has been established.

Stuxnet, being a worm, would likely spread across a network once it's inside a system. It needs to move laterally to infect more machines. Using these vulnerabilities makes sense because they can help it spread from one compromised system to another without needing user interaction, which is a characteristic of a worm.

I also recall that Stuxnet was designed to spread across networks, so it would use various methods, including these vulnerabilities, to propagate. The fact that it communicates with C&C servers suggests it's a centrally controlled malware, which would need to manage its spread and operations across multiple infected machines.

So, putting it all together, after establishing a connection with its command and control, it's plausible that Stuxnet would exploit these Print Spooler vulnerabilities to move laterally through the network, infecting more systems and causing further damage.

The analysis indicates that Stuxnet, after communicating with its C&C servers, would likely exploit the MS08-067 and MS10-061 vulnerabilities to achieve lateral movement within the network. These vulnerabilities, related to the Print Spooler service, are well-suited for remote code execution, enabling the worm to spread across multiple systems without user interaction, aligning with its nature as a network-aware malware.

Final Answer: A: Yes
