Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether an adversary would split files larger than 1,000,000 bytes before exfiltrating them from Microsoft SharePoint Online. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that when adversaries are exfiltrating data, they often have to deal with size limitations. SharePoint Online has file size limits, right? I think the standard limit is 2GB per file, but sometimes it can be higher depending on the plan. So if a file is 1MB (1,000,000 bytes), that's well under 2GB, so maybe they don't need to split it. But wait, sometimes even if a file is under the limit, splitting might be necessary for other reasons, like avoiding detection or making the data harder to trace.

I remember that the MITRE ATT&CK framework talks about techniques like Data Exfiltration, which can involve splitting data into smaller chunks. Adversaries might split files to bypass size restrictions or to make the data less noticeable. So even if the file is under the size limit, splitting could still be a step they take.

Looking at the question, the adversary has already compressed and encrypted the data, which makes each chunk smaller. Compressing and encrypting reduces the size, so a 1MB file after compression might still be manageable without splitting. But if it's larger than 1MB, maybe they need to split it further to avoid issues during exfiltration.

Wait, but SharePoint Online's limit is higher than 1MB. So if the file is 1MB or more, but after compression and encryption, maybe it's still under 2GB, so they might not need to split it. Or perhaps they do, just to be safe. I'm a bit confused here.

I should think about how data is typically exfiltrated. Sometimes, even if a file is under the limit, splitting it can help in evading detection. For example, if each chunk is smaller, it's harder to notice the exfiltration in logs or network traffic. So even if the file is 1MB, splitting it into smaller parts could be a precaution.

So, putting it all together, the adversary is likely to split the files if they're 1MB or more because it's a common practice to avoid detection and fit within the system's constraints. Therefore, the answer should be yes, they would split the files.

The adversary is likely to split the files if they are 1,000,000 bytes or more before exfiltration. This is because splitting data into smaller chunks is a common technique to avoid detection and fit within system constraints, even if the files are under the size limit.

Final Answer: A: Yes
