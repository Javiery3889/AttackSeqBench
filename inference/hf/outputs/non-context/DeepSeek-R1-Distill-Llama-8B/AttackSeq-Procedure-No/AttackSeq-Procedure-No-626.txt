Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol after the CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question is saying. The CostaRicto Campaign is using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to communicate with their C2 servers. Protocol tunneling usually means that they're using a protocol like DNS or HTTP to disguise their command and control (C2) communications, making it harder for defenders to detect them because these are common, legitimate protocols.

Now, the question is about whether SombRAT, a backdoor, will use HTTPS or SMTPS for exfiltration without using the C2 protocol. Wait, that part is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The question is asking if SombRAT will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. So, they're wondering if SombRAT would use these secure protocols (HTTPS is secure, SMTPS is for email over SSL) without relying on their usual C2 communication method.

I remember that SombRAT is a remote access trojan, which means it's designed to give attackers persistent access to a system. Once installed, it can exfiltrate data, download more malware, or perform other malicious activities. But how does it communicate? Typically, RATs use their own C2 servers to send commands and receive data. So, if the question is about whether SombRAT would use HTTPS or SMTPS without their C2 protocol, that doesn't quite make sense because they usually do use their own C2 for communication.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that the CostaRicto Campaign is using tunneling over DNS and HTTP to communicate with their C2, so perhaps they're using those protocols to hide their C2 traffic. Now, if SombRAT is a backdoor, maybe it's using the same C2 servers as the campaign, or perhaps it's a separate thing. But the question is about whether SombRAT would use HTTPS or SMTPS without using a C2 protocol. That seems contradictory because SombRAT typically uses its own C2.

Alternatively, maybe the question is suggesting that since the campaign is using tunneling over DNS and HTTP, perhaps the backdoor is using those same protocols for exfiltration. But HTTPS is a different protocol altogether, so that might not fit. SMTPS is for email, so maybe they're using it to send data via email, which could be a non-C2 method.

Wait, but the question says "using a non-C2 protocol." So, if the backdoor is using HTTPS or SMTPS, which are not C2 protocols, then the answer would be yes or no. But I'm a bit confused because I thought backdoors like SombRAT use their own C2 for communication. So, if they're using HTTPS or SMTPS, that would be a different method, which might be a non-C2 protocol.

I should think about how these protocols are used. HTTPS is secure and encrypted, so using it for exfiltration would be less likely to be detected. SMTPS is for sending emails securely, so maybe they're using it to send stolen data via email, which could be a way to exfiltrate data without using their usual C2 channels.

But wait, the question is about whether SombRAT would use these protocols without using a C2 protocol. If SombRAT typically uses its own C2, then using HTTPS or SMTPS would be a non-C2 method. So, the answer would be yes, it's likely.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because SombRAT relies on its C2 for communication and wouldn't switch to HTTPS or SMTPS. But I'm not entirely sure. I think the more common answer is that attackers might use different protocols to avoid detection, so they might switch to HTTPS or SMTPS for exfiltration without using their usual C2, hence the answer would be yes.
</think>

The question asks whether SombRAT, a backdoor, would exfiltrate data using HTTPS or SMTPS without relying on its usual C2 protocol. SombRAT typically uses its own C2 for communication, but attackers might switch to other protocols like HTTPS or SMTPS to avoid detection. Therefore, it's plausible that SombRAT would use these secure protocols for exfiltration without its C2.

Final Answer: A: Yes
