Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SBDH malware would incorporate junk data into encoded strings to prevent trivial decoding during network communication with its C&C server under the Command and Control tactic. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that SBDH malware is involved in some kind of data collection. It uses powerful filters to target specific data based on file extension, creation date, and file size. So, the malware is probably gathering files that meet certain criteria, which makes me think it's after sensitive information.

Now, the question is about whether it would add junk data to these collected files. The purpose here seems to be to make the data harder to decode. If the malware includes junk data, it could make the encoded strings less predictable or more complex, which would hinder analysis. This makes sense because adding noise or irrelevant data can mask the actual payload or exfiltration channels.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." I'm leaning towards A because adding junk data is a common tactic in malware to obfuscate and prevent easy decoding. It's a way to make the data look like random or unnecessary information, which can throw off analysts trying to decode the strings.

I don't see any reasons to think it wouldn't do this. Malware often uses such techniques to avoid detection. So, the most plausible answer is A.

The SBDH malware is likely to incorporate junk data into encoded strings to prevent trivial decoding during communication with its C&C server. This tactic aligns with common malware behavior used to obfuscate data and evade detection.

Final Answer: A
