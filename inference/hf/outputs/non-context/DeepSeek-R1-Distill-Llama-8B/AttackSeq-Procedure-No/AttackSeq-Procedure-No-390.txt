Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether threat actors would use a VBA script after leveraging AtomBombing to inject malicious code into a Windows system. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that AtomBombing is a technique used for injecting malicious code into legitimate programs. It's often used in the context of Office documents, like Word or Excel, because these files can be a common way to distribute malware. The idea is that when the document is opened, it triggers the malicious code execution without the user being immediately aware.

So, if the threat actors have used AtomBombing to inject malicious code into a Windows OS, the next logical step would be to find a way to execute this code. VBA scripts are a common method for embedding malicious code within Office documents. VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications, and it's a scripting language used within Office applications like Word. By embedding a VBA macro, the threat actors can trigger the malicious code when the document is opened or when certain actions are performed.

Since AtomBombing and VBA both relate to injecting malicious code into documents, it makes sense that the actors would use VBA as a way to execute the injected code. This would allow the malicious payload to run automatically when the document is accessed, making it a likely next step in their strategy.

I don't see any immediate contradictions here. Both techniques are part of the same category of document-based attacks, so using one doesn't preclude the use of the other. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely they would use a VBA script.

The threat actors are likely to use a VBA script after employing AtomBombing because both techniques are commonly used together in document-based attacks to inject and execute malicious code.

Final Answer: A: Yes
