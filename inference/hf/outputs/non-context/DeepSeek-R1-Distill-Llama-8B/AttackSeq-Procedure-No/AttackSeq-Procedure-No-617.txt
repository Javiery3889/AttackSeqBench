Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails using a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Bankshot implants are mentioned as being developed by the attackers. These implants give them full control over victim systems and the ability to wipe files. So, the initial step is that the attackers have some form of malicious code or tool (Bankshot) that can do these things.

The question is about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack. The attack mentioned is via spear phishing emails, which is a common initial access method. Spear phishing is targeted and specific, so it makes sense that they would use this method to target a specific sector, in this case, Turkish financial organizations.

The malicious document is exploiting CVE-2018-4878. I should recall what this CVE is about. CVE-2018-4878 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office related to how it handles certain document formats. It allows an attacker to execute malicious code when a document is opened or previewed. So, the attackers are using this exploit to gain initial access into the target systems.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the relevant tactics here would be Initial Access, which in this case is via spear phishing. The techniques would be Exploiting a Vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878) and then maybe things like Persistence if they're trying to maintain access, but the question doesn't mention that.

So, the sequence would be: they send a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document. The user opens it, the exploit is triggered, leading to initial access. Once they have access, they can deploy their Bankshot implants to gain full control and wipe files.

Now, considering the answer choices, the question is whether this is likely. Since the attack method is well-documented and the exploit is known, it's plausible that Hidden Cobra would use this approach. They have the capability with Bankshot, so it fits their modus operandi.

I don't see any immediate red flags or reasons why this wouldn't be likely. The exploit is effective, the method is common, and the target is a specific sector which might be attractive for financial motives.

The attack described involves using a known exploit (CVE-2018-4878) through spear phishing to gain initial access, followed by deploying Bankshot implants for further control and file wiping. This aligns with known TTPs of Hidden Cobra, making the scenario plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
