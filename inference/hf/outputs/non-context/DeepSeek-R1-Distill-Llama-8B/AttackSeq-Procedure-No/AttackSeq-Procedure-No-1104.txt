Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke malware captures credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that CosmicDuke is a type of malware associated with the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. From what I remember, Lazarus is known for targeting various industries, including financial institutions, and their malware is designed to gather sensitive information.

The question mentions that CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives for discovery. So, the initial action is about searching through files. Now, the specific part I'm focusing on is whether it captures credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page.

Ivanti Connect Secure is a vulnerability management and threat detection tool. If the login page is manipulated, it might have been altered to capture credentials. Malware like CosmicDuke could potentially intercept or capture credentials during this process.

I recall that some malware can inject themselves into legitimate applications or websites to intercept login information. If the Ivanti Connect Secure login page is compromised, the malware could be designed to capture username and password data as users log in.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Since CosmicDuke is known for credential theft and it's targeting a login page, it's plausible that it captures these credentials. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The malware in question, CosmicDuke, is associated with credential theft. It targets login pages, so capturing credentials on a compromised Ivanti Connect Secure page is likely. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
