Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a cyber campaign that uses obfuscation for a backdoor payload would drop components like invoker.ps1 after initial access, using decoded scripts embedded in a Microsoft Word document via macros. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that when defending against cyber threats, one common technique is to use obfuscation. Obfuscation makes it harder for security tools to detect malicious code by hiding its true nature. So, if a payload is obfuscated, it's likely that it's trying to evade detection.

The question mentions that the campaign uses obfuscation for the backdoor payload. That means the payload is probably hidden or scrambled in a way that makes it look like normal traffic or code. Now, the payload is being delivered through a Microsoft Word document. That's a common vector for phishing or delivering malicious code because Word documents can execute macros, which can then run scripts.

The initial access is gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts in the Word document. So, when the user opens the document, the macro triggers the execution of these scripts. These scripts are encoded, so they haven't been decoded yet, which is why they might be evading detection. Once the scripts are executed, they probably decode the actual payload, which is the backdoor.

After the initial access, the question is whether the campaign would drop components like invoker.ps1. I remember that in some cases, malicious actors use helper scripts or components to establish persistence or further attacks. Invoker.ps1 is a known file that can be used to execute other scripts or commands because it's a legitimate-looking file that doesn't immediately raise alarms.

So, after the initial payload is dropped and executed, it's plausible that the campaign would drop additional scripts or components to maintain access or escalate privileges. These could include scripts that create scheduled tasks, modify system configurations, or set up backdoors for future access. Invoker.ps1 might be one of these components because it's a common tool in certain attack frameworks like the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: encode the payload, embed it in a document, use macros to trigger execution, which decodes the payload, and then drop additional scripts like invoker.ps1 for persistence or further actions. This makes sense because each step is a common tactic in cyberattacks to evade detection and maintain access.

I think the answer is yes, the campaign would use decoded scripts to drop invoker.ps1 after the initial access. So, the correct answer should be A: Yes.

The cyber campaign described uses obfuscation for a backdoor payload, embedded in a Microsoft Word document via macros. Upon execution, the encoded scripts decode to reveal the payload, which is then used to establish initial access. Post-access, it's typical for such campaigns to drop additional components like invoker.ps1 for persistence or further actions, aligning with tactics like establishing a beachhead or lateral movement. This aligns with known adversarial behavior in cyberattacks, making the answer:

Final Answer: A: Yes
