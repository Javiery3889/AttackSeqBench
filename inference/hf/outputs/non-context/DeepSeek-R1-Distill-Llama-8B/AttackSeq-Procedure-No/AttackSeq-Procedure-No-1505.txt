Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether RIG EK's exploit server uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that RIG EK is related to exploit kits, which are used by attackers to distribute malware. These kits often use various techniques to evade detection. The question mentions that RIG EK uses a custom RC4 encryption for its command and control (C2) communications. RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm, so it's good for encrypting data because it's fast and widely used, but it's also known to be vulnerable to certain attacks, which might not be the main point here.

The main point is about proxy servers. Proxies are intermediate servers that handle requests from clients, so using proxies can make it harder to trace the origin of traffic. If RIG EK's exploit server uses proxies, it could mask the source of the traffic, making it harder for security teams to identify where the malicious activities are coming from.

I remember that some cyber attackers use proxy servers to hide their C2 communications. By routing traffic through multiple proxies, they can obfuscate the true source, making it harder for incident response teams to track the attack's origin. This is a common technique in cyber espionage campaigns to avoid detection.

So, putting it together, if RIG EK is using a custom RC4 encryption, it's likely they're also using proxies to add another layer of anonymity and make their operations harder to detect. Therefore, the answer should be yes, proxy servers are used.

The use of a custom RC4 encryption by RIG EK suggests a focus on securing their communications. However, the real question is about the use of proxy servers to evade detection. Proxies can mask traffic origins, aiding in hiding malicious activities. Since RIG EK is known for evading detection, using proxies aligns with their tactics, making it harder to trace their operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
