Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT10 would use remote COM execution with Beacon payloads for lateral movement after using Mimikatz to steal credentials and accessing a Visma AD controller to deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT file. The question is whether they'd use remote COM instead of logging in via Citrix using valid user accounts during Chinese working hours.

First, I need to break down the attack sequence described. APT10 starts by using Mimikatz, which is a tool for credential dumping. So they're likely dumping credentials from the system they've accessed. Then they access Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, which suggests they've obtained some level of access, maybe through the stolen credentials. From there, they deploy Trochilus, which I think is a tool used for extracting the NTDS.DIT file, which contains domain-wide credentials. So now they have access to a lot of domain-wide credentials, which can be used for lateral movement within the network.

Now, the question is whether they'll use remote COM execution with Beacon payloads for moving laterally or if they'll log in via Citrix using valid user accounts, which would be more in line with typical Chinese working hours.

I remember that APT10 is associated with China, specifically with the group known as Bronze Blue, which operates out of China. They often use legitimate but compromised credentials to move laterally within a network. They might use tools like Mimikatz for credential dumping and then use those credentials to access other systems, possibly through remote access tools.

Beacon payloads are part of the Cobalt Strike framework, used for command and control. If they're using remote COM execution, that could mean they're using something like a VNC or RDP to establish a remote session, which would allow them to move laterally without necessarily logging in through the main login methods.

On the other hand, using Citrix servers with valid user accounts would be a more conventional method, but that might be more noticeable if done during working hours because it's a standard login. However, if they're using remote COM, it might be less likely to be detected as easily, especially if it's a legitimate session.

Considering APT10's tactics, they often prefer using legitimate methods to stay under the radar. Using remote COM execution with Beacon could help them move laterally without raising too many alarms, whereas using Citrix during working hours might be more likely to be monitored or noticed by security teams.

So putting it together, after accessing the AD controller and deploying Trochilus, it's plausible that APT10 would use remote COM execution with Beacon payloads for lateral movement instead of using the more conventional Citrix login method. Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

The analysis suggests that APT10 would use remote COM execution with Beacon payloads for lateral movement after accessing the Visma network. This method is less likely to be detected compared to using Citrix logins, which might be more noticeable during working hours. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
