Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access. The question mentions that someone ran cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor and communicated with a C&C server via HTTPS. I need to determine if this indicates Initial Access via exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities.

First, I should recall what SparrowDoor is. From what I remember, SparrowDoor is a malware family known for targeting Windows systems. It's often used in supply chain attacks, like the SolarWinds attack. It uses legitimate signed binaries to bypass detection, which makes it tricky to spot.

The question says that SparrowDoor was executed via cmd.exe. That makes me think it's using a common Windows utility, which could be a red flag because cmd.exe is often used in malicious activities. Also, communication with a C&C server via HTTPS suggests that the malware is establishing a secure command and control channel, which is a typical behavior to avoid detection.

Now, Initial Access in the MITRE ATT&CK framework usually refers to how an attacker first gains access to a system. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities, phishing, or other means. Since SparrowDoor is known for exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities, especially in internet-facing applications, it's likely that this is the method used here.

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. I think the key points are the use of cmd.exe for execution and the encrypted communication. Both of these are indicators of malicious activity, especially since cmd.exe is a common tool for executing malicious code. The HTTPS part might be to avoid detection by avoiding plain text traffic, which is a common tactic.

So, putting it all together, the sequence described fits with SparrowDoor exploiting remote code execution in internet-facing apps for Initial Access. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The scenario describes the execution of SparrowDoor via cmd.exe and communication with a C&C server using HTTPS, both of which are indicators of malicious activity. SparrowDoor is known for exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities, aligning with Initial Access in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Final Answer: A: Yes
