Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant, after performing initial reconnaissance by decrypting network and system information, would communicate with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Rising Sun is a known implant used by APT29, a group linked to various cyberattacks. From what I remember, APT29's tactics often involve using various methods to gather intelligence and establish command and control (C2) channels. 

The question mentions that Rising Sun did initial reconnaissance by decrypting network and system information. So, the initial phase is about gathering data. Now, the next part is about communication methods. I'm trying to recall if they use blogs or WordPress for C2.

I think that APT29 typically uses more sophisticated methods for communication. They often use encrypted communication channels, like encrypted emails or custom protocols. Blogs and WordPress might not be the primary method because they're more public and less secure. Also, using blogs for C2 could be risky because it's not as stealthy and could be easier to detect.

Wait, but sometimes they might use proxies or other methods to communicate through less direct means. However, I don't recall WordPress being a common tool for C2. It's more of a content management system and might not be the best for secret communication. Plus, using blogs would require the implant to have access to the blog's system, which might not be the case here.

So, putting it together, after initial reconnaissance, Rising Sun is more likely to use encrypted and more secure channels rather than public platforms like blogs or WordPress. Therefore, the answer is probably "No."

The Rising Sun implant, used by APT29, typically employs sophisticated and secure communication methods rather than public platforms like blogs or WordPress. These methods include encrypted channels and custom protocols, making the use of WordPress for C2 communication unlikely.

Final Answer: B: No
