Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether attackers would switch to using images in phishing emails after verifying credentials and prompting for a 2-step verification code. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that attackers often use phishing emails to gather sensitive information. They might start by sending an email that looks legitimate, maybe from a known company or service, to trick the victim into revealing their credentials. Once they have the credentials, they can access accounts or systems.

But the question says that after verifying the credentials in real-time, they prompt for a 2-step verification code. Wait, that seems a bit off. Usually, 2-step verification is an additional security measure, so if the attacker already has the password, why would they need a 2-step code? Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the attacker is trying to bypass the 2-step verification by using the already obtained credentials. Or maybe the 2-step code is part of their process to access something else.

Now, the next part is about using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. I remember that email systems like Gmail or Google's security filters often look for text-based phishing indicators. Images can sometimes bypass these filters because they're less likely to be flagged as suspicious, especially if the images contain legitimate-looking content or are obfuscated in a way that's hard to detect.

So, if the attackers have already verified the victim's credentials, maybe they're planning to use images in their next phase. They might be trying to avoid detection by using images that don't trigger the same security alerts as text-based emails. This could be a way to evade detection by Google's security systems, which might not scan images as thoroughly or might not recognize them as phishing attempts as quickly.

Alternatively, maybe using images is part of a different tactic, like embedding malicious links or code within the image, which can be harder to detect. Or perhaps they're using images to deliver malware or further instructions that are more stealthy.

I'm a bit confused about the initial part where they verify credentials and then prompt for a 2-step code. Maybe the 2-step code is part of their own process to access something, but then they switch to using images in their phishing emails to avoid detection. It seems a bit disjointed, but I think the key point is that using images can help evade detection systems, so the answer would be yes, they would use images instead of text.
</think>

The attackers, after verifying credentials and prompting for a 2-step verification code, would likely switch to using images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. This is because images are less likely to be flagged by email filters, helping them avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
