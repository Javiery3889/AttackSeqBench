Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Infamous Chisel would automatically exfiltrate files using Tor hidden services after deploying tcpdump to scrape credential-containing files. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that tcpdump is a tool used for packet capture, so deploying it would mean capturing network traffic. The question mentions that these files contain credentials, which are sensitive information. So, the attacker would have access to these credentials.

Now, Infamous Chisel is a tool I'm less familiar with. I think it's related to credential dumping. Maybe it's used to extract credentials from systems. So, if someone has credentials, they can use tools like Chisel to access more data.

The question is about whether Chisel would automatically use Tor hidden services to exfiltrate the collected files. Tor hidden services are used for anonymity, so if an attacker wants to send data without being traced, they might use Tor.

The attack sequence mentioned is: deploying tcpdump, then using Chisel to exfiltrate. So, after getting the credentials, the next logical step would be to transfer the data. Using Tor makes sense because it's a common method for exfiltration to avoid detection.

I'm not sure if Chisel inherently uses Tor, but it's a possibility. Alternatively, the attacker might use other methods, but Tor is a likely choice for anonymity. So, the answer would be yes, it's likely.

The attacker first deploys tcpdump to capture credentials, then uses Chisel to exfiltrate data. Tor hidden services are a common method for transferring data discreetly, making it a likely choice for the attacker.

Final Answer: A: Yes
