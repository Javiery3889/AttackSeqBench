Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the 'stopedge.bat' script is used to delete files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to evade detection before 'versioninfo.bat' runs and collects info for exfiltration. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each of these files does. 'versioninfo.bat' is a script that typically collects system information. It's often used by attackers to gather details about the compromised system, which can then be used for further attacks or exfiltration. So, if an attacker wants to prevent this script from running or deleting its traces, they might use another script to delete these files.

Now, 'stopedge.bat' is mentioned as the script in question. The name suggests it's meant to stop or handle something, possibly related to edge cases or specific processes. If it's used to delete 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs', it would act as an evasive action. The idea here is that by deleting these files before they can execute, the system can avoid detection.

But wait, how does this sequence work? If 'stopedge.bat' runs first, it would delete the other two files. Then, when 'versioninfo.bat' is executed, it wouldn't find the necessary files and might not function properly. However, I'm not sure if 'versioninfo.bat' is run after 'stopedge.bat' or if they are run simultaneously. If 'versioninfo.bat' runs first, then 'stopedge.bat' wouldn't have a chance to delete the files, making the evasive action ineffective.

Also, in many cyberattacks, the kill chain follows a specific order. Attackers often deploy initial payloads to establish a foothold, then move laterally, and finally exfiltrate data. So, if 'versioninfo.bat' is part of the initial phase, 'stopedge.bat' would need to run before it to delete the files. But if 'versioninfo.bat' is part of a later phase, like data collection for exfiltration, then 'stopedge.bat' would run just before that phase to clean up traces.

Another angle is the detection aspect. If 'versioninfo.bat' is used for exfiltration, it's possible that it's run after other stages, so 'stopedge.bat' would be used to remove any evidence before 'versioninfo.bat' can execute. This makes sense because it's a common tactic to cover tracks by deleting potential evidence before it's discovered.

I'm also thinking about how these scripts might be executed. If 'stopedge.bat' is part of a batch file payload, it could be executed in the same droplet as 'versioninfo.bat', but the order matters. If 'stopedge.bat' runs first, it deletes the files, making 'versioninfo.bat' ineffective. If it runs after, it's too late.

In terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, TTPs like these would fall under tactics like Data Collection (T0008) and Discovery (T0000). So, using 'stopedge.bat' to delete these files would be a defensive or evasive action, which is part of the adversary's tactics to avoid detection.

Putting it all together, it seems plausible that 'stopedge.bat' is used to delete 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' before they can execute and collect data, thus evading detection. Therefore, the answer is likely Yes.

The 'stopedge.bat' script is designed to delete 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to prevent them from executing and gathering system information, which would otherwise aid in detection. This sequence makes sense as an evasive tactic, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's data collection and discovery tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
