Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT15 would use valid account information to access networks via VPN instead of deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT15 is a group known for their advanced persistent threats. They're likely to use sophisticated tools and techniques. The question says they used Mimikatz to get domain admin credentials and a VPN certificate. Mimikatz is a tool used for credential dumping, so they probably have access to high-privilege accounts.

Now, the options are whether they'd use valid credentials to access via VPN or deploy backdoors. I remember that APT groups often have multiple access methods. Using valid credentials makes sense because it's a direct way to get into systems without needing to deploy additional tools. VPNs are a common method for remote access, especially if they already have legitimate access through credentials.

Backdoors like BS2005 and RoyalDNS are also possible, but if they can get in via VPN, why complicate things with backdoors? Plus, using existing access is less detectable and more efficient. So, it's more likely they'd use the VPN access they have instead of installing backdoors.

The analysis suggests that APT15 would use the valid VPN credentials they obtained to access the network directly, as this method is more efficient and less likely to be detected compared to deploying additional backdoors.

Final Answer: A: Yes
