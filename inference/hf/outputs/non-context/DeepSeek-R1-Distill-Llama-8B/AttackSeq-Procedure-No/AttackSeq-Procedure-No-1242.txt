Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT28 would divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more, targeting political figures and the aerospace industry. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT28 is a group known for their cyber espionage activities, often targeting government agencies, political entities, and large corporations. They're associated with the Russian government, so their operations are likely state-sponsored and well-organized.

The question mentions that they've used crafted modules like pr.dll to upload stolen information to a C&C server. So, the initial step is data collection using malicious DLLs. That makes sense because DLLs are a common way to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, allowing them to gather data without being easily detected.

Now, the key part is whether they would divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more. 0x1000000 is 1,048,576 bytes, which is a pretty large file size. Dividing such large files could be a way to split them into smaller chunks for easier transmission over the network, especially if the C&C server has limited bandwidth or if the data needs to be transferred in parts to avoid detection.

Targeting political figures and the aerospace industry makes sense because both are high-value targets. Political figures might have sensitive information on policies, communications, or intelligence, while the aerospace industry could have sensitive technical data, intellectual property, or military secrets.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, dividing files is a common tactic used in data exfiltration. It's a way to move data without drawing too much attention by breaking it into smaller, less suspicious chunks. This technique is part of the Data Exfiltration and Data Collection sub-technique, which is often used in APT operations.

So, considering all this, it's plausible that APT28 would divide large files into smaller parts to exfiltrate them. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The analysis indicates that APT28 would likely divide large files into smaller parts for exfiltration, aligning with their data collection and exfiltration tactics as per the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Final Answer: A: Yes
