Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Dexphot would use process hollowing after using fileless techniques for defense evasion. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Dexphot is a known malware family, and it's known for using various tactics. The question mentions that they've already used fileless techniques for defense evasion. Fileless malware, like living off the land, can execute malicious code directly from memory without needing to write to disk. This makes it harder for traditional antivirus tools to detect because they don't find a file on the disk.

Now, the question is about what comes next. After using fileless techniques, would Dexphot then use process hollowing? Process hollowing is another technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process. This can be done by manipulating the process memory space, making it look like the process is doing something legitimate, thus evading detection.

So, considering that Dexphot has already used fileless methods, using process hollowing would make sense as the next step. It's another layer of defense evasion. By using both, the malware can avoid detection from both file-based and process-based monitoring systems. This dual approach increases the chances of the attack going undetected for a longer period.

I don't see any reasons why Dexphot wouldn't use process hollowing after fileless techniques. It's a common tactic in advanced persistent threats to combine multiple evasion techniques to bypass multiple layers of security.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, Dexphot is likely to use process hollowing next.
