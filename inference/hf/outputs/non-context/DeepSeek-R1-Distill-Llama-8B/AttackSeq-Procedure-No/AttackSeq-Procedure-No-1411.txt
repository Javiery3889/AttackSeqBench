Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TeamTNT would scan IP ranges for open Docker API endpoints after using an open Weave Scope service to get initial access to a Kubernetes cluster. Then, they would set the downloaded coin miner's attributes to immutable and start mining crypto. The question is whether this sequence is likely.

First, I need to break down the attack sequence described. The initial access is through an open Weave Scope service. I know that Weave Scope is a container security tool for Kubernetes, so it's used for managing containerized applications. If it's open, that means it's exposed, which could be a vulnerability because it allows external access to the cluster's API.

Once they have initial access, the next step would probably involve identifying more attack vectors within the cluster. Since the question mentions Docker API endpoints, I'm thinking that TeamTNT would look for exposed Docker APIs. These endpoints could be used to deploy malicious containers or further expand their access.

After identifying these endpoints, the next logical step would be to deploy malware. The malware in question here is a coin miner, which is often used for cryptocurrency mining, providing attackers with a revenue source. The attributes being set to immutable suggests that the container can't be stopped or modified once deployed, making it a persistent way to run the miner without interference.

So, the sequence would be: initial access via Weave Scope, scanning for Docker endpoints, deploying the miner, and making it immutable. This makes sense because each step builds on the previous one, escalating the attack from access to persistence and monetization.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Since the reasoning aligns with the typical tactics of an attacker, I think the answer is A.

The sequence described aligns with typical cyberattack tactics, starting with initial access, identifying additional attack vectors, deploying malware, and ensuring persistence. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
