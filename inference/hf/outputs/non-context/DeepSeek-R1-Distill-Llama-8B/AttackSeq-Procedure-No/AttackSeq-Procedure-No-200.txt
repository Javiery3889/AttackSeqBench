Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the GreyEnergy group would use PDQ Deploy after compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini and tools like Nmap and Mimikatz. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that GreyEnergy is a threat group associated with Russia, and they're known for using various tools in their attacks. The question mentions they used GreyEnergy mini, which I think is a tool for initial access. They also used Nmap, which is a network scanning tool, and Mimikatz, which is used for credential dumping. So, after compromising a computer, they probably want to move laterally within the network to infect more machines.

Now, PDQ Deploy is a tool used for deploying software, often used by attackers to spread malware or tools across a network. It's a popular choice because it's effective for lateral movement and persistence. So, after using tools like Mimikatz to get credentials, the next logical step would be to use PDQ Deploy to spread malicious software or other tools.

I don't recall any information that would suggest they wouldn't use PDQ Deploy in this scenario. It fits well with their typical tactics. So, the answer should be yes, they would use PDQ Deploy.

The GreyEnergy group, after compromising a computer and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz for initial access and credential dumping, would likely use PDQ Deploy to move laterally and deploy malicious software across the network. PDQ Deploy is a common tool for such operations, aligning with their tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
