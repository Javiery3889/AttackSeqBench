Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SUNSPOT ransomware will engage in double-extortion after monitoring MsBuild.exe processes. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the MITRE ATT&CK framework is used to describe adversary tactics and techniques. The question mentions the Discovery tactic, specifically looking for MsBuild.exe. MsBuild.exe is a tool that's often used in certain attack frameworks, like the .NET development environment. It's commonly used for building software, so it's a legitimate process, but it can also be a red flag for certain types of attacks.

Now, SUNSPOT is a known ransomware group. I remember that some ransomware groups use double-extortion, which means they first exfiltrate sensitive data and then encrypt it, demanding payment for the data's return. So, the question is whether seeing MsBuild.exe in the process list would indicate that SUNSPOT is planning a double-extortion attack.

I should think about how SUNSPOT operates. From what I recall, SUNSPOT is known for targeting Windows systems, and they do use various tactics. The initial access might involve using legitimate tools to get into the network, which could include MsBuild.exe as part of their tactics. Once they have access, they might exfiltrate data and then encrypt it, hence the double-extortion aspect.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether this scenario (monitoring MsBuild.exe) is likely to lead to double-extortion. So, if MsBuild.exe is detected, it's a possible indicator of SUNSPOT's activities. Therefore, the answer would be yes, it's likely they'll engage in double-extortion.

The presence of MsBuild.exe, a known tool used in certain attack frameworks, is a potential indicator of SUNSPOT's activities. SUNSPOT is known to employ double-extortion tactics, exfiltrating data before encrypting it. Therefore, monitoring MsBuild.exe suggests a possible double-extortion attack is likely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
