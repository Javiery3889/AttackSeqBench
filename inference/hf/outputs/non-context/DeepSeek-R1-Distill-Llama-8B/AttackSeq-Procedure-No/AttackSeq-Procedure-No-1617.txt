Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Regin is a malware family, part of the TTPs used by various cyber actors. TTPs are techniques, tools, and procedures used during attacks. The question is about what Regin does during the discovery phase.

I think the discovery phase is the initial stage where an attacker gathers information about the target network. So, what kind of TTPs would be used here? I recall that network traffic monitoring and low-level packet sniffing are common methods for data collection. So, if Regin is using these, it's probably doing some network monitoring.

Now, the question mentions gathering info on processes and memory utilization. Process information would involve things like which processes are running, maybe their versions, and how they're behaving. Memory utilization could mean looking for suspicious processes using too much RAM or specific memory dumps.

Also, scanning for deleted files. That makes me think of tools that can recover deleted files, which might be part of forensic analysis. So, maybe Regin uses tools that can scan for files that have been deleted but not necessarily encrypted or hidden.

Looking at the answer choices, A says yes, and B says no. I think A is correct because Regin is known to perform these activities during the discovery phase. It uses various TTPs like network monitoring, process enumeration, and file scanning to gather intelligence. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The question asks whether Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase. Based on the analysis, Regin is known to use network traffic monitoring and low-level packet sniffing, which are TTPs used in the discovery phase. It also employs tools to gather process information and scan for deleted files, which aligns with the activities described. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
