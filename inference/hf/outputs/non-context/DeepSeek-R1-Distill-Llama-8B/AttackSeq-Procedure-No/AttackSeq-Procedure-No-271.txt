Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Mustang Panda's Korplug variant, which uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP with compressed and encrypted messages, would perform data discovery on the system, like collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives. The question is asking if this is likely, and the options are Yes or No.

First, I need to understand what Mustang Panda's Korplug variant does. From what I remember, Mustang Panda is a Chinese state-sponsored APT group. Their Korplug variant is known for using custom protocols, which suggests they have their own way of communicating and exfiltrating data. The fact that it's using TCP for data exfiltration and compressing and encrypting the messages makes me think they're trying to avoid detection by using methods that are less obvious or more sophisticated.

Now, the question is about data discovery. Data discovery typically refers to the process of gathering information about data on a system, which could include metadata like file names, file sizes, file types, user IDs, etc. So, does this variant do that?

I recall that some APT groups use tools like Mimikatz for credential dumping, which helps them gather information about user accounts and system configurations. But does this specific variant, Korplug, do that? Or does it focus more on exfiltration once it's already on the system?

Wait, the question mentions that it's using a custom protocol for exfiltration. So maybe the data discovery is part of the initial phase before exfiltration. If they're using a custom protocol, perhaps they first need to map out the available data on the system to know what to exfiltrate. That would make sense because they need to know what files or data to target.

Also, considering that the protocol is over TCP and uses compression and encryption, it's likely they're being cautious to avoid detection. So, they might first gather metadata to identify valuable data, compress and encrypt it, and then exfiltrate it.

I think that makes sense. So, the answer would be Yes, it's likely they perform data discovery.

The analysis indicates that Mustang Panda's Korplug variant, using a custom TCP protocol for exfiltration, would likely perform data discovery to identify and collect metadata and content from mapped drives before exfiltrating data. This aligns with typical APT behavior of gathering information about the system environment to target data effectively.

Final Answer: A: Yes
