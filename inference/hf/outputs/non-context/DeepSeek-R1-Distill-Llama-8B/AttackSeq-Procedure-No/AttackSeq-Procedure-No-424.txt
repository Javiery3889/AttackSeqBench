Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether, after an initial access through phishing emails with a malicious Word document, a COM object will execute queries to gather system info and download Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that phishing emails often serve as the initial vector for cyberattacks. The malicious document, in this case, is likely a Word file that, when opened, triggers some malicious code. Since it's a Word document, it's probably using macros or some embedded scripts to execute actions on the system.

I remember that malicious documents can exploit vulnerabilities or use social engineering to trick users into enabling macros. Once macros are enabled, the document might execute commands that download additional malicious software or interact with the system in unintended ways.

Now, COM objects in Windows can be used by malicious actors to interact with the Windows environment. They can execute commands, gather system information, or interact with other processes. So, if the malicious code in the Word document is using a COM object, it's plausible that this object is being used to gather system information, which would be the first step in an attack.

After gathering information, the next logical step would be to download malicious payloads. Ursnif and GandCrab are both known malware families. Ursnif is known for its ransomware capabilities, while GandCrab is also a ransomware that can spread across networks. These malware often use various methods to download and execute themselves onto a system, such as using command-line tools or scripts.

So, putting it together, the sequence would be: initial access via phishing leads to enabling macros, which then trigger a COM object to gather system info, and then that COM object is used to download Ursnif and GandCrab malware. This makes the answer likely to be "Yes."

The sequence starts with phishing emails leading to a malicious Word document. Enabling macros in the document triggers a COM object, which is then used to gather system information. This COM object is then utilized to download Ursnif and GandCrab malware. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
