Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a certain cyber attack sequence is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that a skip-2.0 backdoor is used. I remember that skip-2.0 is a tool used by the APT29 group, which is known for attacks like the 2016 election interference. This backdoor gives them access to systems, usually through a compromised network device or a compromised user's credentials.

The backdoor is using hooks in sqllang.dll. I think sqllang.dll is a legitimate Microsoft component, so using hooks here might help in evading detection because it's a common part of the system. By hooking into this, the attacker can manipulate database queries, maybe to cover their tracks or gain more access.

Next, the backdoor blocks event logging. This makes sense because if logging is disabled, it's harder for security teams to detect unusual activities. So the attacker can operate stealthily without leaving a trace.

Now, the question is whether the attacker will use a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD. Azure AD is a big part of many organizations, especially those using Microsoft services. A global admin has a lot of privileges, so if they get access, they can do a lot of damage.

The attacker wants to backdoor a service principal with Application Impersonation rights. Service principals in Azure AD are like accounts that applications use to access resources. If an attacker gets impersonation rights, they can act as any user, including the global admin, which would allow them to access email systems, like Exchange, to collect emails.

Putting it all together, the attacker's steps would likely be: compromise credentials, use a backdoor to maintain access, hook into a legitimate process to avoid detection, disable logging, and then use a high-privilege account to gain more access and exfiltrate data. So yes, it's plausible they'd use a compromised Azure AD account to get the necessary permissions to access mailboxes.

The attacker's sequence involves using a backdoor to gain initial access, hooking into a legitimate system component to avoid detection, and then leveraging a compromised Azure AD account with high privileges to access email systems. This aligns with known APT29 tactics, making the answer likely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
