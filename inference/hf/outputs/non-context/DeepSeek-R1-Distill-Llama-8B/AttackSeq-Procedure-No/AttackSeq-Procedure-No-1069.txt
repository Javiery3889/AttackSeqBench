Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Tropic Trooper would execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe after using Equation Editor exploits to run an installer with malicious payloads. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each component is. Tropic Trooper is a tool used by APT29, a cyber espionage group, known for targeting Windows systems. They often use various tactics and techniques in their attacks. The question mentions injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe, which is a legitimate process that loads DLLs. This is a common technique to achieve persistence or execute malicious code.

Next, Equation Editor exploits. I recall that Equation Editor is a legitimate tool used for editing equations in documents, but it's also been exploited as a vector for delivering malicious code. Attackers can create a malicious .eq file that, when opened, executes arbitrary code. So, using Equation Editor to execute an installer package makes sense as a method of delivering malicious payloads.

Now, the question is about the sequence: after injecting the DLL, does Tropic Trooper use FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe after using Equation Editor? I need to think about how these tools are typically used together.

FakeRun is another tool, often used by APT29, which acts as a loader for malicious DLLs. It's known to be used in attacks like the 2016 US election interference. FakeRun can create a legitimate-looking process to execute malicious code. So, if Tropic Trooper injects a DLL into dllhost.exe, maybe they would use FakeRun to launch it, making it appear as a legitimate process.

But wait, the question is about whether FakeRun is used after Equation Editor. So, the sequence would be: first, using Equation Editor to execute an installer with malicious payloads, and then using FakeRun to launch the malicious DLL via dllhost.exe.

I think that makes sense because Equation Editor is used to deliver the installer, which might drop the malicious DLL, and then FakeRun is used to inject it into a legitimate process like dllhost.exe for persistence or execution.

Alternatively, maybe the DLL is injected directly, but using FakeRun as a loader could help in evading detection by making it look like a legitimate process. So, the sequence would involve using Equation Editor to deliver the installer, which might create or drop the malicious DLL, and then using FakeRun to load it via dllhost.exe.

I'm a bit confused about whether the injection happens before or after using Equation Editor. But the question is about the order: after using Equation Editor, does Tropic Trooper use FakeRun to launch the DLL via dllhost.exe? So, the steps would be:

1. Use Equation Editor exploit to execute an installer with malicious payloads.
2. Then, use FakeRun to launch the malicious DLL via dllhost.exe.

Yes, that seems plausible. So the answer would be A: Yes.

The sequence described aligns with how Tropic Trooper typically operates. After using Equation Editor to deliver malicious payloads via an installer, FakeRun is employed to load the malicious DLL through a legitimate process like dllhost.exe, aiding in evading detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
