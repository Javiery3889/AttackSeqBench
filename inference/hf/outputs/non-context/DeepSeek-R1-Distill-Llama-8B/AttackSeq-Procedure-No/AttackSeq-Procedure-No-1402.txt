Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy after leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. The question is whether they would use these tools to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network for lateral movement before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

First, I need to recall what I know about FIN13. I think FIN13 is a threat group associated with APT29, which is known for targeting financial institutions. They're known for their advanced persistent threats (APTs), so they probably have a sophisticated approach.

The question mentions that they used native OS binaries and custom malware during discovery. Native binaries are legitimate tools that are already present on the system, so they can be used without raising too many alarms. This phase is likely for initial access and reconnaissance.

After that, they might want to move laterally within the network. Lateral movement is about moving from one system to another within the same network, which is a common goal in APTs. Tools like PDQ Deploy are used for deploying software, so they could use it to distribute malware or other tools like AvosLocker across the network.

AvosLocker is a ransomware that encrypts files, so having it spread via PDQ Deploy makes sense. Once they have access to network shared drives, they can collect sensitive data, which they might use for financial fraud. So the sequence would be: use native tools for initial access, then deploy malware via PDQ Deploy for lateral movement, then access shared drives to collect data.

Looking at the answer choices, A says yes, B says no. Since the reasoning aligns with known APT tactics, I think A is correct.

The sequence described aligns with the typical tactics of advanced persistent threat groups like FIN13, which often use native tools for initial access, then deploy malware via software tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement, followed by data collection from network shares for financial objectives.

Final Answer: A
