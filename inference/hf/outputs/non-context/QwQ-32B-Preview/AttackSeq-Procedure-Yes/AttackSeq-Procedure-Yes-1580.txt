To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the exfiltration method mentioned is plausible given the context.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Actions:**
   - Utilizing the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol.
   - Using Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control (C2) channel.

2. **Subsequent Action:**
   - Exfiltrating information by writing encrypted command results to a OneDrive subfolder using XOR key 0xAA.

I need to determine if this sequence of actions is likely for a malware or attack scenario, specifically for something referred to as "PowerStallion." Assuming PowerStallion is a hypothetical malware or attack tool, I'll evaluate based on general knowledge of malware behaviors and the technologies mentioned.

**Step 1: Understanding RPC and OneDrive as C2 Channels**

- **RPC Protocol:** RPC is a protocol that one program uses to request a service from another program located in another computer on a network. It's a common mechanism for inter-process communication and is often used by malware to communicate with C2 servers in a way that blends in with normal network traffic.

- **OneDrive as C2:** Using cloud storage services like OneDrive for C2 is a technique where attackers store and retrieve commands and data. This can be stealthy because it uses legitimate services that are expected to be present in many networks.

**Step 2: Exfiltration Method**

- **Writing to OneDrive Subfolder:** If the malware has access to OneDrive, it can use it to store exfiltrated data. This is a plausible method because it leverages legitimate cloud storage, which might not be monitored as closely as other exfiltration channels.

- **Encrypted Command Results with XOR Key 0xAA:** XOR encryption with a simple key like 0xAA is a basic obfuscation technique. While it's not strong encryption, it can suffice for avoiding simple pattern detection and making the data less readable to casual observers.

**Step 3: Evaluating Plausibility**

- **Technical Feasibility:** It's technically feasible for malware to use OneDrive for both C2 and data exfiltration. Many malware strains are designed to use cloud services for these purposes.

- **Stealth and Evasion:** Using legitimate services like OneDrive can help malware evade detection, as security measures might not scrutinize traffic to these services closely.

- **Simplicity of Encryption:** XOR with a static key is easy to implement and can be sufficient for basic obfuscation, especially if the attackers assume that such simple encryption will be overlooked or not immediately deciphered by defenders.

**Step 4: Considering Alternatives**

- **More Sophisticated Encryption:** While XOR is easy to implement, more advanced malware might use stronger encryption methods to protect exfiltrated data. However, the question specifies XOR with key 0xAA, which is plausible for less sophisticated attacks or as a preliminary obfuscation layer.

- **Alternative Exfiltration Methods:** Malware could use other methods like email, direct connections to C2 servers, or other cloud services for exfiltration. However, given that OneDrive is already being used for C2, it makes sense to use the same channel for exfiltration to maintain consistency and reduce the number of endpoints that need to be managed.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Given the context provided, it is likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate information by writing encrypted command results to a OneDrive subfolder using XOR key 0xAA. This aligns with known malware behaviors that utilize cloud services for C2 and exfiltration, and employ simple encryption methods for obfuscation.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
