To answer this question, I need to analyze whether GreyEnergy, a cyber threat actor, is likely to use specific stealth techniques after gaining initial access through spearphishing emails and compromising public-facing web servers. The techniques in question include pushing only selected modules to selected targets, partially encrypting these modules using AES-256, and running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection.

First, I need to understand who GreyEnergy is and their typical modus operandi. GreyEnergy is a sophisticated cyber threat group known for targeting industrial control systems (ICS) and critical infrastructure organizations. They are associated with espionage activities and have been linked to the theft of sensitive information and intellectual property.

Given that GreyEnergy is a sophisticated actor, it's plausible that they would employ advanced techniques to maintain stealth and evade detection. The techniques mentioned in the question are indeed advanced and are commonly used by sophisticated threat actors to avoid detection and analysis.

Let's break down each of the techniques mentioned:

1. **Pushing only selected modules to selected targets:** This suggests a targeted approach where the threat actor customizes the attack based on the target's environment and the information they aim to exfiltrate. This is a common tactic used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to minimize their footprint and avoid unnecessary noise that could trigger security alerts.

2. **Partially encrypting modules using AES-256:** Encryption is a powerful way to obfuscate malicious code and make it harder for security researchers and antivirus software to analyze the payload. AES-256 is a strong encryption standard, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to decrypt the modules without the key.

3. **Running some modules fileless in memory:** Fileless malware operates without writing any files to the disk, which makes it harder to detect using traditional file-based scanning methods. By running modules in memory, the threat actor can reduce the chances of leaving persistent artifacts that could be discovered during forensic investigations.

Given that GreyEnergy is a sophisticated threat actor, it is likely that they would employ such advanced techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection. The combination of targeted module deployment, encryption, and fileless execution aligns with the tactics used by APT groups to conduct long-term espionage and data exfiltration operations.

Therefore, based on the characteristics of GreyEnergy and the nature of the techniques described, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
