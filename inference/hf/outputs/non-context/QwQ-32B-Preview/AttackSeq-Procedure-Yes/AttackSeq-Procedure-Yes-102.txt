To answer this question, I need to analyze the behavior of the Waterbear malware and determine if it is likely to use API hooking techniques after decrypting its payload and injecting it into a Windows service.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Payload Decryption**: The malware decrypts its RC4-encrypted payload.

2. **Injection into Windows Service**: It injects this decrypted payload into an existing Windows service for execution.

3. **API Hooking Techniques**: The question asks whether, after these steps, the malware is likely to use API hooking to evade detection by modifying memory-resident functions like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable'.

Now, I need to consider whether these actions align with typical behaviors of malware, specifically Waterbear.

**Understanding Waterbear Malware**:

Waterbear is a type of malware that is known for its stealthiness and persistence. It often employs various techniques to evade detection and maintain access to compromised systems. Given that it's malware, it's reasonable to assume that it would use methods to hide its activities from security software and system monitors.

**Analyzing the Steps**:

1. **Payload Decryption**: Using RC4 encryption to protect its payload is a common tactic to avoid signature-based detection. Decrypting the payload in memory makes it harder for antivirus software to detect the malware based on static analysis.

2. **Injection into Windows Service**: Injecting code into a legitimate Windows service can help the malware masquerade as a legitimate process. This technique, known as process injection, is frequently used by malware to evade process-based detection and to gain the service's privileges.

3. **API Hooking Techniques**: API hooking involves modifying the behavior of API functions to alter their normal operation. This can be used for various purposes, including intercepting function calls to hide the malware's presence, manipulate data, or prevent security software from functioning correctly.

Given that Waterbear is malware designed for persistence and evasion, it is plausible that it would employ API hooking to modify the behavior of certain functions to hide its activities. Functions like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' are relevant because they are used by security software to enumerate processes and network connections, respectively. By hooking these functions, Waterbear could potentially hide its own processes or network activities from being detected by security tools.

**Conclusion**:

Based on the typical behaviors of malware, especially those designed for stealth and persistence, it is likely that Waterbear would use API hooking techniques after decrypting its payload and injecting it into a Windows service. This aligns with common evasion tactics used by malware to avoid detection.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
