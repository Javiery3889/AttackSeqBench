To answer this question, we need to consider the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically employed by the threat group known as Mustang Panda, particularly in the context of their spearphishing campaigns and command and control (C2) communication strategies.

First, let's understand the double extension trick mentioned in the question. The double extension trick involves naming a file with two extensions, such as "sample.doc.lnk," which can deceive users and some security systems into believing the file is a harmless Word document when, in reality, it may be a shortcut file (.lnk) that executes malicious code. This technique is used to bypass defenses and entice users to click on what appears to be a benign file.

Mustang Panda, also known as APT27 or LuckyMouse, is a Chinese state-sponsored threat group known for its cyber espionage activities. Their tactics often involve spearphishing campaigns that use social engineering to trick victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links.

Given that Mustang Panda has used the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaigns, it is reasonable to consider how they might proceed after gaining initial access to a target's system. One of the key objectives for any threat group after gaining access is to establish a persistent presence and maintain communication with their command and control servers. This is typically achieved through the use of malware that can communicate with C2 domains or IP addresses.

Therefore, it is plausible that after successfully executing the double extension trick and gaining access to a victim's system, Mustang Panda would deploy malware that attempts to connect to C2 domains or IP addresses. This would allow them to exfiltrate data, receive further instructions, or download additional malware as needed.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the typical behavior of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Mustang Panda, it is likely that they would utilize documents or other mechanisms to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses as part of their communication strategy. This aligns with standard APT practices for maintaining access and controlling compromised systems.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: A
