To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and determine whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with the specified control servers using HTTP POST requests for command and control (C2) purposes.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial Reconnaissance:**
   - Fetching network adapter information
   - Computer name
   - User name
   - IP address information
   - OS product name from the registry

2. **Potential C2 Communication:**
   - Communicating with control servers at 34.214.99.20/view_style.php and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php
   - Using HTTP POST requests for C2 purposes

Given that the Rising Sun implant has performed initial reconnaissance by gathering system information, it is plausible that it would next attempt to establish communication with its C2 servers to report this information and receive further instructions.

The MITRE ATT&CK framework can provide context here. In the framework, the "Reconnaissance" technique (TA0043) often precedes "Command and Control" (TA0011). After gathering information about the target system, malware typically needs to exfiltrate this data to the attacker and receive commands for further actions.

Looking at the specific answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the sequence of events—reconnaissance followed by communication with specific servers using HTTP POST requests—it is reasonable to conclude that the Rising Sun implant is likely to engage in C2 communication.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
