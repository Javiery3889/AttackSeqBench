To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine whether it's likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.

First, let's break down the sequence of events as described:

1. **Delivery Vector:** The malware is delivered via 'Thu moi.7z', which contains 'Thumoi.hta'.

2. **Execution of HTA File:** The 'Thumoi.hta' file contains an embedded VB Script.

3. **Dropping and Opening Decoy File:** The VB Script drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word file.

4. **Rewriting Malware:** The malware rewrites itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.

5. **Execution of Dropped .exe:** The question asks if it's likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after these actions.

Now, I need to consider whether, after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder, the malware is likely to create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file.

Malware often employs various techniques to evade detection and to ensure persistence or to carry out its malicious activities. One common technique is to drop additional payloads and execute them in a new process. This can help the malware maintain a low profile, avoid process monitoring, and make it harder for security software to trace back the malicious activities to the original malware.

Given that the malware has already dropped a decoy file and rewritten itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized name, it's plausible that it would then create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file. This would be consistent with typical malware behavior aimed at executing its payload while trying to avoid detection.

However, I should also consider that the dropped '.exe' file might be executed in the same process or through other mechanisms. But based on common malware tactics, creating a new process is a likely scenario.

Therefore, considering the sequence of events and typical malware behavior, I believe the answer is "Yes," it is likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.

**Final Answer: A**
