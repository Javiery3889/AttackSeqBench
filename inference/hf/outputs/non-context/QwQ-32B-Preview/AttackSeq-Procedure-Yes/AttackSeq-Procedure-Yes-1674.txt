To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned and determine if they form a plausible attack chain. The question presents a scenario where attackers use the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise, followed by using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery. I need to assess whether this sequence makes sense in the context of typical attack patterns.

First, let's break down the components:

1. **SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites:**

   - **SocGholish** is a malware framework that has been used in various cyberattacks, particularly those involving drive-by downloads. It is known for its ability to deliver malware through compromised websites, often without the user's knowledge.

   - **Compromised legitimate websites** are a common vector for initial compromise because they can attract a large number of users who trust the site, making it easier to distribute malware.

   - Using such a method for initial compromise is plausible and aligns with many real-world attack scenarios.

2. **Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery:**

   - **PowerView** is a collection of PowerShell functions developed by security researcher @harmj0y, which is often used by red teams and attackers for reconnaissance and lateral movement within a network.

   - The **Get-NetComputer** command is used to query Active Directory for information about computers in the domain, which can help attackers understand the network topology and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

   - Using PowerView for reconnaissance activities is common in post-exploitation phases, especially in environments where Active Directory is present.

Now, let's consider the sequence:

- **Initial Compromise:** Attackers use SocGholish delivered via compromised legitimate websites to gain an initial foothold in the target environment.

- **Post-Compromise Activity:** Once inside, they use PowerView's Get-NetComputer command to discover other systems within the network.

This sequence seems logical:

- **Step 1:** Gain access to the target environment through a widely used initial compromise vector (compromised websites).

- **Step 2:** Use established tools (PowerView) for internal reconnaissance to map the network and identify high-value targets.

However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

- **Environment Context:** The effectiveness of this sequence depends on the target environment. If the target is part of an Active Directory domain, using Get-NetComputer makes sense. If not, this technique would be irrelevant.

- **Attacker Sophistication:** The use of PowerView suggests a level of sophistication, as it requires knowledge of PowerShell and Active Directory. Not all attackers possess this level of skill.

- **Detection Risks:** Using PowerView can be detected by security measures, especially if unusual activity is monitored.

Given these points, it is plausible that attackers would follow this sequence, especially in environments where Active Directory is present, and the attackers have the necessary skills to utilize PowerView effectively.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
