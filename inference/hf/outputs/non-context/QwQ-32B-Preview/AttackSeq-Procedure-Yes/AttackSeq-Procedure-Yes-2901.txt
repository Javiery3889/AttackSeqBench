To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the conclusion drawn in the question is likely based on those actions.

First, let's break down the sequence of events as described:

1. **APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.**

   - Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential dumping, which allows attackers to extract plaintext credentials from memory. Obtaining domain administrator credentials gives APT15 high-level access to the network.

2. **Stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.**

   - By stealing a VPN certificate, APT15 can maintain persistent access to the network from remote locations, which is a common tactic for advanced persistent threats.

Given these actions, the question then posits that APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS, and used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

Now, I need to evaluate whether this sequence is likely based on the initial actions.

**Analysis:**

- **Deployment of Backdoors:**

  - After gaining high-level access and establishing persistent remote access, deploying backdoors is a standard procedure for maintaining long-term access and ensuring resilience against detection and mitigation efforts.

  - BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS are all tools associated with APT15. BS2005 is a backdoor, RoyalCLI is a command-line interface tool that can be used for various tasks including executing commands, and RoyalDNS is a DNS tool that can be used for command and control communications.

  - Given that APT15 has already established a foothold and remote access, deploying these backdoors aligns with their likely objectives of maintaining access and expanding their presence within the network.

- **Using RoyalCLI to Bypass Command Prompt Policy Settings:**

  - If the target environment has restrictions on command prompt usage as a security measure, APT15 would need to find ways to bypass these restrictions to execute necessary commands and tools.

  - RoyalCLI, being a custom tool, might have features designed to circumvent such restrictions, allowing APT15 to execute commands without triggering alarms or violating the policy settings.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the sequence of events and the nature of the tools mentioned, it is indeed likely that APT15 deployed these backdoors and used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings. This sequence aligns with typical APT behavior of gaining access, maintaining persistence, and expanding their control within the target network.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
