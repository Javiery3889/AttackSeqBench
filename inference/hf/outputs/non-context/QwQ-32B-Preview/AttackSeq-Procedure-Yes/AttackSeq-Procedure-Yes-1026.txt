I've got this question here about Gamaredon's malware tactics, and I need to decide whether it's likely that their malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection. The context is that they've already inserted malicious macros into existing documents for persistence and used a backdoor to list interesting files like Office documents during the discovery phase.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events and the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involved here. Let's break it down:

1. **Persistence through malicious macros**: This suggests that Gamaredon is using macro-based malware in Office documents to maintain a foothold on the target system. Macros are a common vector for initial infection and persistence because many users enable them without realizing the risks.

2. **Backdoor for discovery**: After gaining access, they deploy a backdoor to list interesting files, specifically Office documents. This indicates that they are looking for documents that could contain sensitive information or that could be used for further propagation.

Now, the question is whether it's likely that, as part of data collection, their malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.

Let's consider the objectives of such an attack:

- **Persistence**: Ensuring that the malware remains on the system and can be reactivated if removed.

- **Discovery**: Gathering information about the system and network to identify valuable data and potential targets for lateral movement.

- **Data Collection**: Harvesting sensitive information for exfiltration.

Given that they've already achieved persistence and are in the discovery phase, it makes sense that the next step would be to collect data. Scanning all drives, including network shares, would be a logical step in this process for several reasons:

- **Comprehensive Data Search**: Scanning all drives increases the chances of finding sensitive information, as data can be stored in various locations.

- **Network Shares**: Network shared drives often contain collaborative documents and sensitive files that are accessible to multiple users, making them a rich source of information for attackers.

- **Reconnaissance**: Scanning these drives can also provide insights into the network structure, user roles, and potential high-value targets for further exploitation.

However, there are also considerations that might suggest otherwise:

- **Noise and Detection**: Extensive scanning activities can generate noticeable network traffic and log entries, increasing the risk of detection by security systems.

- **Resource Constraints**: Scanning all drives, especially if the network is large, can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.

- **Targeted Approach**: Attackers might prefer a more targeted approach, focusing on specific directories or file types known to contain sensitive information, to minimize their footprint and avoid detection.

Given these points, it seems plausible that Gamaredon's malware would scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection. The benefits of finding more data outweigh the risks, especially if the malware is designed to operate stealthily.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
