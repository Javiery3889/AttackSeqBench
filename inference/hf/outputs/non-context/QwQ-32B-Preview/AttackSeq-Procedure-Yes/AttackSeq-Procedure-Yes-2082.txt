To answer this question, I need to understand the behavior of RIG Exploit Kit (EK) and how it typically delivers exploits to victim machines. The question is asking whether RIG EK is likely to use a specific sequence of steps involving redirecting users through advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before finally redirecting them to its landing page where the actual exploit is delivered.

First, let's break down the components mentioned in the question:

1. **Browser vulnerabilities**: These are weaknesses in web browsers that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine.

2. **Execute commands**: Once a vulnerability is exploited, attackers can execute commands on the victim's machine, often leading to further compromise.

3. **Obtaining capabilities**: This likely refers to gaining certain levels of access or permissions on the victim's system.

4. **RIG EK**: RIG Exploit Kit is a known exploit kit that targets vulnerabilities in browsers and their plugins to deliver malware.

5. **Deliver exploits**: The process of delivering malicious code that takes advantage of software vulnerabilities.

6. **Redirecting users**: The act of sending users from one webpage to another, often without their knowledge or consent.

7. **Advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising**: Malvertising is the use of online advertising to spread malware. It can involve placing malicious ads on legitimate websites or compromising existing ads to redirect users to malicious content.

Now, considering the sequence described in the question:

- Using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines and obtain capabilities.

- Before delivering the exploit, redirecting users through advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising, and then to the landing page.

I need to determine if this sequence is likely for RIG EK.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Understanding RIG EK's modus operandi**:

   - RIG EK is known for targeting vulnerabilities in browsers and their plugins, such as Java, Flash, and others.

   - It often uses malvertising campaigns to distribute its exploits.

   - Victims are typically lured to infected advertising networks or compromised websites where they are served with malicious ads.

2. **Sequence of events in a typical RIG EK attack**:

   - A user visits a website that displays ads from an ad network compromised by attackers.

   - The malicious ad contains code that checks the user's browser and its plugins for vulnerabilities.

   - If vulnerabilities are found, the user is redirected to the RIG EK landing page, where the exploit is delivered.

   - Upon successful exploitation, malware is downloaded and executed on the victim's machine.

3. **Analyzing the question's sequence**:

   - The question mentions using browser vulnerabilities to execute commands and obtain capabilities.

   - It then asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users through advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting to its landing page.

4. **Evaluating the answer choices**:

   - **A: Yes**

     - This would align with the typical behavior of RIG EK, as it is known to use malvertising to redirect users to its landing page.

   - **B: No**

     - This would suggest that RIG EK does not use this sequence, which contradicts known behaviors.

5. **Conclusion**:

   - Given that RIG EK is known to use malvertising to redirect users to its landing page, where exploits are delivered, the sequence described in the question is consistent with its modus operandi.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is **A: Yes**.

**Final Answer: A**
