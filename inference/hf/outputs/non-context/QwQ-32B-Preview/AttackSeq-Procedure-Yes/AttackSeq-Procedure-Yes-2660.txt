To answer this question, I need to analyze the behavior of the Mustang Panda's Korplug variant and determine if it is likely to use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP with compressed and encrypted messages after performing data discovery.

First, let's understand what Mustang Panda and Korplug are. Mustang Panda is a Chinese state-sponsored threat group known for its cyber espionage activities. Korplug is a malware family associated with this group, which has been used in various attacks targeting entities in South Korea and other regions.

Data discovery is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where the malware gathers information about the compromised system, including mapping drives, collecting metadata, and sometimes exfiltrating content. This information helps the attackers understand the environment and identify valuable data to steal.

Now, regarding data exfiltration, it's crucial for malware to transmit the collected data back to the attackers in a way that avoids detection and ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the data. Using a custom protocol over TCP with compression and encryption is a sophisticated method that can help achieve these goals.

Compression reduces the size of the data, making transmission faster and less noticeable, especially over limited bandwidth connections. Encryption protects the data from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties, such as network administrators or security solutions.

Given that Mustang Panda is a state-sponsored group, it's likely that they have the resources and expertise to develop custom protocols for their malware. Custom protocols can be designed to evade standard network monitoring tools, which are often configured to detect known protocols and patterns.

Moreover, using TCP for data exfiltration is common because TCP is a reliable protocol that ensures data is transmitted without errors and in the correct order. Many networks allow TCP traffic, making it a stealthy choice for exfiltration.

Considering the above points, it is plausible that the Korplug variant used by Mustang Panda would employ a custom protocol over TCP for exfiltrating compressed and encrypted data after performing data discovery.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
