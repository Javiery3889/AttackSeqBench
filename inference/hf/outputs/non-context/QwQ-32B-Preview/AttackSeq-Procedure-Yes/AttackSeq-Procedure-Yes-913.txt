So I've got this question here about FAKEM RAT and its communication methods. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that FAKEM RAT disguises its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols such as Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger. This is likely done to evade detection by blending in with normal traffic. So, it's using some form of traffic masquerading to hide its activities.

Then, it asks whether it's likely that the controller will communicate with the compromised computer using encrypted network communication that includes XOR operations for encryption during command and control (C2) activities.

Okay, so we need to think about two main aspects here:

1. Disguising traffic to look like legitimate protocols.

2. Using encrypted communication with XOR operations for C2.

The question is whether these two things are likely to be used together by FAKEM RAT.

Let's consider each part separately.

First, disguising traffic to look like legitimate protocols is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection. By mimicking legitimate protocols, the malware's traffic is more likely to blend in with normal network activity, making it harder for network security measures to identify and block it.

Now, regarding the encryption method: XOR operations are a simple form of encryption. They can be used to obfuscate data, making it look like random noise and thus harder to detect. However, XOR encryption is relatively easy to reverse if the key is known or guessed, so it's not very secure against determined analysis.

But in the context of evading detection, simple encryption like XOR can still be effective because it makes the data look less like plain text or known protocol data, which can help avoid triggering pattern-based detection mechanisms.

So, combining these two tactics—disguising traffic as legitimate protocols and using XOR encryption for C2 communication—seems plausible. Both methods are aimed at evading detection, and using them together could provide an additional layer of protection against being caught.

Moreover, it's not uncommon for malware to use multiple techniques to hide its activities. Disguising the traffic to look like legitimate protocols handles the outer layer of the communication, making it look benign, while XOR encryption adds an extra step to hide the actual content of the messages.

Therefore, it seems likely that FAKEM RAT would use both of these methods in its C2 communications.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on this reasoning, I would choose A: Yes.

It's important to note that without specific information about FAKEM RAT, this is an educated guess based on common malware behaviors. However, given that the question is phrased in a way that suggests this is a plausible scenario, and considering the tactics typically employed by malware for evasion, A: Yes seems to be the most appropriate answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
