To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions "ChChes," which I believe is a typo or mis spelling, and it's likely referring to "Cobalt Strike's" Beacon or another type of malware that uses similar tactics. However, since the exact malware isn't clear, I'll proceed with the assumption that it's a malware that uses HTTP cookies for communication with its command and control (C&C) servers.

The question states that the malware establishes communication with C&C servers using HTTP cookie headers for defense evasion. This suggests that the malware is trying to blend in with normal traffic to avoid detection by security measures.

Now, the question asks whether it's likely that the malware will communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules, expanding its capabilities through encrypted communication methods.

Let's consider this in parts:

1. **Receiving Commands and Modules:**

   - It's common for malware to communicate with C&C servers to receive new commands and additional modules. This allows the malware to be more flexible and perform a wider range of activities on the compromised system.

2. **Expanding Capabilities:**

   - By receiving new modules, the malware can enhance its functionality without having to be reinstalled or updated entirely. This is a efficient way for attackers to maintain control and adapt to new scenarios.

3. **Encrypted Communication Methods:**

   - Using encryption for communication with C&C servers is a standard practice in malware to evade detection by network security tools. Encrypted traffic is harder to inspect, making it more difficult for security solutions to identify malicious activities.

Given these points, it seems plausible that after establishing initial communication using HTTP cookies for evasion, the malware would proceed to use encrypted communication methods to receive further commands and modules.

However, the question is whether this is "likely." To assess likelihood, we need to consider the behavior of typical malware and the strategies employed by attackers.

- **Typical Malware Behavior:**

  - Most sophisticated malware uses a combination of techniques for communication, including using legitimate protocols (like HTTP) for initial communication and then switching to more secure and harder-to-detect methods, such as HTTPS or other encrypted channels.

- **Defense Evasion:**

  - Using HTTP cookies for initial communication is a form of defense evasion, as it mimics normal browser behavior. However, to maintain a low profile and avoid detection by more advanced security measures, malware often employs encryption for its communications.

- **Expanding Capabilities:**

  - Receiving and executing new modules is a common tactic used by malware to perform various tasks, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or launching attacks.

Considering these factors, it is indeed likely that the malware will communicate with the C&C servers to receive commands and modules, and that it will use encrypted communication methods to do so.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
