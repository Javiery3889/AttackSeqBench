To answer this question, I need to consider the typical behavior of the Lazarus group and their use of certain tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in their cyber operations.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Loader DLL and Decryption**: The question mentions that a loader DLL is used to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory. This is a common technique used for defense evasion, as it helps avoid detection by security software.

2. **Backdoor Execution in Memory**: By executing the backdoor in memory, the attackers can avoid leaving traces on the disk, making it harder for forensic analysis to detect the malware.

3. **Lazarus Group's Likely Actions**: The question asks whether, after performing these steps, the Lazarus group is likely to have the backdoors connect to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands and conduct further activities.

Now, considering the answer choices:

**A: Yes**

**B: No**

I need to determine which of these is more plausible based on known TTPs of the Lazarus group.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding Lazarus Group**:

   - The Lazarus group, also known as Hidden Cobra, is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.

   - They are known for a wide range of cyber operations, including espionage, cyber attacks, and even destructive campaigns like ransomware attacks.

2. **Typical Behavior of Lazarus Group**:

   - Lazarus is known to use various malware families and tools, often employing sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.

   - One of their common tactics is to use backdoors to maintain access to compromised systems and to receive commands from their operators.

3. **Role of Command and Control (C2) Servers**:

   - C2 servers are essential in malware operations as they allow attackers to communicate with the compromised systems, issue commands, and exfiltrate data.

   - Without C2 communication, the backdoor would be limited in its functionality, as it wouldn't be able to receive new instructions or upload stolen data.

4. **Defense Evasion Techniques**:

   - Using a loader DLL to decrypt and execute a backdoor in memory is a advanced technique aimed at evading detection by security software.

   - This suggests that the group is investing in methods to remain undetected, which aligns with their need for long-term access to target systems.

5. **Plausibility of C2 Communication**:

   - Given that the backdoor has been deployed using sophisticated evasion techniques, it is highly likely that the next step would be to establish communication with C2 servers.

   - This communication is crucial for the backdoor to carry out its intended functions, such as data exfiltration, system reconnaissance, or executing further attacks.

6. **Conclusion**:

   - Based on the typical behavior of the Lazarus group and the necessity of C2 communication for the backdoor's functionality, it is plausible that the backdoors would connect to C2 servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
