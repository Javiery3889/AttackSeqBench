To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is about Elise malware and its behavior after collecting system information. The information collected includes IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration, which are typical activities for malware during the discovery phase. This phase is crucial for the attacker to understand the environment they've infiltrated, including potential targets and resources available.

Next, the question mentions that after this discovery phase, the malware is likely to communicate with a hardcoded C2 (Command and Control) server at the IP address 103.236.150[.]14 using an application layer protocol.

So, we need to determine if this sequence of actions is plausible.

Let's consider the following points:

1. **Malware Behavior**: Malware typically has a lifecycle that includes initial infection, discovery of the environment, lateral movement, and communication back to the C2 server to report findings and receive further instructions.

2. **Discovery Phase**: The activities mentioned—collecting IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration—are standard procedures for malware to gather intelligence about the compromised system and the network it's connected to.

3. **Communication with C2**: After gathering this information, it makes sense that the malware would need to transmit this data back to the attackers. This is usually done through a C2 channel.

4. **Hardcoded C2 Server**: Having a hardcoded C2 server IP address is a common technique, especially in less sophisticated malware, where the malware is programmed to connect to specific IP addresses or domains controlled by the attackers.

5. **Application Layer Protocol**: Communication with C2 servers often uses application layer protocols to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection. Common protocols used include HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, or even email.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question seems plausible:

- Elise malware collects system information for discovery.

- It then communicates this information back to a hardcoded C2 server using an application layer protocol.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely to communicate with the hardcoded C2 server using an application layer protocol for Command and Control.

However, let's consider if there are any reasons to doubt this.

Potential counterpoints:

- **Sophistication of Malware**: More advanced malware might use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) or other techniques to dynamically generate C2 server addresses rather than using hardcoded IP addresses. But Elise is referred to as malware, and without specifying its level of sophistication, it's reasonable to assume it could use hardcoded C2 servers.

- **Evasion Techniques**: Advanced malware may use encryption or tunneling to hide C2 communications. However, using an application layer protocol is still plausible, as many such protocols support encryption (e.g., HTTPS).

- **IP Address Availability**: The IP address 103.236.150[.]14 should be active and controlled by the attackers for this to work. However, the question assumes that this is the hardcoded C2 server, so we'll take that as given.

Considering all this, there's no strong reason to doubt the plausibility of the sequence described.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
