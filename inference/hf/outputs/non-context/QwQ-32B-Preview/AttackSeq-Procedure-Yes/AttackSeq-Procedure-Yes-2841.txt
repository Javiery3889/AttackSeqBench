To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the MSIL/Crimson malware would execute on the victim's machine and attempt to download the full RAT component from the specified server before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

First, let's break down the attack sequence as described:

1. **Initial Access:** The attack begins with weaponized RTF documents that exploit CVE-2012-0158. This CVE is related to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows remote code execution.

2. **Exploit Delivery:** The exploit in the RTF document drops an embedded downloader file. This downloader is likely a small piece of malware designed to retrieve additional malware from a remote server.

3. **Malware Execution:** The downloader file is associated with MSIL/Crimson malware. MSIL stands for Microsoft Intermediate Language, which is used by the .NET framework. This suggests that the malware is written in a .NET language and compiled to IL code.

4. **Download of Full RAT Component:** The malware is expected to download the full Remote Access Tool (RAT) component from the server at 213.136.87[.]122 on port 10001.

5. **Command and Control Establishment:** After downloading the full RAT component, the malware establishes command and control communication using a custom TCP protocol.

Now, I need to evaluate whether this sequence is plausible and likely.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Initial Access via CVE-2012-0158:**
   - CVE-2012-0158 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows for remote code execution through specially crafted RTF files. It is plausible that attackers use such exploits to gain initial access to a victim's system.

2. **Embedded Downloader File:**
   - It is common for exploits to drop a downloader payload that is responsible for fetching additional malware from a remote server. This staged approach helps avoid detection and allows attackers to update their malware easily.

3. **MSIL/Crimson Malware:**
   - MSIL/Crimson refers to malware written in .NET, which is executed in the Common Language Runtime (CLR). This is a feasible approach as .NET provides a rich set of libraries and ease of development for malware authors.

4. **Downloading Full RAT Component:**
   - Once the downloader is executed, it typically reaches out to a command and control server to download the main payload, which in this case is a RAT. This is a standard procedure in malware operations.

5. **Establishing C2 Using Custom TCP Protocol:**
   - After downloading the RAT, the malware would establish communication with the C2 server using a custom protocol over TCP. This allows for stealthier communication and evasion of network defenses.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**

- **Option A: Yes**
  - This option affirms that the described sequence is likely to occur.

- **Option B: No**
  - This option denies the likelihood of the described sequence.

Given the plausibility of each step in the attack sequence and the common practices in malware operations, it is reasonable to conclude that the sequence described is likely to occur.

**Final Answer: A**
