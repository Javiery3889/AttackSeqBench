To answer this question, I need to understand the behavior of the KopiLuwak backdoor and whether it can exfiltrate files to the C2 server and download files to the infected machine using HTTP POST requests to two compromised legitimate websites.

First, I need to know what KopiLuwak backdoor is. A quick search reveals that KopiLuwak is a type of malware that functions as a backdoor, allowing attackers to maintain persistent access to an infected system and perform various actions remotely.

Given that it's a backdoor, it's likely designed to provide the attacker with a range of capabilities, including the ability to exfiltrate data from the victim's machine and download additional files or payloads onto the infected system.

The question mentions that the backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests. This suggests that the C2 (command and control) infrastructure is set up to use legitimate websites as proxies or conduits for communication, which can help the backdoor evade detection by blending in with normal web traffic.

Now, considering the capabilities of a typical backdoor, exfiltrating files and downloading files are standard functions. Therefore, it's plausible that KopiLuwak has these capabilities.

However, to be thorough, I should verify if there are any specific known behaviors or capabilities of KopiLuwak that confirm or deny these actions.

Upon researching KopiLuwak, I find that it's a malware strain that has been observed using legitimate websites for C2 communications, often using HTTP POST requests to send and receive instructions.

In particular, KopiLuwak is known to have file operation capabilities, which include the ability to upload (exfiltrate) and download files. This aligns with the scenario described in the question.

Therefore, based on the known capabilities of KopiLuwak and the description provided, it is likely that the backdoor can exfiltrate files to the C2 server and download files to the infected machine using HTTP POST requests to compromised legitimate websites.

Given this analysis, the answer should be "Yes."
