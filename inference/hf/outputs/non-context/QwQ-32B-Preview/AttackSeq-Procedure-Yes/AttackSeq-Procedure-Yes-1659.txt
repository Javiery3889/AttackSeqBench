To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned and determine if the described behavior aligns with typical malware operations.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading:** This is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in the same directory as a legitimate executable, taking advantage of how Windows searches for DLLs.
   - **HTML Smuggling:** This likely refers to delivering malicious payloads through HTML files, possibly to bypass certain security controls.

2. **Subsequent Actions:**
   - **Gather System Information:** Collecting details like the username and computer name.
   - **Encrypted HTTPS Communication:** Establishing a connection with a command and control (C2) server using HTTPS for evasion and confidentiality.

The question is whether these actions are likely after employing the mentioned defense evasion techniques.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
   - Both DLL side-loading and HTML smuggling are methods used to deliver and execute malicious code on a target system while avoiding detection by security software.
   - These techniques suggest that the malware is designed to be stealthy and evade initial detection.

2. **Gathering System Information:**
   - Once a malware has successfully evaded defenses and executed on a target system, it often needs to gather information about the environment it's in.
   - Collecting system information like the username and computer name can help the malware:
     - Identify the system's configuration and potential value.
     - Customize its behavior based on the system it's running on.
     - Report back to its C2 server with identifying information.

3. **Encrypted HTTPS Communication:**
   - Using HTTPS for C2 communication is a common tactic to evade network-level detection and to maintain confidentiality of the commands being exchanged.
   - Encrypting the communication makes it harder for security tools to inspect the traffic and detect malicious activities.

**Plausibility of the Sequence:**

- It is highly plausible that after successfully evading defenses using techniques like DLL side-loading and HTML smuggling, malware would proceed to gather system information.
- This information gathering is a standard step in the malware's lifecycle, typically occurring after initial execution and before establishing communication with the C2 server.
- Using encrypted HTTPS for C2 communication is also a standard practice in modern malware to avoid detection and analysis.

**Conclusion:**

Given the sequence of events described, it is likely that the malware will gather system information before attempting to communicate with its C2 server. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
