To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events and evaluate the likelihood of each step occurring in the order described.

First, the backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials. This is a common tactic used by malware to gain access to a user's online accounts and potentially harvest sensitive information.

Next, the question mentions that the backdoor is likely to ping the C2 (command and control) server at regular intervals. Pinging a C2 server is a standard procedure for malware to check in with its operators, receive new commands, or upload stolen data.

Then, the backdoor is supposed to collect and upload targeted file types such as .doc, .docx, and .pdf to the same server.

Now, let's consider the sequence:

1. Steal Chrome credentials.

2. Ping C2 server at regular intervals.

3. Collect and upload specific file types to the C2 server.

Is this sequence plausible?

Stealing credentials is often one of the initial steps in an attack. Once the malware has accessed the credentials, it might immediately try to exfiltrate them to the C2 server. However, pinging the C2 server at regular intervals is also a common practice to maintain communication and receive further instructions.

In many malware operations, the malware will periodically check in with the C2 server to report its status, upload stolen data, or download new modules or commands. So, pinging the C2 server at regular intervals makes sense as a持续性活动，以保持与操作者的通信。

After stealing the credentials and possibly reporting back to the C2 server, the malware might proceed to look for and exfiltrate specific file types, such as documents and PDFs, which could contain additional sensitive information.

So, in this sequence:

- Steal credentials.

- Ping C2 server (possibly to report the stolen credentials).

- Collect and upload specific file types.

This seems like a logical sequence of events.

However, the question specifies that the backdoor will ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading the targeted file types.

Is it likely that the malware will ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting the files? Or would it collect the files and then upload them during one of the ping intervals?

Malware often has a routine where it performs certain actions at specific times or in response to certain triggers. It's possible that the malware is set to ping the C2 server every X minutes or hours, and during these check-ins, it may upload any newly collected data.

Alternatively, the malware could be set to collect data continuously and upload it during the regular ping intervals.

Given this, it's plausible that the malware pings the C2 server at regular intervals and, during these pings, uploads any collected data, including the stolen credentials and the targeted file types.

Therefore, the sequence makes sense:

- Steal credentials.

- Ping C2 server at regular intervals, uploading stolen credentials and any collected files during these pings.

But the question seems to imply that the pinging happens before the collection of file types, which might be a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the malware pings the C2 server, receives a command to collect specific file types, and then proceeds to do so.

In that case, the sequence would be:

- Steal credentials.

- Ping C2 server and receive command to collect specific file types.

- Collect and upload specific file types.

This also makes sense.

Given the options, it seems that the sequence is plausible, and therefore, answer choice A: Yes, is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
