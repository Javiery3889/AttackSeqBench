To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the actions mentioned are likely to occur after privilege escalation using a specific Metasploit module.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Privilege Escalation using Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll:**

   - Metasploit is a popular penetration testing framework that contains various modules for exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - The module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` is likely a specific exploit or payload designed for privilege escalation on a target system.
   - Privilege escalation is the process by which an attacker with initial access to a system gains higher-level permissions, such as administrative or root access.

2. **Shellcode contacting C&C server:**

   - After privilege escalation, the next step often involves establishing communication with a command and control (C&C) server.
   - The C&C server is where the attacker coordinates further malicious activities, such as downloading additional payloads, receiving instructions, or exfiltrating data.

3. **Specifics of the C&C communication:**

   - The question mentions that the shellcode will contact the C&C server at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ`.
   - It also states that the domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` will be resolved to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91`.

Now, let's evaluate the plausibility of these events occurring in sequence.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Privilege Escalation:**

   - Assuming the Metasploit module successfully escalates privileges, the next logical step for an attacker is to maintain access and potentially conduct further activities.
   - This often involves establishing a backdoor or maintaining a persistent presence on the compromised system.

2. **Communication with C&C Server:**

   - After gaining higher privileges, it is common for malware or attack tools to reach out to a C&C server to report success or to receive further instructions.
   - The use of HTTPS (`https://`) for C&C communication is also typical, as it can help evade network detection mechanisms that might be in place.

3. **Domain Resolution:**

   - The resolution of the domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91` suggests that the domain is being used as a掩护 or a decoy to make the C&C server appear benign.
   - Attackers often use domain generation algorithms or legitimate-looking domains to obfuscate their C&C servers.

4. **Likelihood of Sequence:**

   - Given that privilege escalation is successful, it is plausible that the next step would be to contact a C&C server for further instructions or to download additional payloads.
   - The specific URL path `/6OHEJ` and the use of a seemingly unrelated domain (`psychology-blog.ezua[.]com`) are consistent with tactics used by malware authors to blend in with normal traffic.

5. **Consideration of Answer Choices:**

   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that the sequence of events is likely.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that the sequence of events is not likely.

Given the analysis above, the sequence of events described appears to be a plausible sequence of actions an attacker might take after successfully escalating privileges using a Metasploit module.

**Final Answer: A**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
