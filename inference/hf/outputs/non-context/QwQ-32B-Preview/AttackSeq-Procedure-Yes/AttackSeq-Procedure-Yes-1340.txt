To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events and understand the typical behavior of such malware.

1. **Initial Exploit:** The attack starts with a Flash zero-day exploit. This type of exploit takes advantage of unknown vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

2. **Arbitrary Read/Write Memory Capabilities:** Once the exploit is successful, it grants the attacker arbitrary read/write access to the memory of the Flash process. This is a powerful capability because it allows the attacker to manipulate the process's memory to execute their own code.

3. **Second Stage Shellcode:** The initial exploit likely drops a second stage shellcode. Shellcode is a small piece of code designed to perform specific tasks, often as part of a multi-stage exploit. In this case, its purpose is to download and execute the final payload.

4. **Final Payload (FinSpy):** FinSpy is a type of malware, specifically a remote administration tool (RAT), which allows the attacker to control the infected system remotely. It can capture keystrokes, record audio, take screenshots, and more.

5. **Communication with C2 Servers:** After the payload is installed, it needs to communicate with command and control (C2) servers to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.

Given this sequence, let's evaluate the answer choices:

**Option A: Yes**

- This option suggests that it is likely for the second stage shellcode to download the final payload and establish communication with C2 servers.

- In many multi-stage malware attacks, this is exactly what happens. The initial exploit is used to gain a foothold on the system, and then additional components are downloaded to perform more sophisticated tasks.

- FinSpy, being a RAT, typically requires communication with C2 servers to function effectively. Therefore, it makes sense that the second stage shellcode would facilitate this communication.

**Option B: No**

- This option suggests that it is not likely for the second stage shellcode to perform these actions.

- However, given the nature of such attacks and the functionality required by FinSpy, this seems less plausible.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the typical behavior of malware in multi-stage attacks and the requirements of a RAT like FinSpy, it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload and establish communication with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A**
