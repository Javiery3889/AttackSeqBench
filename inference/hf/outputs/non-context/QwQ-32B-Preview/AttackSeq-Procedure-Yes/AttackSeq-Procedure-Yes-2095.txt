To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if they form a plausible attack chain. Let's break down the question and evaluate each part step by step.

First, the attack begins with spear-phishing emails containing malicious DOCX documents that use the remote template technique. This is a known method where an attacker crafts a Word document that references an external, malicious template. When the document is opened, it loads the remote template, which can contain malicious code.

Next, the question mentions exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool. Equation Editor is a feature in Microsoft Word that allows users to insert mathematical equations. There have been vulnerabilities in past versions of Equation Editor that attackers could exploit to execute arbitrary code.

RoyalRoad is a tool associated with the use of Equation Editor exploits. It's designed to create malicious Equation Editor objects that can be embedded in Office documents to execute code when the document is opened.

After exploiting the Equation Editor vulnerability, the attack is said to initiate a multi-stage infection chain. This means that the initial exploit downloads additional malware or stages, which can lead to more sophisticated attacks.

Finally, the attackers create a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence. This is a common technique to ensure that the malware runs regularly and can survive system reboots.

Now, let's evaluate if this sequence makes sense:

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing with Malicious DOCX:**
   - Plausible. Attackers often use spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.

2. **Exploiting Equation Editor Vulnerabilities with RoyalRoad:**
   - Also plausible, especially if the target system has an older version of Office with known vulnerabilities in Equation Editor.

3. **Multi-Stage Infection Chain:**
   - This is a standard approach in many malware campaigns. After gaining initial access, attackers often download additional payloads to perform more actions.

4. **Creating a Scheduled Task for Persistence:**
   - This is a common technique to maintain long-term access to the compromised system.

Given that each step builds logically on the previous one and aligns with known attacker behaviors, it seems likely that this sequence of TTPs could be part of a coordinated attack.

However, I should consider if there are any red flags or inconsistencies in this sequence.

- The use of the remote template technique in DOCX files to load malicious content is well-documented.

- Exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities is also a known technique, especially against systems that haven't been updated with the latest security patches.

- Multi-stage infection chains are typical in targeted attacks to avoid detection and to perform more complex tasks.

- Creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' is a clever way to hide malicious activity behind a legitimate-sounding name.

Therefore, all these TTPs fit together in a coherent attack scenario.

Additionally, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, these actions map to several tactics and techniques:

- **Initial Access:** T1566 (Phishing), T1137 (Spearphishing Attachment)

- **Execution:** T1204 (User Execution), potentially T1222 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution) if exploiting signed binaries

- **Persistence:** T1050 (Scheduled Task/Job)

- **Defense Evasion:** T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information), possibly used in the multi-stage infection chain

Given this alignment with known attack patterns and tactics, it's reasonable to conclude that the sequence described is plausible.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
