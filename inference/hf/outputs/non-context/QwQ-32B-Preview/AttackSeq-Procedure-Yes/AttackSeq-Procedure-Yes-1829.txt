So I've got this question here about some malicious app called callCam. It sounds like it's doing some not-so-nice things on people's devices. Let me try to break this down.

First, the question mentions that the app evades detection through overlay screens during installation. Overlay screens are those pop-ups or layers that can cover other apps or parts of the screen. I've heard that some malware uses these to hide their activities or to trick users into giving permissions they wouldn't normally grant. So, it makes sense that this is a method to evade detection.

Next, it says that after evading detection, the app is likely to collect files and screenshots from the compromised devices. Well, if it's a malicious app, that seems plausible. Malware often aims to gather as much information as possible from the infected device. Files and screenshots can contain a lot of personal or sensitive data that attackers might find useful for various purposes, like identity theft, extortion, or selling the data on the dark web.

Then, the question mentions that this data would be encrypted using RSA and AES encryption algorithms before being exfiltrated to a command and control (C&C) server. Encryption is a common practice for malware to ensure that the data being sent back to the attackers is unreadable to anyone else who might intercept it, like network administrators or security researchers. Using both RSA and AES suggests that they're employing a hybrid encryption approach, which is quite standard. AES is symmetric encryption, good for encrypting large amounts of data quickly, while RSA is asymmetric, useful for securely exchanging the symmetric keys.

So, putting it all together: the app evades detection during installation using overlay screens, then collects files and screenshots, encrypts this data with RSA and AES, and sends it to a C&C server.

Now, the question is asking if this sequence of actions is likely. Given that it's a malicious app, all these steps make sense from an attacker's perspective. Evading detection is crucial to remain on the device for as long as possible to collect more data. Collecting files and screenshots is a typical behavior for information-stealing malware. Encrypting the data ensures that even if someone intercepts the communication, they can't read the data. And sending it to a C&C server allows the attackers to collect and analyze the data at their leisure.

So, is this sequence likely? Yes, it sounds very plausible. In fact, many real-world malware strains operate in similar ways.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on my analysis, I think the correct answer is A: Yes.

But let me double-check. Is there any reason to think that this sequence might not be likely? Well, one might argue that collecting files and screenshots could be risky because it increases the app's activity level, which might raise red flags to security software. However, if the app is designed carefully to perform these actions discreetly, say, during times when the device is less likely to be monitored or when the user is less active, then this risk is minimized.

Additionally, using encryption like RSA and AES is standard practice in malware design to protect the exfiltrated data. So, there doesn't seem to be any reason to doubt the plausibility of this sequence.

Therefore, my final answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
