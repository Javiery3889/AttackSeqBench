To answer this question, I need to analyze whether it's plausible that an attack could start with a PDF attachment that bypasses security filters and seems harmless, and then proceeds to use legitimate tools and scripts to carry out its operations without being detected.

First, let's consider the initial vector: a PDF attachment that passes through security filters and appears benign. PDFs are a common vector for malware because they can contain executable code or exploit vulnerabilities within the PDF reader. However, modern security filters are designed to detect malicious PDFs. If the PDF is well-crafted to avoid detection, it's possible for it to pass through these filters.

Next, the attack evades detection by using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations. This tactic is known as living off the land, where attackers use tools that are already present on the target system to perform their activities. This reduces the attacker's footprint and makes it harder for security systems to distinguish between normal user activities and malicious actions.

Given this information, it seems plausible that an attack could follow this sequence:

1. **Initial Compromise:** Send a PDF attachment that appears benign but contains exploit code.

2. **Execution:** The PDF exploit is executed, potentially giving the attacker access to the system.

3. **Persistence and Evasion:** The attacker uses legitimate tools and scripts already present on the system to maintain access and perform actions without being detected.

This approach aligns with common attack strategies and the tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under the techniques related to initial access, execution, and persistence.

Therefore, based on this analysis, it is likely that such an attack sequence could occur.

**Final Answer: A**
