To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and determine if the sequence makes sense in the context of a typical cyber attack, specifically aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the sequence of events mentioned in the question:

1. **Persistence Mechanism**: The Aria-body loader establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.

2. **Discovery Phase**: The Aria-body backdoor gathers system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: The backdoor sends collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password.

Now, let's map these actions to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to see if they form a logical sequence.

### Step 1: Persistence

- **MITRE ATT&CK Technique**: Persistence (T1547)

- **Sub-techniques**:

  - Create or modify system-level startup execution mechanisms, such as modifying registry run keys, creating startup folder shortcuts, etc.

- **Relevance**: The use of the 'Startup' folder and 'Run' registry key for persistence is a common tactic in malware to ensure they are executed upon system startup.

### Step 2: Discovery

- **MITRE ATT&CK Technique**: Discovery (T1082)

- **Sub-techniques**:

  - Query system information, such as host-name, computer-name, IP addresses, etc.

- **Relevance**: After gaining a foothold, adversaries often gather information about the compromised system to understand the environment and plan further actions.

### Step 3: Command and Control

- **MITRE ATT&CK Technique**: Command and Control (T1132)

- **Sub-techniques**:

  - Data Encoding: Using techniques like XOR encryption to obfuscate communications with the C&C server.

- **Relevance**: Exfiltrating data to the C&C server is a crucial step for adversaries to maintain control and extract valuable information.

### Sequence Analysis

1. **Persistence to Discovery**:

   - It is logical for malware to first ensure it persists across reboots and then proceed to gather information about the compromised system.

   - The persistence mechanism allows the backdoor to be active for an extended period, during which it can perform various actions, including discovery.

2. **Discovery to C2**:

   - Gathering system information is often one of the early steps in the lateral movement and reconnaissance phases.

   - Sending this information back to the C&C server allows attackers to make informed decisions about further steps in the attack.

3. **Data Exfiltration Method**:

   - Using XOR encryption for communicating with the C&C server is a simple yet effective way to obfuscate traffic and avoid detection by network monitoring tools.

### Conclusion

Given the sequence of actions—establishing persistence, followed by system discovery, and then exfiltrating data via encrypted C&C communications—it aligns well with standard adversary behaviors as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Therefore, it is plausible that the Aria-body backdoor would follow this sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

**Final Answer: A**
