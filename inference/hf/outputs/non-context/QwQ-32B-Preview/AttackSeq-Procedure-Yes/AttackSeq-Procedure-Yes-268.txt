To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the sequence makes sense based on my knowledge of cybersecurity and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the attack sequence mentioned in the question:

1. **Initial Access:** The attacker uses Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199.

2. **Execution:** The embedded .hta file is executed using mshta.exe.

3. **Persistence:** A task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' is scheduled to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.

I need to evaluate if this sequence is plausible.

**Step 1: Understanding CVE-2017-0199**

CVE-2017-0199 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user by convincing them to open a specially crafted Office document. This vulnerability can be exploited through various Office file types, including Word documents.

**Step 2: Exploiting the Vulnerability**

When a user opens the malicious Word document, the exploit code within the document can take advantage of CVE-2017-0199 to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This is the initial access vector.

**Step 3: Executing the Embedded .hta File Using mshta.exe**

Once the exploit code is executed, it may attempt to run additional payloads, such as an embedded .hta (HTML Application) file. Mshta.exe is a legitimate Windows utility used to run HTML applications. Attackers often use mshta.exe to execute malicious scripts because it is a signed Microsoft binary, which can help evade antivirus detection.

So, after exploiting the vulnerability, it makes sense that the attacker would use mshta.exe to execute the embedded .hta file.

**Step 4: Achieving Persistence by Scheduling a Task**

To maintain persistent access, attackers often create scheduled tasks that run at regular intervals. This ensures that even if the system is restarted or the user logs off and back on, the malicious code continues to execute.

In this case, the attacker schedules a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS (Visual Basic Script) file every 3 minutes. The task name is likely chosen to mimic legitimate Google update tasks, making it less conspicuous to the user or system administrators.

**Evaluating the Sequence**

- **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2017-0199 via a malicious Word document is a common technique.

- **Execution:** Using mshta.exe to execute an embedded .hta file is a plausible next step.

- **Persistence:** Scheduling a task with a name similar to legitimate system tasks to run a VBS file at regular intervals is a typical persistence mechanism.

Each step logically follows from the previous one, and the techniques used are consistent with known attacker behaviors.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed plausible. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
