To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is about the likelihood of discovering various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, after using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during the reconnaissance phase of an attack.

So, let's understand what these tools are and what they do:

1. **Masscan**: This is a fast port scanner that can scan the entire internet in under 5 minutes. It's designed to quickly identify open ports and services on a large number of IP addresses.

2. **Shodan**: This is a search engine for internet-connected devices. It allows users to find devices based on various criteria, including the services they're running, the versions of software, and more.

3. **Censys**: Similar to Shodan, Censys is an internet search engine that indexes data about all IP addresses and TLS/SSL certificates on the internet. It's useful for discovering devices and their configurations.

Now, the context is medical infrastructure. Medical networks often include a variety of devices, some of which may be outdated or have legacy systems. These could include hospital management systems, medical devices like MRI machines, X-ray machines, pacemakers, etc., which might not be regularly updated due to various reasons such as compatibility issues or the high cost of updating specialized equipment.

Given this background, let's consider the question: "Is it likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery?"

Let's think about what network service discovery entails. It's the process of identifying what services are running on a network, which ports are open, what software versions are being used, and so on. Tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys are specifically designed to help with this discovery.

Given that medical networks may have a mix of up-to-date and outdated systems, including specialized medical devices that might not be frequently updated, it's reasonable to assume that using these tools would likely uncover a range of services, some of which could be outdated or vulnerable.

Moreover, medical institutions might have perimeters that are not as tightly controlled as those in other industries, especially if they prioritize patient care and accessibility over strict security measures. This could make it easier for these tools to discover various services.

Therefore, considering all these factors, it seems likely that using such tools during reconnaissance would indeed discover various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
