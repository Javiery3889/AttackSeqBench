To answer this question, I need to analyze the behavior of the Korplug malware variant and determine whether it is likely to communicate with command and control (C&C) servers using the described methods after collecting data from various sources.

First, let's understand what Korplug is. Korplug is a malware strain that has been observed in targeted attacks, particularly against organizations in South Korea. It is known for its ability to collect sensitive information and exfiltrate it to remote servers controlled by attackers.

The question states that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This suggests that it is a versatile piece of malware designed to gather as much information as possible from its environment.

Now, regarding communication with C&C servers, the question proposes that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol, with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, followed by encrypted communication over TCP.

To evaluate this, I need to consider the following points:

1. **Use of Custom Protocols:** Malware often employs custom protocols to communicate with C&C servers to evade detection by security solutions that may look for known patterns or signatures.

2. **Initial Handshake:** Using HTTPS for the initial handshake could help in blending in with normal web traffic, making it harder for network monitoring tools to distinguish malicious traffic from legitimate HTTPS traffic.

3. **Encrypted Communication:** Encrypting subsequent communication helps protect the exfiltrated data and commands from being intercepted or tampered with, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

Given these points, it is plausible that Korplug would use such a communication method. Many advanced malware strains employ similar tactics to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

However, to make a more informed decision, I should consider whether there is any specific information about Korplug's communication methods. Unfortunately, the question doesn't provide detailed insights into Korplug's behavior beyond its data collection activities.

But based on general malware behavior and the need for stealth and security in C&C communications, it is reasonable to assume that Korplug would use a custom TCP-based protocol with encrypted communication.

Therefore, considering the above reasoning, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely for Korplug to communicate with C&C servers using the described methods.

**Final Answer: A**
