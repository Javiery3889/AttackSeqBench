To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if it forms a plausible attack scenario, specifically within the context of the BlueDelta campaign targeting Ukrainian government Roundcube mail servers.

First, let's break down the question into its components:

1. **Initial Access:** The campaign exploited CVE-2020-35730 in Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers.

2. **Post-Exploitation:** Exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to conduct discovery activities aimed at gathering information like system and network configurations.

I need to verify if this sequence makes sense from a cybersecurity perspective and aligns with known tactics used by threat actors, particularly those associated with the BlueDelta campaign.

### Step 1: Understanding CVE-2020-35730

CVE-2020-35730 is a vulnerability in Roundcube, a popular open-source webmail platform. This specific CVE pertains to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Roundcube versions before 1.4.7 and 1.5.2. XSS vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

However, for initial access, especially in a targeted campaign like BlueDelta, an XSS vulnerability might not be the most direct path for gaining initial access to the server itself. XSS is more commonly associated with client-side attacks, where the attacker targets end-users rather than the server.

### Step 2: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Roundcube Webmail Software

After gaining initial access, the question suggests that the attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Roundcube webmail software to conduct discovery activities. This seems a bit redundant because if they've already exploited a vulnerability to gain access, they might not need to exploit another vulnerability in the same software for further actions.

Moreover, once initial access is achieved, attackers typically look for ways to maintain access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network, rather than exploiting the same software again for discovery.

### Step 3: Conducting Discovery Activities

Discovery activities, such as gathering system and network configurations, are indeed standard post-exploitation tactics. Attackers need to understand the environment to plan further steps, such as lateral movement and data exfiltration.

However, the manner in which this is described seems off. If the attackers have already exploited a vulnerability to gain access, they should have some level of control over the server, allowing them to perform discovery activities directly, without necessarily needing to exploit another vulnerability in the same software.

### Step 4: Context of the BlueDelta Campaign

BlueDelta is a campaign associated with the UNC1151 (also known as Gamaredon Group) threat actor, which has been active since at least 2014 and is believed to be linked to Russian intelligence services. This group has targeted entities in Ukraine and other countries, focusing on government bodies, think tanks, and media organizations.

Given this context, it's plausible that they would target Roundcube mail servers used by the Ukrainian government. However, the specific sequence of exploiting CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and then exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube for discovery seems inefficient and not in line with typical attack patterns.

### Step 5: Evaluating the Answer Choices

**Option A: Yes**

Choosing "Yes" would imply that the described sequence of TTPs is likely and makes sense in the context of the BlueDelta campaign.

**Option B: No**

Choosing "No" would suggest that the sequence is unlikely or doesn't align with typical attack patterns or the known tactics of the BlueDelta campaign.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, the sequence of TTPs described seems implausible. Using an XSS vulnerability for initial access is unusual for a server-side attack, and exploiting another vulnerability in the same software for discovery activities appears redundant.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
