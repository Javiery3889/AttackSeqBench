To answer this question, I need to analyze the scenario and evaluate the likelihood of the described actions based on typical malware behavior and the information provided.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Malware Action**: NanHaiShu gathers system information from the infected machine and uploads it to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Proposed Behavior**:
   - Communicate with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers.
   - Upload encoded system information.
   - Switch from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address.

I need to determine if these actions are likely given the initial action of gathering and uploading system information.

**Step 1: Understanding C&C Communication**

Malware often uses C&C servers to receive further instructions or upload stolen data. The way it communicates with these servers can vary widely, depending on the malware's design and the attacker's objectives.

**Step 2: Dynamic DNS Providers**

Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that automatically updates the DNS entries to point to the current IP address of a server. Malware might use DDNS to make its C&C servers more resilient to takedown attempts, as the domain name can point to different IP addresses over time.

**Step 3: Encoding System Information**

Encoding data before uploading is a common practice for malware to obfuscate the data being transmitted, making it harder for network security measures to detect the exfiltration of sensitive information.

**Step 4: Switching IP Addresses**

Changing the IP address from which communications originate can be a tactic to evade detection or to route traffic through different geographic locations for various reasons, such as bypassing geographic restrictions or misleading attribution.

**Step 5: Geographic Shift from US to Chinese IP**

The shift from US-based IP addresses to a Chinese IP address is noteworthy. This could be an attempt to confuse attribution or to utilize infrastructure in a particular region.

**Step 6: Evaluating Plausibility**

Given that NanHaiShu is already gathering and uploading system information, it is plausible that it would use dynamic DNS to maintain C&C communications and encode the data for stealth. The switch from US to Chinese IP addresses could be part of the malware's operational strategy, possibly to route traffic through different proxies or to use infrastructure in a specific location.

However, without specific information linking NanHaiShu to such behaviors, we must rely on general malware tactics.

**Step 7: Considering Alternatives**

Option A suggests that yes, it is likely that the malware will engage in these activities. Option B says no, it is not likely.

Given that many advanced malware strains employ techniques like DDNS for C&C communications and data encoding for evasion, Option A seems more plausible.

**Step 8: Conclusion**

Based on typical malware behavior and the actions described, it is likely that NanHaiShu would use dynamic DNS providers for C&C communications, upload encoded system information, and switch IP addresses, possibly from US to Chinese IPs, as part of its operational tactics.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
