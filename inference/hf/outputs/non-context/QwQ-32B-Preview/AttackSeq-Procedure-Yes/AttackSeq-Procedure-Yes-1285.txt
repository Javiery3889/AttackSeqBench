To answer this question, I need to understand the relationship between the actions described in the question and the likelihood of TClient using SSL for communication with the C&C server.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Attack Phase: Defense Evasion**

   - **Action:** Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to load a malicious `wab32res.dll` through a benign file.

   - **Purpose:** To remove its traces.

   - **Technique:** DLL hijacking is a method where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a directory where an application is likely to look for a legitimate DLL. When the application loads the DLL, it executes the malicious code.

2. **Attack Phase: Command and Control (C2)**

   - **Action:** TClient is set to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server.

   - **Question:** Is it likely that this connection will use SSL?

Now, I need to evaluate whether the use of SSL for C2 communication is likely, given the information about the Defense Evasion phase.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding DLL Hijacking and Defense Evasion:**

   - DLL hijacking is a technique used to gain code execution or maintain persistence on a system.

   - The fact that Tropic Trooper used this method to remove traces suggests that they are attempting to hide their activities from system administrators and security software.

2. **Command and Control Communication:**

   - C2 communication is crucial for maintaining control over compromised systems and exfiltrating data.

   - To avoid detection, malware authors often employ encryption to mask the content of their C2 traffic.

3. **Role of SSL in C2 Communication:**

   - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols used to encrypt data transmitted over the internet.

   - Using SSL for C2 communication can help malware authors evade network-based detection mechanisms that look for unencrypted malicious traffic.

4. **Likelihood of Using SSL:**

   - Given that Tropic Trooper has already employed stealthy techniques like DLL hijacking for defense evasion, it is plausible that they would also use encryption for their C2 communication to further hide their activities.

   - Many advanced malware families use SSL/TLS to encrypt their C2 traffic, making it difficult for network monitoring tools to inspect the content.

5. **Considering the Answer Choices:**

   - **A: Yes** - Suggests that it is likely TClient will use SSL for C2 communication.

   - **B: No** - Suggests that it is not likely.

Given the above reasoning, it seems more likely that TClient would use SSL for C2 communication to maintain the stealthiness of its operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
