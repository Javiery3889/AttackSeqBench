To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question describes a sequence of actions performed by attackers using a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), specifically NanoCore. The steps mentioned are:

1. Ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory without touching the disk for defense evasion.

2. Injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process.

3. Connecting the RAT back to its control server associated with the domain chickenkiller.com, which is owned by a free dynamic DNS service.

The question asks whether it is likely for the attackers to perform the third step, given the first two steps.

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory without touching the disk for defense evasion:**

   - This is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection by antivirus software and security tools that scan files on disk. By remaining in memory, the payload is less likely to be detected by signature-based defenses.

2. **Injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process:**

   - Process injection is another evasion technique where the malware injects its code into a legitimate process. This makes it harder to detect because the malware is masquerading as a normal system process.

3. **Connecting the RAT back to its control server associated with the domain chickenkiller.com owned by a free dynamic DNS service during command and control:**

   - Establishing a command and control (C2) channel is essential for the attackers to issue commands to the compromised system and exfiltrate data.

Now, considering that the first two steps are about evasion techniques to avoid detection, it is logical that the attackers would proceed to establish a C2 channel to control the compromised system.

Using a domain owned by a free dynamic DNS service is also a common practice among attackers because dynamic DNS services allow them to maintain a consistent domain name that points to frequently changing IP addresses. This helps them evade IP-based blocking and makes it harder for defenders to track and disrupt their C2 servers.

Given that the first two steps are about evading detection, it makes sense that the attackers would then proceed to establish a C2 channel to control the system. Therefore, it is likely that they would connect the RAT back to its control server.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
