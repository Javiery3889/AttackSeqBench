I've got this question here about a malware called KerrDown. It seems like it's delivered through malicious Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable something called DLL side-loading. Then, the question is asking if it's likely that the Office document will contain an image file that instructs the victim to enable macros, and then uses base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

So, first things first, I need to understand what KerrDown is. From what I know, KerrDown is a type of malware, specifically a backdoor, which allows attackers to maintain persistent access to an infected system. It's known for its use in targeted attacks, often delivered through spear-phishing emails.

Now, the delivery mechanisms mentioned are malicious Office documents with macros and RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading. Let's break these down.

Malicious Office documents with macros: These are Word or Excel files that contain macros—small programs—designed to perform malicious actions when enabled by the user. Often, these documents will have some enticing content to trick the user into enabling macros.

RAR archives with DLL side-loading: RAR is a popular archive file format. DLL side-loading is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in the same directory as a legitimate executable, taking advantage of how Windows searches for DLLs.

So, in this case, the RAR archive might contain a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL, arranged in a way that when the executable runs, it loads the malicious DLL instead of the intended one.

Now, the question is asking about the Office document specifically. It wants to know if it's likely that the Office document contains an image file that tells the user to enable macros, and then uses base64 encoded data to execute code based on the system architecture.

Let's think about this step by step.

First, it's common for malicious Office documents to contain images or text instructing the user to enable macros to view the content properly. This is a social engineering tactic to lower the user's defenses.

Next, using base64 encoding is a way to obfuscate code or data, making it less obvious to casual observers. It's a common technique used by malware authors to make their payloads harder to detect.

Regarding system architecture, malware often needs to determine whether the target system is 32-bit or 64-bit to execute the appropriate version of the payload. This is because different architectures require different binary formats.

So, putting it all together, it does seem plausible that a malicious Office document associated with KerrDown could contain an image prompting the user to enable macros, and then use base64 encoded blobs to execute code that is tailored to the victim's system architecture.

However, I should consider whether this is a likely approach for KerrDown specifically. Since KerrDown is a backdoor used in targeted attacks, it's reasonable to assume that the attackers would employ socially engineered documents with macros to gain initial access.

Moreover, using base64 encoding for the payload is a common obfuscation technique, and checking the system architecture to deliver the correct payload ensures compatibility and successful execution.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the answer seems to be "Yes," it is likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros and use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

But, to be thorough, I should consider if there are any reasons why this might not be the case.

One possible consideration is that if KerrDown is delivered via DLL side-loading through RAR archives, perhaps the Office document route might use different techniques. However, the question mentions both delivery methods, but asks specifically about the Office document.

Another thing to think about is whether KerrDown specifically uses base64 encoding for its payloads. While base64 is common, maybe in some variants, it uses different encoding methods. However, without specific intelligence on KerrDown's tactics, I have to go with general knowledge about malware delivery mechanisms.

In conclusion, given the information provided and general knowledge about malware delivery, it is likely that the Office document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros and uses base64 blobs to execute the payload based on system architecture.
