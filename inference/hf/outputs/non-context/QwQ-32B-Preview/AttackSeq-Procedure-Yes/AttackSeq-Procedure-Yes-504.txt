To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned and determine if the proposed sequence is plausible based on my knowledge of cybersecurity and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Campaign and Backdoor**: The question mentions the "CostaRicto Campaign" and its backdoor, "SombRAT."

2. **Discovery Phase Activities**: It states that SombRAT performed "process discovery" and "system information discovery" during the Discovery phase.

3. **Proposed Next Step**: After these discovery activities, the question asks if it's likely that the backdoor would communicate with C2 servers using "protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP" to establish a Command and Control channel.

My task is to evaluate whether this sequence of actions makes sense from a cybersecurity perspective.

### Step 1: Understanding the TTPs Mentioned

- **Process Discovery**: This is a technique where an adversary tries to get information about running processes on a system. It falls under the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

- **System Information Discovery**: Another Discovery technique where adversaries collect information about the system's environment, such as OS version, installed software, etc.

- **Command and Control (C2) Communication**: This is part of the Command and Control tactic, where adversaries establish communication channels back to their command centers to control compromised systems and exfiltrate data.

- **Protocol Tunneling over DNS and HTTP**: This refers to the method used to encapsulate C2 traffic within allowed protocols (DNS and HTTP) to evade network defenses.

### Step 2: Sequence Plausibility

After performing discovery activities, it's logical for an adversary to establish a C2 channel to further manipulate the compromised system or to exfiltrate data. Using protocol tunneling over allowed protocols like DNS and HTTP is a common technique to bypass firewalls and other network security measures.

### Step 3: Evaluating Answer Choices

- **Choice A: Yes**

  - This choice aligns with the typical sequence of events in a cyber attack. After gathering information about the system and its environment, establishing a C2 channel is a natural next step. Using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a stealthy method to avoid detection.

- **Choice B: No**

  - This choice suggests that the sequence is not plausible. However, based on standard attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this sequence makes sense.

### Step 4: Conclusion

Given the standard progression of a cyber attack and the techniques described, it is plausible that after performing discovery activities, the SombRAT backdoor would attempt to establish a C2 channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

**Final Answer: A**
