So I've got this question here about the Darkhotel APT and their tactics after deploying certain malware components. The question is: "After deploying malware components such as small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers to execute on victims' systems, is it likely that the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware?" And the answer choices are simply "A: Yes" and "B: No."

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The Darkhotel APT is a group known for their targeted attacks, often against high-profile individuals in the hospitality industry, hence the name "Darkhotel." They're known for using sophisticated malware and social engineering techniques to gain access to victims' systems.

The question mentions that they deploy several types of malware components: small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers. These are all tools used to gain initial access, collect data, and maintain a presence on the target system.

Now, the key part of the question is about whether it's likely that Darkhotel will maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware. Persistence mechanisms are crucial for APTs because they allow the attackers to maintain access to the system even after restarts or other interruptions.

Autorun registry settings are a common method for achieving persistence in Windows systems. By modifying certain registry keys, malware can ensure that it runs automatically when the system starts up. This is a well-known technique and is widely used by both malware authors and red teams.

Given that Darkhotel is an APT group, it's reasonable to assume that they would employ such techniques to maintain persistent access to the systems they compromise. APT groups are typically sophisticated and have the resources to implement robust persistence mechanisms.

Moreover, the question specifies "using autorun registry settings and malware." This suggests that the persistence would be achieved through a combination of modifying registry settings to auto-run malware upon system startup.

Looking back at the answer choices, A says "Yes" and B says "No." Based on my understanding of APT tactics and the specific practices of groups like Darkhotel, it seems likely that they would use such methods to maintain persistence.

To further support this, I can think about the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversarial tactics and techniques. Under the "Persistence" tactic, there are several techniques related to registry modifications and auto-starting mechanisms, which align with what's described in the question.

Therefore, considering the nature of APT groups and their need for persistent access, coupled with the specific methods mentioned, I believe the answer is "A: Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
