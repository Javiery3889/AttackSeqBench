To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if they align with known behaviors of the threat group FIN13, particularly focusing on their use of specific tools for privilege escalation and lateral movement.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Actions:**
   - Internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries and custom malware for discovery.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Use of tools like ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil.

3. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Employment of WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.

I need to evaluate if this sequence is plausible for FIN13.

**Step 1: Understanding FIN13**

FIN13, also known as APT28, Sofacy, or Strontium, is a Russian cyber espionage group known for targeting a wide range of sectors, including government, military, diplomatic, and commercial organizations. They are notorious for their sophisticated malware and social engineering techniques.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence of TTPs**

**a. Internal Reconnaissance:**

- **Native OS Binaries:** Threat actors often use built-in tools like PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and others for reconnaissance because they are less likely to trigger security alerts.

- **Custom Malware for Discovery:** FIN13 is known for developing custom malware, so this aligns with their capabilities.

**b. Privilege Escalation:**

- **ProcDump:** A sysinternals tool used to create process dumps, which can sometimes be abused to escalate privileges, though it's not their primary use.

- **Mimikatz:** A well-known tool for credential dumping, which is a common method for privilege escalation.

- **Certutil:** A built-in Windows utility that can be used for various tasks, including downloading and executing malicious files.

**c. Lateral Movement:**

- **WMI:** A powerful feature in Windows for managing and interacting with other systems on the network, often used for lateral movement.

- **Custom Web Shells like BUSTEDPIPE:** FIN13 has been known to use custom web shells for maintaining persistent access and moving laterally within a network.

**Step 3: Evaluating Plausibility**

Given that FIN13 is known for using a combination of living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) and custom malware, the initial actions described align with their modus operandi.

For privilege escalation, using tools like Mimikatz is standard practice for many threat groups, including FIN13, to obtain higher-level credentials.

ProcDump, while not primarily designed for privilege escalation, can be abused in certain scenarios. However, its use in this context might be less common compared to more direct methods.

Certutil is another tool that FIN13 has been known to use for executing malicious code, which can be part of their privilege escalation or other stages.

Regarding lateral movement, WMI is a favorite among many threat groups due to its effectiveness and integration within Windows environments. Custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE also fit with FIN13's toolkit, as they provide flexible and stealthy methods for maintaining access and moving laterally.

**Step 4: Cross-Referencing with MITRE ATT&CK Framework**

To further validate this sequence, I can look at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which catalogs adversary tactics and techniques.

- **Reconnaissance:** Technique T1592 (Query Registry) and T1087 (Account Discovery).

- **Resource Development:** Technique T1584 (Adversary-in-the-Middle).

- **Initial Access:** Technique T1190 (Web Shell).

- **Execution:** Technique T1204 (User Execution).

- **Persistence:** Technique T1133 (External Remote Services).

- **Privilege Escalation:** Technique T1056 (Input Capture), T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation).

- **Defense Evasion:** Technique T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host).

- **Credential Access:** Technique T1003 (OS Credential Dumping), T1056 (Input Capture).

- **Discovery:** Technique T1087 (Account Discovery), T1135 (Network Share Discovery).

- **Lateral Movement:** Technique T1021 (Remote Services), T1071 (Application Layer Protocol), T1029 (Client Server Application).

Given this framework, the sequence described in the question aligns with multiple techniques documented in ATT&CK.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Based on the analysis of FIN13's known tactics and the alignment with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
