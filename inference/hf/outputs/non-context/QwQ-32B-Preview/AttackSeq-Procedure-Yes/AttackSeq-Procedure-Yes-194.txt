So I've got this question here about a cyber attack sequence involving SparrowDoor and I need to figure out if it's likely that SparrowDoor will use an encrypted HTTPS channel for command and control after being executed via cmd.exe commands following a remote code execution exploit. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events described in the question:

1. **Initial Access:** The attacker exploits remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain initial access to the target system.

2. **Execution:** Once inside, the attacker runs cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor on the system.

Now, the question is asking about the likelihood that SparrowDoor will communicate with its command and control (C&C) server using an encrypted HTTPS channel.

To answer this, I need to consider a few things:

- **What is SparrowDoor?** I'm not entirely sure about this specific malware name. It might be a hypothetical or less-known variant. However, in general, malware these days often uses HTTPS for C&C communications to evade detection and to blend in with normal web traffic.

- **Common Malware Behavior:** Modern malware strains frequently employ encryption for their C&C communications to avoid being intercepted or blocked by network security measures. HTTPS is a popular choice because it's widely used and expected in normal web traffic.

- **Indicator of Compromise (IoC):** Using HTTPS for C&C can make it harder for defenders to detect malicious traffic, as encrypted traffic is difficult to inspect without decrypting it, which can be resource-intensive and may require additional configurations.

- **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):** From a TTP perspective, using encrypted channels for C&C is a sophisticated technique that many advanced persistent threats (APTs) and even some less sophisticated malware use.

Given these points, it seems plausible that SparrowDoor, or any malware executed in this manner, would use an encrypted HTTPS channel for C&C communications.

However, I should also consider that not all malware uses HTTPS for C&C. Some may use other protocols or even plain HTTP, especially if they target environments where HTTPS is not commonly used or if the malware authors are not concerned about advanced detection mechanisms.

But in the context of this question, where the attacker has taken the time to exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities and execute SparrowDoor via cmd.exe, it suggests a level of sophistication that would likely include using encrypted communications to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

Therefore, considering the common practices in malware development and the tactics used by attackers, I think the most plausible answer is "Yes," it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for command and control.

**Final Answer: A**
