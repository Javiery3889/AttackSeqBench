I'm going to tackle this question step by step. So, the question is about whether it's likely that attackers launched DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure,' based on the observation that FireEye saw two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDoS C2 servers in this campaign.

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like there's some evidence from FireEye about the encryption methods used in the attack, specifically two different single-byte XOR keys for encoding configuration files on the command and control (C2) servers. The question is linking this to DDoS attacks against specific types of websites and a specific incident involving Next Media's network failure.

So, my task is to evaluate whether this observation about the XOR keys makes it likely that such attacks occurred. To do this, I need to consider a few things:

1. **Understanding XOR Encryption in this Context:** XOR encryption is a simple way to obfuscate data. Using single-byte keys means that the encryption is relatively weak but easy to implement. The fact that two different keys were used suggests that there might be some variation in the configuration files or possibly different stages/phases of the campaign.

2. **Relevance of Encryption Keys to Attack Targets:** The encryption method used for configuration files doesn't directly tell us about the targets of the DDoS attacks. However, it could be indicative of the attacker's tactics or the specific tools they are using.

3. **Linking Encryption Observations to Specific Attacks:** To determine if these observations relate to attacks on democracy-promoting websites in Hong Kong and Next Media's network failure, I need to see if there's any direct or indirect connection between the encryption method and these specific incidents.

4. **Considering Plausibility:** Even if the encryption method is consistent with DDoS attacks in general, I need to assess whether it's plausible that these specific attacks occurred based on this evidence alone.

Let me think about this carefully. FireEye is a reputable cybersecurity firm, so their observations carry weight. If they've observed two different single-byte XOR keys in the configuration files of DDoS C2 servers, it suggests that there is a DDoS campaign underway, and the use of different keys might indicate that there are multiple operators or different phases in the attack.

However, the question is specifically about whether this makes it likely that attackers launched DDoS attacks against democracy-promoting websites in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure.' To answer this, I need to see if there's a direct link between the encryption method and these specific targets and outcomes.

Upon reflection, the observation about the XOR keys is more about the method of obfuscation used in the configuration files, not about the targets themselves. While it's possible that these attacks were targeted at democracy-promoting websites in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network failure, the evidence provided—namely, the use of two different single-byte XOR keys—doesn't directly support this conclusion.

There could be many reasons for using different XOR keys, and it doesn't necessarily correlate to the specific targets or the impact on Next Media's network. Without additional information linking the encryption keys to these targets or the network failure, it's speculative to conclude that such attacks occurred based solely on this observation.

Therefore, I would lean towards answering "No" to the question, meaning that it's not likely to conclude that these specific attacks occurred based solely on the observation of two different single-byte XOR keys in the configuration files.

**Final Answer: B**
