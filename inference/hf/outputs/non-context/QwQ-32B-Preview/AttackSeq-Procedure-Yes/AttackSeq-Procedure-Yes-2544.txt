To answer this question, I need to analyze the behavior of the Milestone backdoor and determine if it is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 (Command and Control) channel after performing certain actions on an infected system.

First, let's understand what a backdoor is. A backdoor is a type of malware that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a computer system without being detected. Backdoors often have various capabilities, including the ability to execute commands, steal data, and maintain persistence on the compromised system.

Now, focusing on the Milestone backdoor specifically, I need to consider its known functionalities. Since the question mentions that it can discover system information and capture screens, it's likely that these are some of its capabilities. Discovery capabilities typically involve gathering information about the system, such as operating system version, installed software, network configuration, and other details that could be useful for the attacker.

Capturing screens refers to the ability to take screenshots or record the user's activities on the infected system. This can be used to gather sensitive information, monitor user behavior, or capture credentials being entered into applications.

Given these capabilities, the next step is to determine if exfiltrating data over the C2 channel is a likely action for this backdoor. Exfiltration involves transferring stolen data from the compromised system to the attacker's server or another location under their control.

In the context of malware behavior, it's common for backdoors to have exfiltration capabilities. After all, one of the primary goals of many cyberattacks is to steal sensitive information. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that a backdoor with discovery and screen capture capabilities would also have the ability to exfiltrate the data it collects.

Moreover, the fact that the backdoor has a C2 channel suggests that it can communicate with the attacker's server. This communication channel is typically used to receive commands from the attacker and to send back data or status updates.

Considering the above points, it's likely that the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing screens. The attacker would probably want to retrieve the information collected by these activities to achieve their objectives, which could include espionage, theft of intellectual property, or other malicious purposes.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
