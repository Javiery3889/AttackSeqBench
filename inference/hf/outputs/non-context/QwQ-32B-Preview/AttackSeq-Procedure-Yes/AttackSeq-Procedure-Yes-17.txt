To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and determine whether the subsequent activities mentioned are likely given the initial steps taken by the "Machete" malware.

First, let's break down the initial actions of the malware:

1. **Establishing Persistence:**
   - Creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe'.
   - Installs itself in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.

These actions suggest that the malware is trying to ensure it runs automatically when the system starts and is disguised to look like legitimate software. Using a .lnk file and placing it in the Startup folder or a similar location would allow it to run at startup. The choice of names like 'Java Update.lnk' and 'Jre6/java.exe' is likely an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate Java update, which could trick users or security software into thinking it's harmless.

Now, the question is whether, after these steps, it is likely that the malware will proceed to log keystrokes, capture audio from the computer's microphone, and hijack the clipboard to collect information.

Let's consider each of these activities:

- **Keystroke Logging:** This is a common tactic used by malware to capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. It's a straightforward way to gather valuable information from the target machine.

- **Audio Capture:** Capturing audio from the computer's microphone can provide additional information about the user's environment, conversations, or other audio-based activities that might be of interest to an attacker. This can be useful for espionage or to gain more context about the target.

- **Clipboard Hijacking:** The clipboard is often used to transfer data between applications. Hijacking the clipboard allows the malware to capture data that the user copies or pastes, which could include passwords, URLs, or other sensitive information.

Given that the malware has already established persistence on the system, it would make sense for it to proceed with these information-gathering activities. These tactics are all aligned with the goal of collecting as much sensitive data as possible from the target machine.

Therefore, it is likely that after establishing persistence, the "Machete" malware would proceed to log keystrokes, capture audio, and hijack the clipboard.

**Final Answer: A**
