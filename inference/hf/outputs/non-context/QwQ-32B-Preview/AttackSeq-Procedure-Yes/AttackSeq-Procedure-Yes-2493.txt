To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the sequence makes sense based on my knowledge of malware behavior, specifically regarding the Black Energy 2 malware.

First, let's break down the sequence mentioned in the question:

1. **Inject a DLL into the svchost.exe process to maintain persistence.**

2. **The botnet's command-and-control (C2) center communicates with the malware through HTTP requests.**

I need to evaluate whether these steps are logically ordered and typical for Black Energy 2.

**Step 1: DLL Injection into svchost.exe for Persistence**

DLL injection is a common technique used by malware to gain persistence and elevate privileges. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various system services, making it an attractive target for injection because it is trusted and often running with system-level privileges.

Black Energy 2, being a sophisticated malware, is known to employ various techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection. DLL injection into system processes like svchost.exe is plausible for this purpose.

**Step 2: C2 Communication via HTTP Requests**

After establishing persistence, malware typically needs to communicate with its C2 servers to receive commands or upload stolen data. Using HTTP for C2 communication is common because HTTP traffic is usually allowed through firewalls and proxies, making it less likely to be blocked.

Black Energy 2 has been observed using HTTP for C2 communications, employing techniques to blend in with normal web traffic and avoid detection.

**Sequence Plausibility**

The sequence described seems plausible:

- First, the malware injects a DLL into svchost.exe to gain persistence and elevate privileges.

- Then, it establishes communication with the C2 server via HTTP to receive further instructions or upload data.

This sequence aligns with typical malware behavior, where persistence is established before initiating C2 communications to ensure the malware remains operational even after system reboots or other interruptions.

**Conclusion**

Given the above analysis, it is likely that Black Energy 2 would inject a DLL into svchost.exe for persistence before communicating with its C2 through HTTP requests.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
