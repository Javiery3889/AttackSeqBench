I've got this question here about some cyber threat stuff. It mentions something called 'IPsec Helper' backdoor and communication with C2 servers over HTTP. Then it talks about updating relays or downloading files, and eventually deploying wipers like 'Apostle', which was turned into ransomware to destroy data on targeted systems. The question is whether this sequence is likely, and I have to choose between "Yes" and "No."

First, I need to understand the terms and the sequence of events here. 'IPsec Helper' sounds like a backdoor tool that attackers use to maintain access to a system. IPsec is Internet Protocol Security, which is used for securing Internet traffic, so an 'IPsec Helper' could be a tool that assists in setting up or maintaining IPsec tunnels, but in this case, it's being used maliciously as a backdoor.

C2 servers are command and control servers; these are the servers that attackers use to communicate with the compromised systems, giving commands and receiving data. Communication over HTTP means they're using web protocols to send and receive data, which is common because HTTP traffic is usually allowed through firewalls.

Updating relays or downloading files would be part of the attacker's activities once they have access. Relays might be other systems that help in routing traffic to avoid detection or to reach internal networks. Downloading files could be for various purposes, like exfiltrating data or deploying more malware.

Then, the question mentions deploying wipers like 'Apostle', which was later turned into ransomware. A wiper is a type of malware designed to destroy data on a system, making it unusable. Ransomware is similar but also encrypts data and demands a ransom for the decryption key.

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. Use 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP.

2. Perform activities like updating relays or downloading files.

3. Eventually, deploy wipers like 'Apostle', which was turned into ransomware to destroy data.

Now, is this sequence likely?

Well, in cyber attacks, attackers often follow a sequence of steps. They gain initial access, establish persistence, perform reconnaissance, lateral movement, and finally, achieve their objective, which could be data exfiltration, disruption, or extortion.

Using a backdoor like 'IPsec Helper' to maintain communication with C2 servers is a common tactic. Updating relays could be part of maintaining their access or setting up more pathways into the network. Downloading files could be for various purposes, including preparing for the final attack.

Deploying wipers or ransomware makes sense as the final step, especially if the attacker's goal is to cause disruption or financial gain.

However, the question specifies that 'Apostle' was "later turned into functioning ransomware." This suggests that initially, 'Apostle' was a wiper, designed to destroy data, and then it was modified to also encrypt data and demand a ransom.

So, in the context of the attack sequence, if the attackers are deploying 'Apostle' as a wiper to destroy data, and then it's being turned into ransomware, it's a bit confusing. Did they deploy the wiper first and then the ransomware, or is 'Apostle' itself being transformed from a wiper to ransomware?

I think the latter is more plausible. Perhaps 'Apostle' was originally designed as a wiper, but in this particular attack, it was modified or updated to also function as ransomware.

Given that, the sequence makes sense:

- Initial access and persistence using 'IPsec Helper'.

- Updating relays and downloading necessary files to prepare for the main attack.

- Deploying 'Apostle', which is a wiper turned into ransomware, to destroy data and potentially extort money.

So, is this sequence likely? Yes, it aligns with common attack patterns where attackers gain access, maintain persistence, perform necessary preparations, and then execute their primary malicious activity, which in this case is deploying destructive malware like wipers or ransomware.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
