So I've got this question here, and I need to choose between "Yes" and "No." The question is: "After using phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion to further phishing campaigns within a client's supply chain, is it likely that threat actors targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya cyber-attacks will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts?" Okay, let's break this down.

First, it mentions that threat actors use phishing emails to get into a client's system and then expand their phishing campaigns within the supply chain. So, they start with phishing and then use that access to do more phishing inside the supply chain. Then it asks if these threat actors, who are targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya, will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance phase.

So, to answer this, I need to think about what typically happens in a cyber-attack, especially one that involves targeting specific entities like SolarWinds and Kaseya, which are known for large-scale supply chain attacks.

Reconnaissance is the initial step in any cyber-attack where threat actors gather information about their target to plan their attack effectively. It's like spying on the target to find weaknesses and decide how to exploit them.

In the context of SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks, these were massive supply chain attacks where threat actors compromised software updates, which then allowed them to access thousands of organizations that used those products.

Given that, it's highly likely that threat actors would engage in information gathering about the victim organizations as part of their reconnaissance. This helps them understand the target's environment, identify high-value assets, and plan their attack vectors accordingly.

Phishing is often used as an initial intrusion vector because it's effective in getting human users to unwittingly give access to the attackers. Once inside, threat actors can move laterally within the network and potentially access supply chain partners through the client's systems.

So, if they're already using phishing to get in and then expanding their reach within the supply chain, it makes sense that they would also gather as much information as possible about the victim organization to enhance their attack strategies.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that threat actors will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

Wait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any reason why they wouldn't gather this information. But honestly, I can't think of any. Reconnaissance is a standard part of any well-organized cyber-attack. Skipping this step would likely lead to less effective attacks and higher chances of getting detected.

Moreover, in the case of SolarWinds and Kaseya, the attacks were highly sophisticated and targeted. Such operations usually involve thorough reconnaissance to ensure success.

So, unless the threat actors are extremely reckless or inexperienced, which doesn't seem to be the case given the scale and sophistication of the SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks, they would definitely engage in information gathering during reconnaissance.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
