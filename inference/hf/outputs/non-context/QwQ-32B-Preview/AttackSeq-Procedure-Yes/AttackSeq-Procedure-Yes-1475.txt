To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the exfiltration method mentioned aligns with typical attacker behavior following the initial backdoor activity.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Backdoor Activity**: The SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute.

2. **Exfiltration Method**: Attackers create archive files of users' Desktop folders, build CAB files, and post download links to a Slack channel.

I need to determine if this exfiltration method is likely after the initial discovery phase.

**Step 1: Understanding the Backdoor's Discovery Phase**

- **Downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub**: Gists are a way to share small snippets of code or notes. Attackers might use them to host command lists or configurations that the backdoor executes.

- **Parsing for commands to execute**: The backdoor reads the gist and executes the commands listed therein. These commands could be for various purposes, including further reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

**Step 2: Evaluating the Exfiltration Method**

- **Creating archive files of Desktop folders**: This suggests that the attackers are targeting user data stored on desktops, which could contain sensitive information.

- **Building CAB files**: CAB (Cabinet) files are a Microsoft archive format, similar to ZIP files, used for compressing and storing files.

- **Posting download links to a Slack channel**: Instead of directly exfiltrating the data, the attackers are leaving links in a Slack channel, possibly for another actor or tool to pick up.

**Step 3: Assessing Plausibility**

I need to consider whether this sequence of actions makes sense in the context of a cyber attack.

- **Initial Discovery**: The backdoor performs discovery by executing commands from a gist. This is a common technique for maintaining operational security, as it allows attackers to update commands without modifying the backdoor itself.

- **Data Exfiltration**: Creating archives of desktop folders and using CAB files for compression is a plausible method for打包和传输数据。CAB files are less common than ZIP files but are still effective for this purpose.

- **Using Slack for Coordination**: Posting download links in a Slack channel introduces an interesting element. Slack is a communication platform, and using it for exfiltration suggests that the attackers are integrating their operations with legitimate tools, possibly to blend in with normal traffic.

However, there are a few points to consider:

- **Visibility and Detection**: Using a public channel like Slack for exfiltration links might raise red flags, as it's not a typical method for data exfiltration. Attackers usually prefer more covert channels to avoid detection.

- **Operational Security**: Exchanging exfiltration links in a Slack channel could expose the attackers' infrastructure if the channel is monitored.

- **Efficiency**: Directly exfiltrating the data through the backdoor or using a dedicated exfiltration channel might be more efficient and less risky.

**Step 4: Considering Alternatives**

- **Direct Exfiltration**: The backdoor could directly send the archived data to an external server controlled by the attackers.

- **Staging Servers**: Data could be uploaded to a staging server, and then transferred to the final destination.

- **Encrypted Channels**: Using encrypted channels or protocols to exfiltrate data without drawing attention.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Given the information provided, the exfiltration method described—creating archive files of desktop folders, building CAB files, and posting download links to a Slack channel—seems somewhat unusual but not entirely implausible. However, considering the potential risks and inefficiencies involved, it might not be the most likely approach for sophisticated attackers.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
