To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the context provided:

1. **Aria-body backdoor**: This is a tool used by the Naikon APT group for initial access and persistence on a target system.

2. **Discovery tactic**: This is part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which outlines various stages of an attack. The Discovery tactic involves an attacker gathering information about the compromised system and the network it's connected to.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: This is another stage in the ATT&CK framework where the attacker maintains control over the compromised system, often by sending commands and receiving data.

The question is asking whether, after using the Aria-body backdoor for discovery, the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for C2 communications.

Let's consider each part:

- **HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is commonly used for web communications and is often allowed through firewalls, making it a stealthy choice for C2.

- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol is a reliable network protocol that ensures data is transmitted without errors.

Given that Aria-body is a backdoor, it's designed to provide a channel for the attacker to communicate with the compromised system. It's likely that such a backdoor would use common protocols like HTTP over TCP to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.

Moreover, the Naikon APT group is known for using such techniques. They often employ backdoors that use standard protocols to exfiltrate data and receive commands.

Therefore, it's plausible that after using Aria-body for discovery, they would continue to use HTTP over TCP for C2.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the above reasoning, the most appropriate answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
