To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if it's plausible that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees using njRAT, and then use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

First, let's break down the components mentioned:

1. **SideCopy**: This is a threat actor group known for targeting entities in India, particularly government and military organizations. They are associated with cyber espionage activities.

2. **njRAT**: Also known as Bladabindi, is a remote access trojan (RAT) that provides attackers with extensive control over an infected machine, including the ability to steal credentials and other sensitive information.

3. **GoLang-based file recon plugins**: GoLang is a programming language often used in malware development due to its efficiency and cross-platform capabilities. File recon plugins would be used to search and identify specific files on the compromised system for exfiltration.

4. **Kavach authentication databases**: Kavach is a two-factor authentication (2FA) system used by the Indian government. Its databases contain authentication data crucial for securing government communications and services.

Now, let's look at the sequence of events described:

- **Credential Access using njRAT**: njRAT can indeed be used to steal credentials, including those for email accounts, web applications, and other services. Targeting Indian government employees' access credentials would be a strategic move to gain deeper access to government networks and data.

- **Exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases**: After gaining access, the threat actor would look for sensitive data to exfiltrate. Kavach databases are high-value targets because compromising them could allow the actor to bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to various government systems.

Given that SideCopy has a history of targeting Indian government entities and that njRAT is a capable tool for credential theft, it is plausible that they would use this combination to gain initial access and then look for specific sensitive data like Kavach databases.

Moreover, using GoLang-based file recon plugins makes sense as it allows for efficient and stealthy searching and exfiltration of specific files across different platforms.

Therefore, considering the alignment of the threat actor's known targets, the capabilities of the tools mentioned, and the strategic value of the data being targeted, it is likely that SideCopy would follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
