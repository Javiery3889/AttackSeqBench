To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine whether it's plausible that malicious JavaScript was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, which then exploited a specific vulnerability in Google Chrome, leading to the use of heap spraying techniques for executing shellcode.

First, let's break down the sequence of events as per the question:

1. Malicious JavaScript is inserted into a Korean-language news portal.

2. This JavaScript redirects victims to an exploit landing page.

3. The landing page exploits CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

4. After exploiting the vulnerability, heap spraying techniques are used to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode.

I need to assess whether this sequence is likely, given the information provided.

Step 1: Understanding the components

- **Malicious JavaScript in a news portal:** It's plausible that a news portal could be compromised to host malicious JavaScript, especially if the portal has vulnerabilities in its content management system or if an attacker gains access to the server.

- **Redirect to an exploit landing page:** Once the malicious JavaScript is executed, it can redirect the user's browser to another page designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities in the browser.

- **Exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome:** CVE-2019-13720 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This type of vulnerability is serious and can be exploited to gain control over the browser.

- **Heap spraying and shellcode execution:** Heap spraying is a technique used to increase the chances of successful code execution by filling the heap with copies of the exploit code, making it more likely that the execution will land in the shellcode.

Step 2: Evaluating the sequence

- The sequence starts with compromising a news portal by inserting malicious JavaScript. This is a common tactic used by attackers to reach a broad audience.

- The JavaScript then redirects users to an exploit landing page. This is a standard procedure in drive-by download attacks, where the attacker tricks the user into visiting a page that contains exploit code.

- The landing page exploits a specific vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2019-13720). Given that the vulnerability is a use-after-free error, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, it's reasonable to assume that successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute code on the victim's machine.

- After exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker uses heap spraying to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode. Heap spraying is often used in such scenarios to make the exploitation more reliable, especially in the presence of address space layout randomization (ASLR).

Step 3: Assessing plausibility

- The sequence seems logically consistent with known attack patterns. Attackers often use drive-by download techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers.

- Inserting malicious JavaScript into a news portal is a feasible initial step, as many websites have been compromised in the past through various means, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or server vulnerabilities.

- Exploiting a specific vulnerability like CVE-2019-13720 is plausible, especially if the vulnerability is zero-day or if the majority of users are running an unpatched version of the browser.

- Using heap spraying to execute shellcode is a common technique in exploit development to bypass security mechanisms and ensure reliable code execution.

Given this analysis, it seems likely that such a sequence of events could occur in a real-world attack scenario.

Step 4: Considering alternative perspectives

- One might argue that modern browsers have robust security features that could prevent such attacks. However, even with these defenses, vulnerabilities can still be exploited, especially if the user is running an outdated version of the browser.

- Additionally, social engineering plays a significant role in such attacks. Users might be tricked into visiting compromised websites or failing to keep their browsers updated.

- The specificity of the vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) suggests that the attackers have knowledge of this particular flaw, which could indicate a targeted attack or the use of exploit kits that include known vulnerabilities.

Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the sequence of events described in the question is plausible. It aligns with known attack patterns and techniques used by cybercriminals to compromise systems through web browsers.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
