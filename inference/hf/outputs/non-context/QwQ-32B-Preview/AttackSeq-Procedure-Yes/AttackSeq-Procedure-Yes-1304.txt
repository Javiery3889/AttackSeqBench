To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions attributed to the threat actor SWEED and determine the plausibility of the described attack sequence. The question posits that SWEED exploited CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, followed by data collection from the local system after employing defense evasion techniques like software packing and deletion of the original file. I need to assess whether this sequence is likely based on known threat actor behaviors and the characteristics of the mentioned techniques.

First, let's break down the components of the question:

1. **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882**: This is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office Equation Editor, which allows remote code execution. It's a known exploit that threat actors can use to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Silent code execution**: This refers to the execution of code without the user's knowledge or detection by security systems.

3. **Defense evasion techniques**:
   - **Software packing**: This is a method to obfuscate malware by compressing and encrypting its code, making it harder for antivirus software to detect.
   - **Deletion of the original file**: After execution, the threat actor deletes the initial exploit file to reduce the chances of it being discovered or analyzed.

4. **Data collection from the local system**: After gaining access and evading defenses, the threat actor proceeds to collect data from the compromised system.

Now, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes threat actor behaviors, I can map these actions to specific tactics and techniques:

- **Initial Access**: Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 falls under the "Exploitation of Vulnerabilities" technique (T1203).

- **Execution**: Silent code execution is part of the "Execution" tactic (T1204).

- **Defense Evasion**:
  - Software packing is related to "Obfuscated Files or Information" (T1027).
  - Deletion of the original file can be considered under "Indicator Removal on Host" (T1070).

- **Collection**: Data collection from the local system is covered under the "Data from Local System" technique (T1560).

Given this mapping, the sequence described seems logical and aligns with common threat actor behaviors. Typically, after gaining initial access and executing code, threat actors will take steps to evade detection and then proceed to collect data or perform other objectives.

However, to make a more informed decision, I should consider the specific characteristics of the threat actor SWEED. SWEED is likely a typo or misnomer; there might be confusion with well-known threat groups like APT groups or ransomware operators. Assuming SWEED is a typo and the intended reference is to a known threat actor, I would need to research their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). But since SWEED doesn't correspond to any known threat group, I'll proceed with the general assumptions about threat actor behaviors.

Moreover, CVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, and exploiting it typically allows for code execution. After gaining execution, threat actors often employ defense evasion techniques to persist on the system and avoid detection. Data collection is a common后续步骤，尤其是对于间谍软件或勒索软件等威胁行为者。

因此，根据已知的威胁行为者行为和MITRE ATT&CK框架中的技术，这个攻击序列是合理的。所以，答案应该是“是的”，这种序列是可能的。
