So I've got this question here about a zero-day exploit and some security protections. Let's break it down step by step. The question is a bit technical, but I think I can handle it.

First, the scenario describes an attack that uses corrupted Flash vector objects to access memory and execute shellcode to make memory executable during the exploitation phase. Then, it asks whether this exploit is likely to bypass ASLR and DEP protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation as part of defense evasion.

Okay, let's start by understanding what each of these terms means.

ASLR stands for Address Space Layout Randomization. It's a security mechanism that randomly rearranges the memory positions of key data areas of a process, making it harder for attackers to predict where their exploit code will be located in memory.

DEP stands for Data Execution Prevention. It's a security feature that marks certain areas of memory as non-executable, meaning that code cannot be run from those areas. This prevents an attacker from executing code injected into a program's memory, such as shellcode.

EAF likely stands for Exploit Amendment Framework, but I'm not entirely sure. It might be a typo or a less common term. Given the context, perhaps it's related to some kind of exploit mitigation or amendment framework. I might need to look that up later, but for now, I'll assume it's a type of defense mechanism that the exploit needs to bypass.

So, the question is asking if, after using corrupted Flash vector objects to access memory and execute shellcode to make memory executable, the zero-day exploit is likely to bypass ASLR and DEP before trying to bypass EAF as part of defense evasion.

Let's think about the sequence of events in an exploit.

Typically, an exploit needs to overcome various security protections to successfully compromise a system. ASLR and DEP are two common protections that exploits need to bypass.

In this case, the exploit is using corrupted Flash vector objects to access memory and execute shellcode to make memory executable. This suggests that the exploit is already attempting to bypass DEP by making previously non-executable memory regions executable.

Now, regarding ASLR, bypassing it often requires some kind of information leakage or predictable behavior in the system to determine the memory addresses where the exploit code can be injected and executed.

So, the question is whether this exploit, which is already executing shellcode to make memory executable, is likely to bypass ASLR and DEP before attempting to bypass EAF.

Given that ASLR and DEP are more fundamental protections that need to be bypassed for an exploit to be successful, it makes sense that an exploit would first handle these before dealing with other mitigations like EAF.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that the exploit will bypass ASLR and DEP before attempting to bypass EAF.

But let's consider the alternative.

If the answer is "No," that would imply that the exploit attempts to bypass EAF before bypassing ASLR and DEP. However, ASLR and DEP are more基础的安全机制，而EAF可能是一种更高级的或特定的防御机制。因此，从逻辑上讲，应该先 bypass ASLR 和 DEP，然后再处理其他防御机制。

此外，根据攻击的典型流程，攻击者通常会首先处理基本的保护措施，如 ASLR 和 DEP，因为如果没有 bypass 这些，后续的攻击步骤可能无法执行。

因此，基于这些理由，我认为答案应该是 "Yes"。

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
