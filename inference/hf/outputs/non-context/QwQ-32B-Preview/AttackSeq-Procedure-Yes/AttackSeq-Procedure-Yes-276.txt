To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine the plausibility of the actions taken by the attacker, specifically focusing on the use of the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script and its relationship to the 'sdmc.jpg' file and the subsequent download of a zip file containing malware components.

First, let's break down the attack sequence as described:

1. **Initial Access Vector:** A malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file is used to gain initial access. This is a common social engineering tactic where victims are tricked into opening the document, which then executes malicious code.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Script:** The 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script is mentioned as being involved in the attack. PowerShell is frequently used in malware due to its powerful capabilities and ease of use for scripting.

3. **Decoding and Execution of Base64 Encoded Script:** The script is supposed to decode and execute a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'. This suggests that the actual malicious payload is obfuscated within an image file, likely to evade detection.

4. **Download of Malware Payload Components:** After executing the decoded script, the PowerShell script then downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload. This indicates a multi-stage infection process, where initial access leads to downloading additional malware components.

Now, let's evaluate the plausibility of this sequence:

- **Use of Malicious Document for Initial Access:** It's very common for attackers to use malicious Office documents, especially Word documents, as initial infection vectors. These documents often contain macros or exploit vulnerabilities in the software to execute malicious code.

- **PowerShell Script Execution:** Once the document is opened, it may execute a PowerShell script, possibly by invoking PowerShell with specific commands or by downloading a script from a remote location.

- **Decoding and Executing Obfuscated Script:** Storing a base64 encoded script within an image file is a tactic used to hide malicious code. The PowerShell script would need to extract the encoded script from the image, decode it, and then execute it. This adds an additional layer of obfuscation to evade antivirus software and analysis.

- **Downloading Additional Payload Components:** After executing the initial script, it's common for malware to download additional components or a more substantial payload from a command and control (C2) server. This allows attackers to keep their initial payload small and less conspicuous, while retaining the ability to deliver more functionality later.

Given this sequence, it is plausible that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script would first decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before downloading additional malware components. This sequence allows the attacker to establish a foothold, execute necessary setup or evasion techniques via the decoded script, and then retrieve more substantial parts of the malware.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
