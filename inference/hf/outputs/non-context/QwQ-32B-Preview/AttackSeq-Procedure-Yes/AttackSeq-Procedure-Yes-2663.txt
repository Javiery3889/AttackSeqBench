To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether it's likely that the infected computers communicated with the command and control (C2) server at the specified domain and IP address.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. Attackers executed 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' on SK Communications computers to establish backdoor access.

2. Additional malware was installed to access user databases.

3. The question asks if it's likely that these infected computers communicated with the C2 server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the IP address 116.127.121.41.

Now, I need to consider the relationship between these events and the likelihood of communication with the C2 server.

Backdoor.Agent.Hza is a type of malware designed to provide backdoor access to an infected system. Typically, such backdoors are controlled through a C2 server, where attackers can issue commands and receive data from the infected machines.

The installation of additional malware to access user databases suggests that the attackers are seeking to exfiltrate sensitive information. This kind of activity usually requires communication with a C2 server to transmit the stolen data.

The domain 'update.alyac.org' resolving to the IP address 116.127.121.41 is likely the C2 server's address. It's common for malware to use domains that resolve to specific IP addresses for command and control purposes.

Given this context, it's reasonable to assume that the infected computers would communicate with the C2 server to receive instructions and transmit data back to the attackers.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
