To answer this question, I need to analyze the behavior of the Derusbi malware and see if it aligns with the described activities, specifically whether it uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and includes HTTP POST requests to a specific URL path (/photos/photo.asp) in its command and control (C2) interactions after gathering system information and beaming it via port 443.

First, I should understand what Derusbi malware is known for. Derusbi, also known as Darkhotel or Vawtrak, is a malware strain that has been used in targeted attacks, often against high-profile individuals or organizations. It's known for its C2 communication and information theft capabilities.

Port 443 is typically used for HTTPS communication, which is encrypted and commonly used for web traffic to provide a layer of security. It's plausible that Derusbi uses this port to blend in with normal web traffic and avoid detection.

Now, regarding HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication: Beaconing is a technique where malware periodically sends information to a C2 server to check for new commands or to report its status. Obfuscating this communication makes it harder for security measures to detect the malicious traffic.

HTTP POST requests to a specific URL path like /photos/photo.asp suggest that the malware is communicating with the C2 server using a specific endpoint. This could be a way to hide the C2 communication within legitimate-looking web traffic.

To determine if this is likely behavior for Derusbi, I need to look into known characteristics of the malware.

Upon reviewing available resources and CTI reports, Derusbi is known to use HTTPS for C2 communication, which aligns with the use of port 443. It also employs various techniques to hide its C2 traffic, including mimicking legitimate web traffic.

Obfuscating communication is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection by network security solutions. Derusbi, being a sophisticated threat, likely employs such techniques.

Regarding the specific URL path (/photos/photo.asp), without specific intelligence on Derusbi using this exact path, it's hard to confirm. However, malware often uses benign-looking URL paths to blend in with normal traffic.

Given that Derusbi is known to use HTTPS for C2 communication and employs techniques to hide its traffic, it is plausible that it uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and includes specific URL paths in its requests.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

Final Answer: A
