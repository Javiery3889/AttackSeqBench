To answer this question, I need to analyze the behavior described and determine if it aligns with typical malware operations, specifically focusing on information theft from SNS applications, data encryption using AES, and communication with C2 servers via non-standard ports.

First, let's break down the components of the question:

1. **Stealing information from SNS applications:** SNS stands for Social Networking Services. Malware targeting these applications to steal information is plausible, as SNS apps often contain sensitive user data. Malware designed for information theft would logically target such applications.

2. **Encrypting data using AES:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used and secure encryption algorithm. It's common for malware to encrypt stolen data to prevent detection and to ensure that the data remains confidential during transmission. Using AES is a standard practice in both legitimate and malicious software for encryption.

3. **Communicating with C2 servers using non-standard ports:** C2 (Command and Control) servers are used by malware to receive instructions and exfiltrate data. Using non-standard ports can help malware evade network monitoring and firewall rules that might be set to block or monitor standard ports. Ports like UDP 6999 or TCP 55556 are indeed non-standard and less likely to be monitored closely.

Now, let's consider these components in sequence:

- **Stealing information from SNS applications:** This is a plausible step for malware aimed at gathering sensitive user data.

- **Encrypting this data using AES:** It makes sense for malware to encrypt stolen data to protect it during transmission and to avoid detection by security systems that might look for patterns in plaintext data.

- **Communicating with C2 servers using non-standard ports:** This is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection and to establish a covert channel for data exfiltration and receiving commands.

Given this analysis, the sequence described—stealing information from SNS applications, encrypting it with AES, and communicating with C2 servers using non-standard ports—is consistent with known malware behaviors.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
