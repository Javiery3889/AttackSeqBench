To answer this question, I need to analyze whether the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the Carbanak group makes sense based on known information about their operations and the tools they use.

First, let's break down the sequence of events described in the question:

1. **Use of Cobalt Strike beacon**: Cobalt Strike is a popular commercial tool used by red teams and, unfortunately, by attackers for command and control (C2) operations. It's known for its versatility and effectiveness in maintaining persistence and controlling compromised systems.

2. **Mapping the organization's internal network**: After gaining initial access, attackers typically seek to understand the network topology to identify high-value targets and plan their movements within the network.

3. **Collecting administrative-level credentials**: With network maps in hand, attackers look for credentials that can provide them with higher levels of access, such as domain administrator credentials, which can give them near-complete control over the network.

4. **Compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator**: Once administrative credentials are obtained, attackers can use them to move laterally and compromise additional systems, effectively controlling the entire domain.

Now, considering the Carbanak group:

- Carbanak is a sophisticated cybercrime group known for targeting financial institutions worldwide. Their operations are highly organized and involve a deep understanding of their targets' environments.

- They are known to use a variety of tools and techniques, including custom malware and living-off-the-land binaries, to maintain stealth and persistence.

- Cobalt Strike is a tool that has been used by various threat groups, including some nation-state actors and advanced cybercriminal groups, due to its effectiveness and flexibility.

Given this context, is it likely that Carbanak used Cobalt Strike in this manner?

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Tool Usage**: Cobalt Strike is a sophisticated tool that aligns with the capabilities of the Carbanak group. Their operations require stealth and flexibility, which Cobalt Strike provides.

2. **Network Mapping**: It's standard procedure for attackers to map the network after gaining initial access. Cobalt Strike has features that facilitate network discovery and mapping.

3. **Credential Harvesting**: Collecting administrative credentials is a key step in advancing privileges within a network. Carbanak has demonstrated an ability to escalate privileges and move laterally within networks, which would require such credentials.

4. **Domain Administrator Compromise**: Obtaining domain administrator credentials is the holy grail for many attackers as it provides broad access and control over the network. It's logical that after collecting administrative-level credentials, the next step would be to compromise domain administrator accounts.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the known capabilities and tactics of the Carbanak group.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
