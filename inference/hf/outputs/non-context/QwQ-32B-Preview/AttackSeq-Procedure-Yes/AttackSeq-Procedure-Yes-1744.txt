To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned and evaluate whether the given answer choices align with the described attack sequence.

First, let's break down the question:

- TG1021 employed a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.

- The question is whether, after this action, they demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. TG1021 uses custom Potato family tools for privilege escalation.

2. After privilege escalation, they remove all disk-resident tools to evade detection.

I need to determine if this sequence is plausible and choose the appropriate answer from A or B.

Let's consider each part:

1. **Using custom Potato family tools for privilege escalation:**

   - The Potato family refers to a set of tools used by threat actors, particularly in the context of cyber espionage or attacks.

   - Custom versions suggest that TG1021 has modified these tools to suit their specific needs or to evade detection.

   - Privilege escalation is a common tactic where an attacker tries to gain higher-level access to a system, often to install backdoors or perform more damaging actions.

2. **Removing disk-resident tools for defense evasion:**

   - Defense evasion techniques are used by attackers to avoid detection by security systems.

   - Removing tools from the disk can help eliminate artifacts that could be detected by antivirus software or forensic analysis.

   - This action suggests that TG1021 is trying to clean up their tracks to avoid leaving evidence of their activities.

Now, considering these points, is it likely that TG1021 would remove all disk-resident tools after using them for privilege escalation as part of their defense evasion strategy?

In many cyber attack scenarios, threat actors do employ defense evasion techniques to cover their tracks and avoid detection. Removing tools from the disk is one such technique. However, the effectiveness of this approach can vary depending on the specific tools used and the sophistication of the defense mechanisms in place.

Given that TG1021 is using a custom version of the Potato family tools, it's plausible that they are attempting to be stealthy and avoid detection. Therefore, removing disk-resident tools after privilege escalation aligns with a defense evasion strategy.

However, I should consider whether removing all disk-resident tools is feasible or effective in all cases. Some tools might be necessary for maintaining access or for further stages of the attack. Additionally, simply removing tools from the disk may not entirely eliminate all traces of the attack, as other artifacts such as registry entries, memory residues, or logs could still indicate malicious activity.

Despite these considerations, the question is whether it's likely that they demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools. Given that defense evasion is a common tactic, and removing tools is a specific technique within that tactic, the answer seems to be yes, it is likely.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
