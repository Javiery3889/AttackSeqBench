To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the sequence proposed in the question is plausible based on known cyber threat actor behaviors, particularly focusing on the use of webshells, RDP, and custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

First, let's break down the sequence of events as described in the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting public-facing applications.

2. **Lateral Movement:** Using RDP after uploading webshells.

3. **Execution:** Deploying custom malware, such as the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

4. **Persistence:** Registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service and deploying webshells on compromised systems.

I need to determine if this sequence is likely, given the understanding of how attackers typically progress through a network.

**Step 1: Initial Access via Public-Facing Applications**

This is a common entry point for many threat actors. Public-facing applications, such as web servers, email servers, or remote access services, are often targeted because they are exposed to the internet and may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

**Step 2: Lateral Movement using RDP after uploading webshells**

Once initial access is gained, attackers often look to move laterally within the network to access more sensitive areas. Using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a typical technique for lateral movement, especially in Windows environments. Webshells can be used to upload and execute files on the server, which could include tools for RDP exploitation.

**Step 3: Execution of Custom Malware ('IPsec Helper' backdoor)**

After gaining access and moving laterally, attackers may deploy custom malware to maintain access and perform specific actions. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is mentioned here, which seems like a specific piece of malware designed for this purpose.

**Step 4: Persistence by Registering 'IPsec Helper' as a Service and Deploying Webshells**

To ensure long-term access, attackers establish persistence mechanisms. Registering a backdoor as a service is a standard method to ensure it runs automatically at system startup. Additionally, deploying webshells on compromised systems provides another entry point and a way to maintain access.

Now, evaluating the sequence:

- Initial access through public-facing applications makes sense.

- Using webshells to upload tools for RDP-based lateral movement is plausible.

- Deploying custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for execution is likely.

- Establishing persistence by registering the backdoor as a service and maintaining webshells is a common practice.

However, the question is whether this sequence is "likely" for Agrius, assuming Agrius is a specific threat actor group. Without specific knowledge about Agrius's TTPs, I have to rely on general threat actor behaviors.

Given that the sequence aligns well with typical attack patterns, it is likely that Agrius, or similar threat actors, would follow such a sequence.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
