To answer this question, I need to analyze the behavior of the malware PROMETHIUM as described and determine the likelihood of it encoding and splitting archives before exfiltration.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. **Malware Name:** PROMETHIUM

2. **Action during Collection phase:**

   - Searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives using a document search module.

3. **Question about Exfiltration phase:**

   - Is it likely that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server?

Now, I need to consider whether these actions (encoding with an unusual scheme and splitting into chunks) are typical or plausible for malware like PROMETHIUM during the exfiltration phase.

**Step 1: Understanding the Collection Phase**

- PROMETHIUM targets Microsoft Office files, compresses them into archives. This suggests that the malware is designed to collect specific types of data that are likely to contain sensitive information.

**Step 2: Considering the Exfiltration Phase**

- Exfiltration is the process of transferring stolen data from the compromised system to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.

- To remain undetected, malware often employs various techniques to obfuscate the data being exfiltrated.

**Step 3: Evaluating the Plausibility of Encoding with an Unusual Scheme**

- Encoding data can serve multiple purposes, such as compressing the data further, making it harder to detect by network security tools, or simply preparing it for transmission.

- Using an "unusual scheme" might refer to employing less common or custom encoding methods that are not easily recognizable by security solutions.

- It is plausible that advanced malware like PROMETHIUM would use uncommon encoding schemes to evade detection.

**Step 4: Evaluating the Plausibility of Splitting Archives into Chunks**

- Splitting large archives into smaller chunks can help in several ways:

  - **Avoiding Large Data Transfers:** Security tools might be more likely to flag large, unusual data transfers. Smaller chunks are less conspicuous.

  - **Resuming Interrupted Transfers:** If a transfer is interrupted, resuming from where it left off is easier with chunked data.

  - **Parallel Transfers:** Chunks can be sent simultaneously over multiple connections, speeding up the exfiltration process.

- These benefits make splitting archives into chunks a reasonable strategy for exfiltrating data without drawing attention.

**Step 5: Considering the Likelihood of Both Actions Together**

- Combining encoding with an unusual scheme and splitting into chunks would provide dual benefits: the data is obfuscated and the transfer is less likely to be detected due to the smaller, potentially more frequent data packets.

- This combination of techniques aligns with the tactics used by sophisticated malware to ensure successful and stealthy exfiltration of sensitive data.

**Step 6: Making a Decision Based on the Analysis**

- Given that both encoding with an unusual scheme and splitting into chunks are plausible and beneficial tactics for exfiltrating data stealthily, it is likely that PROMETHIUM would employ these methods.

- Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
