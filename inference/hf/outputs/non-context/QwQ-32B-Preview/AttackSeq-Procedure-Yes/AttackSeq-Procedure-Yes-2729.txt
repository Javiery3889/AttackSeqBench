To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the Lazarus group and determine if the described sequence is plausible based on known behaviors.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access and Credential Access:**
   - The Lazarus group uses the Responder tool to acquire login credentials. Responder is a well-known tool that can capture credentials by responding to NTLM authentication requests on a network.

2. **Discovery Activities:**
   - After gaining credential access, the group is likely to conduct discovery activities, specifically system service discovery.

3. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Following discovery, they use Windows commands and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) for lateral movement to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.

Now, let's evaluate each part of this sequence and see if it aligns with known Lazarus group TTPs.

**Step 1: Initial Access and Credential Access**

- **Responder Tool:**
  - Responder is a legitimate tool often used in penetration testing but can be repurposed for malicious activities. It's known for capturing credentials over a network.
  - Lazarus group has been observed using various tools for credential harvesting, including custom and publicly available tools.

**Step 2: Discovery Activities**

- **System Service Discovery:**
  - After gaining access, adversaries typically perform discovery to understand the environment better. This includes enumerating system services, users, shares, and more.
  - The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists "System Service Discovery" as a sub-technique under the "Discovery" tactic.
  - Lazarus group has been known to perform extensive discovery activities to map the network and identify high-value targets.

**Step 3: Lateral Movement**

- **Windows Commands and WMIC:**
  - Using native Windows commands and tools like WMIC for lateral movement is a common tactic to avoid detection by security solutions.
  - WMIC can be used to query and manage systems remotely, making it a useful tool for lateral movement.
  - Lazarus group has been observed using native tools and commands for lateral movement in past campaigns.

Given this sequence:

1. **Credential Access via Responder**
2. **Discovery (System Service Discovery)**
3. **Lateral Movement using Windows commands and WMIC**

This sequence aligns with typical adversary behavior and is consistent with known Lazarus group TTPs.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**

- **Option A: Yes**
  - This option suggests that the sequence is plausible.

- **Option B: No**
  - This option suggests that the sequence is not plausible.

Based on the analysis above, the sequence described in the question is indeed plausible for the Lazarus group.

**Final Answer: A**
