So I've got this question here, and it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

First, it mentions "Longhorn gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware." Okay, so Longhorn is likely a group or an entity that's launching this attack. They're using a previously unknown vulnerability in a Word document to get Plexor malware onto the target's system. Plexor is probably the name of the malware they're using for this infection.

Next, it asks, "is it likely that their tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery?" So, after gaining initial access, the question is whether these attackers would follow certain guidelines to stay hidden, specifically referring to the Vault 7 documents, and then proceed to do system fingerprinting to learn more about the target's environment.

Vault 7 is a series of documents leaked by WikiLeaks in 2017 that detailed the CIA's hacking tools and techniques. These documents likely include guidelines on how to operate stealthily within a target's network without being detected.

So, the question is essentially asking whether, after getting in through this zero-day exploit, the malware would follow the CIA's tactics for remaining undetected while it starts to gather information about the system it's on.

Now, let's look at the answer choices: A: Yes and B: No.

I need to decide which one is more plausible.

First, consider that Longhorn is using a zero-day exploit, which is a high-value, undisclosed vulnerability. Using such an exploit suggests that they are a sophisticated actor with access to advanced capabilities.

Plexor is the malware they're using for infection. Assuming that Plexor is designed by Longhorn, it's possible that it's crafted to be stealthy and follow certain best practices for avoiding detection.

Now, the Vault 7 documents outline the CIA's tactics for remaining undetected. It's possible that Longhorn is aware of these tactics and designs their tools to follow similar guidelines to avoid detection.

On the other hand, Longhorn might have their own set of tactics that differ from the CIA's. Alternatively, they might not be concerned about following specific guidelines from Vault 7.

But the question is about the likelihood that they follow such guidelines.

Given that Vault 7 provides detailed insights into advanced tactics for stealth and persistence, it's reasonable to assume that sophisticated actors like Longhorn would be aware of these techniques and possibly incorporate them into their own operations.

Furthermore, after gaining initial access, performing detailed system fingerprinting is a common step in the attack lifecycle. This helps the attacker understand the environment, identify valuable assets, and plan further steps.

However, system fingerprinting can be risky because it involves interacting with the system in ways that might trigger security alerts. Therefore, following guidelines to minimize detection risk is crucial.

So, considering that Longhorn is likely a sophisticated actor using advanced malware, and that following guidelines like those in Vault 7 would help them remain undetected during system fingerprinting, it seems plausible that they would follow such guidelines.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

But let me think about this a bit more to make sure.

First, Longhorn is using a zero-day exploit, which indicates sophistication. They're likely well-resourced and knowledgeable about advanced tactics.

Second, Plexor is their malware, so they have control over how it operates post-exploitation.

Third, Vault 7 provides a set of best practices for remaining undetected, which would be valuable for any attacker trying to prolong their access and minimize the risk of being caught.

Given all that, it makes sense that Longhorn would design Plexor to follow similar guidelines to avoid detection, especially when performing activities like system fingerprinting, which can be noisy.

Therefore, I think A: Yes is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
