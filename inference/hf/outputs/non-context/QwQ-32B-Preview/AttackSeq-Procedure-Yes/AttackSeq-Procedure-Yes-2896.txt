To answer this question, I need to analyze the scenario described and evaluate whether it's plausible that the 'yty' framework would exfiltrate specific types of data using certain plugins after disguising its C2 communications.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Framework and Communication Disguise:**
   - The 'yty' framework is using a football-themed strategy to disguise its Command and Control (C2) communications.
   - It exchanges beacon messages and receives instructions from the C2 server.

2. **Data Exfiltration:**
   - The question asks if it's likely that this framework will exfiltrate specific data types: file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots.
   - It mentions that this exfiltration would be done using plugins like 'abode.exe.'

My task is to determine whether this sequence of actions is plausible, given the information provided.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Understanding the 'yty' Framework:**
   - The 'yty' framework is presumably a malware or cyber threat tool.
   - It employs sophisticated methods to communicate with its C2 server, using a football-themed strategy to hide its activities.

2. **C2 Communication Disguise:**
   - Disguising C2 communications is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection.
   - A football-themed strategy might involve using terminology or patterns related to football to make network traffic appear benign.

3. **Beacon Messages and Instructions:**
   - Beaconing is a technique where malware periodically sends status updates to the C2 server and receives new instructions.
   - This indicates an active communication channel between the infected system and the attacker.

4. **Data Exfiltration Plugins:**
   - The question mentions specific data types: file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots.
   - These are typical targets for malware aiming to steal sensitive information.
   - The mention of 'abode.exe' as a plugin suggests that there are modular components within the framework designed for specific exfiltration tasks.

**Evaluation of Plausibility:**

- **Likelihood of Data Exfiltration:**
  - Given that the framework has established a disguised C2 communication channel and is receiving instructions, it is plausible that the next step would be to exfiltrate data.
  - Malware operations often follow a sequence: infiltration, command and control, reconnaissance, and data exfiltration.

- **Specific Data Types:**
  - File listings, keystrokes, and screenshots are valuable to attackers for various purposes:
    - File listings can help attackers understand the structure of the compromised system and identify files of interest.
    - Keystrokes can capture passwords, sensitive communications, and other critical information.
    - Screenshots provide visual context of the user's activities and can reveal information not captured by keystrokes alone.

- **Use of Plugins:**
  - Modular malware often uses plugins to perform specific functions, which can be updated or changed without altering the core framework.
  - 'abode.exe' seems to be one such plugin, likely designed for data exfiltration tasks.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, it is indeed likely that after establishing disguised C2 communications, the 'yty' framework would proceed to exfiltrate data such as file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots using plugins like 'abode.exe.' This sequence aligns with common malware behavior and operational phases.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
