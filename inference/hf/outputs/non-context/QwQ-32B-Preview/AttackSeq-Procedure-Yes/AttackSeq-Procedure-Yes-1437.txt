So I've got this question here about ProjectM actors and their tactics. Let's break it down step by step. First, it mentions that they conducted reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains. That sounds like they were doing some preliminary research to find potential victims. So, they're gathering intelligence about who to go after.

Next, the question suggests that they might have performed spear-phishing campaigns and hosted watering hole sites to deliver initial payloads. Spear-phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers send personalized messages to specific individuals to trick them into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. Watering hole attacks, on the other hand, involve compromising a website that the target is known to visit, in order to infect their system with malware.

Then, it mentions that after these initial steps, they moved forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy. Trojans are types of malware that are disguised as legitimate software but perform malicious actions once installed on a system.

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. Reconnaissance: Identifying targets through open sources.

2. Initial access: Spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to deliver payloads.

3. Execution: Installing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

Now, I need to evaluate whether this sequence is likely based on what I know about ProjectM actors.

First, I need to recall who ProjectM is. ProjectM is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat group, also known by names like APT10, MenuPass, and CVNX. They are known for their espionage activities, particularly targeting industries like technology, healthcare, and government sectors.

From what I've read about ProjectM, they are indeed known for conducting extensive reconnaissance to identify their targets. They look for specific individuals or organizations that possess the information they want to steal.

Regarding their initial access vectors, spear-phishing is a common tactic used by many APT groups, including ProjectM. They craft convincing emails that appear to come from trusted sources, enticing the recipient to click on malicious links or open infected attachments.

Watering hole attacks are also a technique used by sophisticated threat actors. By compromising websites that the target frequently visits, they can infect the target's system without needing to directly target the individual.

Once they gain initial access, APT groups like ProjectM typically deploy various types of malware to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. Trojans are a common choice because they can perform a variety of functions, from keylogging to data exfiltration.

Specifically, Crimson and Peppy are mentioned as Trojans used by ProjectM. I need to verify if these are indeed malware associated with this group.

After a quick search, I find that Crimson and Peppy are malware variants attributed to ProjectM. Crimson is a backdoor Trojan that provides remote access to the compromised system, while Peppy is another Trojan used for similar purposes.

Given this information, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the known tactics of ProjectM actors. They conduct reconnaissance, use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks for initial access, and then deploy Trojans like Crimson and Peppy to maintain persistent access and steal data.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that they performed these sequences of tactics.

But let's consider if there might be any reasons to choose "No." Maybe there's some information I'm missing or some nuances in their modus operandi that don't fit this sequence.

Upon further reflection, I don't recall any specific instances where ProjectM deviated from this pattern. Their operations typically involve detailed reconnaissance, targeted phishing, and the use of custom malware for persistent access.

Additionally, CTI reports often highlight the use of phishing and watering hole attacks as primary initial access vectors for APT groups. So, it's consistent with broader trends in cyber espionage.

Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**
