I've got this question here about the Phantom Menace attackers and their tactics. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attackers have persisted on the system by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity. That sounds like they've established a foothold and are ensuring that their malicious activities keep running regularly.

Now, the next part is about whether it's likely that these attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores before uploading those credentials to an external FTP server they control.

So, I need to think about the sequence of tactics here and see if this makes sense in the context of what's been described.

Let's consider the answer choices: A is Yes, and B is No.

I need to decide which one is more plausible based on the information given.

First, let's think about why attackers would want to collect credentials. Credentials are valuable because they can be used to access other systems, escalate privileges, or maintain persistent access. So, it's a common tactic for attackers to harvest credentials.

Now, using legitimate applications to collect these credentials could be a way to blend in with normal system activities, making their actions less suspicious. This is known as living off the land, where attackers use existing tools on the system to carry out their objectives.

Password stores could be things like the Windows Credential Manager, password managers, or configuration files that store usernames and passwords.

After collecting these credentials, uploading them to an external FTP server makes sense because attackers need a way to exfiltrate the data they've collected.

So, in terms of the sequence:

1. Persist on the system by running batch files every hour.

2. Use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores.

3. Upload these credentials to an external FTP server.

Does this sequence make sense?

Well, persistence is usually established early on in an attack to ensure that the attacker can maintain access over time. Then, once they have persistent access, they might look for valuable data, such as credentials, to further their goals.

Using legitimate applications to collect credentials is a stealthy approach, as it reduces the chances of detection by security systems that might flag unknown or unusual tools.

Uploading the collected credentials to an external server is a standard exfiltration method.

So, overall, this sequence seems plausible.

But, let's consider if there's any reason to think otherwise.

One thing to consider is whether the attackers would need to use legitimate applications to collect credentials. Maybe they have their own tools for this purpose. However, using legitimate applications can be more effective in avoiding detection, as it doesn't introduce new tools that might be flagged by security software.

Additionally, the question specifies that the attackers are using legitimate applications for this purpose, so it's likely that they are trying to maintain a low profile.

Another point is that they are uploading the credentials to an external FTP server. FTP is a common protocol, but it's worth noting that FTP traffic can be monitored or intercepted, so using a more secure protocol might be preferable for attackers. However, for the sake of this question, it's stated that they are using FTP, so we'll accept that as given.

Given all this, it seems reasonable to conclude that yes, it is likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores before uploading them to an external FTP server they controlled.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

But, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where the answer might be B: No.

Perhaps if the attackers had already exfiltrated all the data they needed and were in the process of covering their tracks, they might not engage in further credential harvesting. However, the question suggests that they are still active and persisting on the system, so it's plausible that they are continuing to collect credentials.

Another scenario could be if the system didn't have any password stores or if the attackers didn't have the necessary permissions to access them. But the question states that they are collecting credentials from password stores, so we have to assume that such stores exist and are accessible.

Additionally, if the attackers were concerned about detection and FTP was monitored, they might choose a different exfiltration method. But again, the question specifies FTP, so we'll go with that.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is likely that the attackers would follow this sequence of tactics.

So, my final answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
