I've got this question here about some cyber threat stuff. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, there's this thing called the "Dropping Elephant backdoor," and apparently, it's involved in some sort of attack where it evades defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts to download additional malware. Then, the question is asking whether, after doing all that, it's likely to iterate through password stores and steal the user's Google Chrome credentials.

First, I need to break down the question and understand the terms. A backdoor is a method that an attacker uses to maintain access to a computer or a network. "Dropping Elephant" seems to be a specific type of backdoor, but I don't know much about it beyond what's stated here. The attack involves evading defenses by using encoded blobs that are decoded into PowerShell scripts, which then download more malware.

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language used in Windows systems, and it's often abused by attackers because it's widely available and can execute a lot of functionality directly. Encoding blobs is a way to obfuscate the actual commands, making them harder to detect by security software.

So, the sequence here is:

1. Evade defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts.

2. Use these scripts to download additional malware.

Now, the question is asking if, after these steps, the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to iterate through password stores and steal Google Chrome credentials.

I need to think about what typically happens in such attacks. Usually, backdoors are designed to provide ongoing access to a system, and they might include various modules or functionalities. Stealing credentials, especially browser credentials, is a common activity because it can give attackers access to email, online accounts, and other sensitive information.

Google Chrome stores its credentials in a specific way, often encrypted, and there are known methods to extract them, even when they're protected. So, it's plausible that a backdoor like Dropping Elephant could include functionality to steal Chrome credentials.

But, the question is whether it's "likely" to do so after the specific steps mentioned. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

Given that the backdoor has already gone through the trouble of evading defenses and downloading additional malware, it's reasonable to assume that it would also attempt to harvest useful information from the compromised system, including browser credentials.

Therefore, my initial thought is that yes, it's likely.

However, I should consider if there's any reason to think otherwise. Maybe the backdoor has a specific purpose that doesn't involve stealing credentials, or perhaps the attack is focused on something else, like installing ransomware or conducting a different type of attack.

But based on the information provided, there's no indication that the attack has a narrow focus that would exclude credential theft. In fact, stealing credentials is a common practice in many types of attacks, as it can provide further access and opportunities for the attacker.

So, considering all that, I think the most plausible answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**
