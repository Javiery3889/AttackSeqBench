To answer this question, I need to analyze the relationship between the obfuscation and encryption techniques used by QuasarRAT and its communication with a C2 server.

First, let's understand the context:

- **QuasarRAT**: This is a type of Remote Access Trojan (RAT), which is malware that allows an attacker to control an infected machine remotely.

- **Obfuscation and Encryption Techniques**:

  - **CppHostCLR**: This is a technique used to host the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in a C++ application, which can be used to obfuscate the code and make it harder for security tools to analyze.

  - **ConfuserEx**: This is a code protection and obfuscation tool for .NET applications, which can make the code more difficult to reverse-engineer.

- **AES-128 Encrypted Channels**: Advanced Encryption Standard with a 128-bit key is a strong encryption method used to secure communications between the malware and its C2 server.

Now, the question is asking whether, after using these obfuscation and encryption techniques to evade detection, it is likely that QuasarRAT will communicate with its C2 server using AES-128 encrypted channels as specified in its configuration.

Let's break this down:

1. **Obfuscation and Encryption for Evasion**:

   - The use of CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx suggests that the malware authors are trying to make the malware harder to detect and analyze by security researchers and antivirus software.

2. **Communication with C2 Server**:

   - Once the malware is executed on a target machine, it needs to communicate with its C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

   - To maintain secrecy and integrity of this communication, malware often uses encryption.

3. **AES-128 Encryption**:

   - AES-128 is a widely used and secure encryption standard.

   - Using AES-128 for C2 communication is common among malware authors to prevent interception and analysis of the traffic.

Given this information, it is reasonable to assume that if QuasarRAT has gone to the lengths of using multiple obfuscation and encryption techniques to evade detection, it would also use secure communication channels with its C2 server.

Therefore, it is likely that QuasarRAT will communicate with its C2 server using AES-128 encrypted channels as specified in its configuration.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
