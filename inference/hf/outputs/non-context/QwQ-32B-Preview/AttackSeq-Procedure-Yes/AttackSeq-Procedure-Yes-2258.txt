To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Cosmic Banker attack and determine if the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file is likely to execute a PowerShell script before establishing persistence through specific methods.

First, let's break down the attack sequence as described:

1. **Initial Access:** The attack starts with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, which delivers malicious attachments.

2. **Execution:** The malicious attachment is a .bat file named COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat.

3. **Persistence:** The attack establishes persistence by creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

The question is asking whether, in this sequence, the .bat file is likely to execute a PowerShell script before setting up persistence.

To evaluate this, I need to consider the typical behavior of malware and the capabilities of batch files and PowerShell.

**Batch Files and PowerShell:**

- Batch files (.bat) are scripts that can execute commands in the Windows Command Prompt.

- PowerShell is a more powerful scripting language that can perform a wide range of tasks, including interacting with the Windows API, managing system configurations, and executing complex operations.

It's common for malware to use batch files as initial execution vectors because they are simple and can be easily disguised or obfuscated. However, for more sophisticated operations, malware often resorts to PowerShell due to its extensive capabilities.

**Sequence of Events:**

1. **Initial Execution:** The user opens the malicious email and runs the .bat file.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Script:** The .bat file may contain commands to execute a PowerShell script, possibly downloaded from a remote server or embedded within the batch file.

3. **Establishing Persistence:** After executing the PowerShell script, the malware may set up persistence mechanisms, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and modifying scheduled tasks.

Given this sequence, it is plausible that the .bat file executes a PowerShell script before setting up persistence. Here's why:

- **Batch File Limitations:** Batch files have limitations in terms of functionality compared to PowerShell. For more advanced tasks, such as creating complex persistence mechanisms, PowerShell is a better tool.

- **Modularity:** Malware authors often design their attacks in a modular fashion, where initial access is gained through a simple vector (like a batch file), and then more sophisticated components are downloaded and executed.

- **Obfuscation and Evasion:** Using PowerShell can help malware authors evade detection, as PowerShell scripts can be obfuscated and are less likely to be flagged by antivirus software compared to executable files.

Now, let's look at the persistence mechanisms mentioned:

- **Shortcuts in Startup Folder:** This is a common method for achieving persistence, as shortcuts in the startup folder are executed when the user logs in.

- **Manipulating Scheduled Tasks:** Scheduled tasks can also be used for persistence, allowing the malware to run at specific times or under certain conditions.

These persistence mechanisms can be set up by the PowerShell script executed by the batch file. Therefore, the sequence makes sense:

1. The batch file is executed by the user.

2. The batch file runs a PowerShell script, which performs more advanced tasks.

3. The PowerShell script sets up persistence through shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

Given this analysis, the answer is likely "Yes," meaning that the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file is likely to execute a PowerShell script before establishing persistence by creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.
