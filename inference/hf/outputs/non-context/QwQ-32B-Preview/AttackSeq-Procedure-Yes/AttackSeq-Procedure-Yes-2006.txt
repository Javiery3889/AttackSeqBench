So I've got this question here about whether it's likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution, especially after some reconnaissance activities. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events described in the question. It mentions reconnaissance activities, which are initial steps that attackers take to gather information about their target. This could involve collecting publicly available data on the systems, maybe looking at the company's website, social media, or even using tools to scan the network for open ports or vulnerable services. Active discovery methods might include things like port scanning or attempting to map the network topology.

Next, the question talks about installing malicious implants, specifically mentioning BlackEnergy 3. BlackEnergy is a type of malware that has been used in various cyber attacks, often for espionage or sabotage. It's known for its modular design, which allows attackers to add different capabilities depending on their goals.

The implant is said to be installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution. This suggests that the attack likely involved phishing emails with malicious attachments, where employees are tricked into enabling macros in documents, which then execute the malware.

Now, the key part of the question is whether it's likely that after all this, the malware will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers. C2 servers are the channels through which attackers control the malware once it's inside the target network. This is crucial for the attackers to issue commands, receive data, update the malware, or even exfiltrate information.

Given that BlackEnergy is a sophisticated piece of malware, it's designed to perform these kinds of activities. Establishing communication with C2 servers is a standard functionality for such malware. It allows the attackers to maintain persistence and control over the infected systems.

So, considering all this, it seems highly likely that after the malware is installed through the described method, it would attempt to communicate with C2 servers. This is a typical behavior for malware in order to receive further instructions or upload stolen data.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

But let's think about possible scenarios where this might not happen. Maybe if the malware is configured to lay dormant until a specific trigger, or if there are network restrictions that prevent it from communicating outward. However, these seem like exceptions rather than the rule.

In most cases, especially with malware like BlackEnergy, which is known for its C2 capabilities, it's safe to assume that it will try to establish communication with its C2 servers once installed.

So, I think "Yes" is the correct answer here.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
