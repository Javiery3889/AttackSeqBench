So I've got this question here about phishing and cyber attacks on Instagram accounts. Let's break it down step by step to understand what's being asked and evaluate the answer choices accordingly.

First, the question describes a scenario where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to send phishing messages. These messages claim things like copyright violations or offer verified badges, which are likely just ploys to trick users into giving away their credentials.

Then, it asks whether, after such an initial phishing attempt, it's likely that attackers will use phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials. After collecting this information, the attackers would presumably use it to lock out the original account owners by changing the account passwords.

So, the sequence here is:

1. Impersonate trusted entities (technical support or friends).

2. Send phishing messages with alarming or enticing claims (copyright violations or verified badges).

3. Direct victims to phishing sites to enter their credentials.

4. Use the collected credentials to log into the Instagram accounts.

5. Change the account passwords to lock out the original owners.

Now, I need to evaluate whether this sequence is likely, given what I know about phishing and cyber attacks.

First, phishing is a common tactic used by attackers to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Phishing often involves impersonating a trusted entity to gain the victim's trust.

In this case, impersonating technical support or friends makes sense because these are entities that users are likely to trust. Claiming copyright violations could be a scare tactic to prompt immediate action from the victim, while offering verified badges might be a way to entice victims with something desirable.

Next, directing victims to phishing sites to collect their credentials is a standard phishing practice. These sites are designed to look legitimate, often replicating the login pages of well-known services like Instagram, to trick users into entering their details.

Once the attackers have the credentials, they can log into the accounts and perform various actions, including changing the passwords to lock out the original owners. This is a common goal in account takeover attacks, where the objective is to gain control of the account for malicious purposes, such as identity theft, posting malicious content, or selling the account on the dark web.

Given this sequence, it seems highly plausible that attackers would follow this path. It aligns with known phishing tactics and the objectives of account takeover attacks.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the analysis above, the sequence described in the question is indeed likely, given the modus operandi of phishing attacks and the goals of account takeover.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Yes.

However, to ensure there are no nuances I'm missing, let's consider if there might be any reasons to choose B: No.

One might argue that Instagram has security measures in place to prevent such attacks, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or account recovery processes. That's true, but unfortunately, not all users enable 2FA, and even when they do, determined attackers may find ways to bypass or exploit weaknesses in those systems.

Additionally, phishing attacks can sometimes be sophisticated enough to collect 2FA codes or trick users into providing them. However, this is beyond the scope of the initial sequence described in the question.

Another consideration is whether Instagram's system would detect and prevent account takeovers. While Instagram does have mechanisms to protect user accounts, no system is foolproof, and successful account takeovers do occur.

Furthermore, the question is about the likelihood of attackers attempting this sequence, not necessarily about the success rate of such attempts. Attackers often try methods that have a chance of success, even if not all attempts are successful.

In conclusion, given the alignment of the described sequence with known phishing tactics and the objectives of account takeover attacks, it is indeed likely that attackers would follow this sequence.

Final Answer: A
