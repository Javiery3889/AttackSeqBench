I've got this question here about Hidden Cobra and their tactics. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Hidden Cobra targets Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with malicious Word documents exploiting CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access. So, they're using phishing to get into these organizations' systems.

Then, it asks if it's likely that Hidden Cobra will develop "Bankshot" implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files, under the tactic of Resource Development.

Okay, so we need to think about whether, given their initial attack method, they would develop these specific capabilities.

Let's start by understanding what Hidden Cobra is. Hidden Cobra is a nickname used by the US Department of Justice and other agencies to refer to a group of hackers believed to be linked to the North Korean government. They are known for various cyber attacks, including the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 and the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017.

Now, regarding the attack vector mentioned: spear phishing emails with malicious Word documents exploiting CVE-2018-4878. CVE-2018-4878 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office Word that allows remote code execution. So, by exploiting this CVE, attackers can run malicious code on the victim's system when they open the document.

Alright, so they're using phishing to get in, exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability to execute code on the target system. That makes sense as an initial access vector.

Next, the question is about whether they will develop "Bankshot" implants with certain capabilities under the tactic of Resource Development.

First, I need to understand what "Bankshot" implants are. A quick search suggests that Bankshot is a malware family associated with Hidden Cobra, specifically designed to target financial institutions. It's known for its capabilities to exfiltrate data and conduct espionage activities.

So, if Hidden Cobra is already developing Bankshot implants for financial targets, it's plausible that they would enhance these implants with more capabilities, especially if it aligns with their objectives.

The specific capabilities mentioned are:

1. Give attackers full control over victim systems.

2. Wipe files from the targeted system.

Under the tactic of Resource Development.

Let's look at what Resource Development means in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques.

In MITRE ATT&CK, Resource Development is a tactic under the Enterprise matrix. It involves adversary activities focused on acquiring the resources needed to plan and execute their operations. This can include developing tools, improving infrastructure, or enhancing their capabilities.

So, in this case, developing Bankshot implants with enhanced capabilities like full system control and file wiping would fall under Resource Development, as they are improving their tools to better achieve their objectives.

Now, considering that Hidden Cobra is already targeting financial organizations and has developed Bankshot implants for espionage, it's logical that they would want to enhance these implants to have more control and destructive capabilities.

Full control over victim systems would allow them to manipulate data, install additional malware, or use the systems for further attacks. Wiping files could be used as a destructive measure, perhaps to cover their tracks or cause disruption.

Given that Hidden Cobra is linked to a nation-state, it's possible that their objectives could include not just espionage but also disruption or destruction, depending on the political context.

Therefore, it's plausible that they would develop such capabilities.

Looking back at the question, it says: "is it likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development?"

Given the analysis above, it seems likely that they would develop such capabilities as part of their ongoing efforts to improve their tools and tactics.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

Wait, but the question is about whether they will develop these capabilities under the tactic of Resource Development. Given that Resource Development encompasses activities related to improving their tools and resources, developing enhanced implants aligns with this tactic.

Therefore, yes, it is likely.

So, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
