So I've got this question here about some cyber stuff, and I need to figure out the right answer based on what's being asked. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions APT3 exploiting a zero-day vulnerability through phishing emails to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor. Then it talks about GH0ST RAT being delivered by APT18's phishing campaign and communicating with an APT18 CnC address. The main question is whether it's likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses, given all this information.

Okay, so I need to understand what SHOTPUT is and how it typically operates. From what I know, SHOTPUT is a backdoor used by APT3, which is also known as Bronze Sparrow or MenuPass. It's a piece of malware that allows attackers to control an infected system remotely.

Now, the question is about whether SHOTPUT communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses. Hardcoded CnC addresses mean that the addresses to which the malware communicates are embedded directly into the malware's code. This is a common technique, but it also has drawbacks because if those addresses are discovered, the entire command and control infrastructure can be compromised.

On the other hand, the question mentions GH0ST RAT, which is another type of malware, delivered by APT18. APT18 is a different group, also known as OceanLotus or Vietnam-based attackers. GH0ST RAT is likely another backdoor tool used by this group.

The question seems to be setting up a scenario where APT3 uses SHOTPUT via a zero-day exploit from the Hacking Team leak, and APT18 uses GH0ST RAT via phishing. Then it asks about the likelihood of SHOTPUT using hardcoded CnC addresses, while GH0ST RAT calls back to an APT18 CnC address.

I think the key here is to understand the typical behavior of SHOTPUT and whether it uses hardcoded CnC addresses. Also, the mention of GH0ST RAT and APT18 seems to be providing additional context, but I need to focus on SHOTPUT and APT3.

From my knowledge, many malware samples, including backdoors, do contain hardcoded CnC addresses. This is a standard method for maintaining control over compromised systems. However, advanced groups might use more sophisticated methods to make their CnC communications harder to detect and disrupt.

APT3, being an advanced persistent threat group, might employ various techniques to hide their CnC communications, such as using domain generation algorithms (DGAs), fast-flux networks, or even embedding CnC servers within legitimate services.

But specifically for SHOTPUT, I need to recall or find information on how its CnC communications are handled. Unfortunately, without access to specific threat reports or malware analyses, I have to rely on general knowledge.

Given that, it's plausible that SHOTPUT uses hardcoded CnC addresses, especially if it's a backdoor developed by APT3. However, APT groups are known to evolve their tactics and may use more advanced methods to avoid detection.

The question also mentions that GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18, calls out to an APT18 CnC address. This suggests that GH0ST RAT, which is likely a different piece of malware, has its own CnC infrastructure managed by APT18.

So, the question is essentially asking whether it's likely that SHOTPUT, used by APT3, will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses, considering that GH0ST RAT, used by APT18, communicates with an APT18 CnC address.

I think the comparison here is to highlight that different APT groups use different tools and techniques, and their malware may have different methods for CnC communications.

Given that, I need to decide whether it's likely or not that SHOTPUT uses hardcoded CnC addresses. Since many backdoors do use hardcoded addresses, and without specific information suggesting otherwise, I would lean towards saying yes, it's likely.

However, the answer choices are just "Yes" and "No," which are quite straightforward.

Considering all this, I think the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A}} \]
