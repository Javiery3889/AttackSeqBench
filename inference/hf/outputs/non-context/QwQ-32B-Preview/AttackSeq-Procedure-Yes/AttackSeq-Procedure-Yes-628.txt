To answer this question, let's break down the scenario and analyze the behavior of the malware step by step.

First, the malware executes by rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension. This action suggests that the malware is attempting to hide its presence by placing itself in a location where temporary files are stored, which is a common practice for malware to blend in with legitimate system files.

Using a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension is a tactic to make the file less conspicuous and more difficult to identify through manual inspection or automated scans. This is because security tools and analysts often look for files with specific names or extensions that are known to be associated with malware. By using a random name and a common extension, the malware reduces the likelihood of being detected based on its filename alone.

Now, considering the question: "Is it likely that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection?"

Given that the malware has already taken steps to hide its presence by storing itself in the %Temp% folder with a randomized name, it is reasonable to infer that it is designed with evasion in mind. Malware that goes to the trouble of disguising its filename and location is likely to employ additional evasion and obfuscation techniques to further protect itself from detection.

Evasion techniques can include a variety of methods such as:

1. **Code Obfuscation:** Encrypting or encoding parts of the malware's code to make it harder for security tools to analyze.

2. **Process Injection:** Injecting its code into legitimate processes to hide its execution.

3. **Rootkit Techniques:** Hiding its presence by modifying system data or processes.

4. **Avoiding Debuggers and Sandboxes:** Detecting when it is being analyzed and altering its behavior accordingly.

5. **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs):** Generating a large number of domain names for command and control servers to make takedown efforts more difficult.

Obfuscation is a key component of these evasion techniques, as it makes the malware's code and activities more difficult to understand and trace.

Therefore, based on the initial behavior of the malware, it is likely that it will employ further evasion techniques and obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A**
