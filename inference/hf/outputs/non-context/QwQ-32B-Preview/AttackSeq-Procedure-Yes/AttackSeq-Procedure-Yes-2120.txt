To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned and determine if the sequence described is plausible based on known attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the sequence of events mentioned in the question:

1. **Executing fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader**: This is a method of executing malicious code without writing it to disk, often by leveraging legitimate system processes. DLL side-loading involves placing a malicious DLL in a directory where an application will load it instead of the intended legitimate DLL.

2. **Performing software discovery using WMIC**: WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is a command-line utility that allows system information and changes to be made to a computer running Windows. Attackers might use WMIC to gather information about the system, such as installed software, running processes, and system configurations.

3. **Heavily utilizing RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for lateral movement to target additional servers**: RDP is a protocol that allows users to connect to another computer over a network. Attackers can use RDP to move laterally within a network, accessing and compromising additional systems.

Now, I need to evaluate whether this sequence is likely based on known A41APT attacker behaviors and general attack patterns.

**Step 1: Understanding A41APT**

A41APT is a less commonly known threat group, and specific details about their TTPs might not be widely documented. However, many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups follow similar patterns in their attacks, so I can make some general assumptions based on typical APT behavior.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence**

- **Initial Compromise**: The use of fileless implants via DLL side-loading with DESLoader suggests a sophisticated initial compromise. Fileless attacks are stealthy and can evade traditional antivirus solutions.

- **Discovery Phase**: After gaining initial access, attackers typically perform reconnaissance to understand the target environment. Using WMIC for software discovery is a plausible step in this phase, as it helps attackers identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.

- **Lateral Movement**: Once the attackers have gathered sufficient information, they may move laterally within the network to access more critical systems. Using RDP for lateral movement is common, as it is a built-in Windows feature and often allowed between internal systems.

**Step 3: Evaluating Plausibility**

Given that each step in the sequence aligns with typical APT attack patterns, it is plausible that after executing fileless implants via DLL side-loading, attackers would perform software discovery using WMIC before utilizing RDP for lateral movement.

**Step 4: Considering Alternatives**

While this sequence makes sense, it's essential to consider if there are any reasons why this sequence might not be likely. For instance, some attackers might prefer different tools or techniques for discovery or lateral movement. However, without specific information indicating otherwise, the sequence appears reasonable.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, it is likely that after executing fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader, A41APT attackers will perform software discovery using WMIC before heavily utilizing RDP for lateral movement to target additional servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
