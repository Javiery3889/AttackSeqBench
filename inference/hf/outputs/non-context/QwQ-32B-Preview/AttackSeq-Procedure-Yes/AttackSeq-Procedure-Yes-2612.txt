To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the context provided in the question. It mentions that attackers have used mobile applications containing spyware to collect sensitive information such as contact lists and geo-location data from victims during what's referred to as the "Collection phase." Now, the question is asking whether it's likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive this stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the "Command and Control" (C2) phase.

Let's clarify some terms to make sure we're on the same page.

1. **Spyware**: This is a type of malware that is designed to collect information from a person's device without their knowledge. It can capture a variety of data, including keystrokes, screenshots, emails, and, in this case, contact lists and geo-location data.

2. **Collection phase**: In the context of cyber attacks, this refers to the stage where the malware gathers the desired information from the target's device.

3. **Command and Control (C2) phase**: This is the stage where the malware communicates with the attackers' servers to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate the collected data.

Now, the question is specifically asking about the method by which the stolen data is transmitted from the compromised devices to the attackers' infrastructure during the C2 phase.

The answer choices are straightforward: A) Yes, it is likely that the data will be transmitted over an application layer protocol; or B) No, it is not likely.

To make an informed decision, we need to consider how malware typically communicates with its C2 servers.

**Application Layer Protocols**

In the context of the internet, the application layer is the seventh layer of the OSI model and includes protocols that are used for high-level communications between processes running on different stations on a network. Common application layer protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, and many others.

Malware authors often prefer to use application layer protocols for C2 communications because these protocols are usually allowed through firewalls and are less likely to arouse suspicion. For example, using HTTPS not only encrypts the data, making it harder to inspect, but it also blends in with normal web traffic.

**Mobile Applications and Data Exfiltration**

Mobile devices, especially those with operating systems like Android and iOS, have various mechanisms in place to control what data apps can access and how they can communicate over the network. However, if an app is malicious and has been granted the necessary permissions, it can collect sensitive data and transmit it back to the attackers.

Given that the spyware is already on the device and has managed to collect sensitive information like contact lists and geo-location data, it's logical to assume that it would need to send this data back to the attackers. The most straightforward way to do this is through the network, using an application layer protocol.

**Likelihood of Using Application Layer Protocols**

Considering the above points, it's highly likely that the malware would use an application layer protocol for C2 communications. Here's why:

- **Stealth**: Application layer protocols are commonly used and allowed, making it easier for malicious traffic to go unnoticed.

- **Encryption**: Protocols like HTTPS provide encryption, which can hide the content of the communications from network monitoring tools.

- **Simplicity**: Implementing C2 communications using standard protocols is easier for malware authors, as these protocols are well-documented and have widespread support.

- **Compatibility**: Most networks allow traffic on ports used by these protocols, reducing the chance of communications being blocked.

Therefore, given the benefits and the common practices in malware design, it's reasonable to conclude that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the C2 phase.

**Final Answer**

A: Yes
