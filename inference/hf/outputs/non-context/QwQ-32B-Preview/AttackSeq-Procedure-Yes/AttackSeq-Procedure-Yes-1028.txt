To answer this question, I need to consider the typical behavior of the Gamaredon group and whether deploying scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents aligns with their known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

First, I should recall who the Gamaredon group is. Gamaredon is a cyber threat group that has been active since at least 2012. They are known for their targeted attacks, often involving social engineering and the use of malware to gain access to victims' systems. Their targets have included government entities, think tanks, and other organizations of interest.

Now, the question mentions that Gamaredon uses an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets. This seems consistent with their known modus operandi, as they have been observed using phishing emails with malicious attachments to infect systems.

The question then asks whether, after achieving lateral movement, it is likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

To answer this, I need to think about what objectives the Gamaredon group typically has in their operations. Generally, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Gamaredon aim to maintain persistent access to target networks and exfiltrate sensitive information over time. Therefore, once they have gained access to a system, they would likely seek to gather as much valuable data as possible.

Deploying scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents would be an efficient way to achieve this goal. Such scripts could be programmed to search for files with specific extensions, keywords, or metadata that indicate sensitivity, such as documents containing classified information, intellectual property, or personal data.

Moreover, using automated scripts for data collection reduces the manual effort required by the attackers and allows them to cover more ground quickly. This is particularly important for APT groups that may need to operate undetected for extended periods.

Considering the above points, it seems plausible that the Gamaredon group would deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents after gaining access through lateral movement.

However, I should also consider whether there is any specific information or indicators associated with the Gamaredon group that either supports or contradicts this assumption.

Upon reviewing available resources, I find that Gamaredon has been known to use a variety of tools and techniques to carry out their operations, including custom malware and living-off-the-land binaries. While specific details about their data collection methods may not be extensively documented, their overall objective of collecting sensitive information suggests that they would employ efficient means to achieve this, which could include automated scripts.

Additionally, it's worth noting that many APT groups use custom scripts and tools tailored to the specific environment they are operating in. Therefore, it would not be surprising if Gamaredon employed such scripts for data discovery and exfiltration.

In conclusion, based on the typical objectives and behaviors of the Gamaredon group, as well as the general practices of APT groups, it is likely that they would deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities after lateral movement.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
