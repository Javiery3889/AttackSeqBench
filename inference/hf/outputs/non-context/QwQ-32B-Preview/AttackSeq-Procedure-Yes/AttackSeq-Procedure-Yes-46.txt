To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine whether it's likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

First, let's break down the components of the question:

1. **Phishing Emails**: These are typically used to trick users into opening attachments or clicking on links that can lead to malware infection.

2. **Malicious Attachment**: In this case, it's a Microsoft Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. Word documents can contain macros, which are small programs that can automate tasks but can also be used maliciously.

3. **VBS Macros**: VBS stands for Visual Basic Script. Macros in Word documents can be written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), which is similar to VBS. These macros can execute scripts that perform various actions, including downloading and executing malware.

Now, considering the sequence:

- The attack starts with phishing emails containing the malicious Word document.

- If the recipient opens the document and enables macros (if prompted), the VBS macros inside could execute.

The question is asking whether it's likely that this sequence will occur based on the observed campaign.

To evaluate this, I need to consider a few factors:

- **User Behavior**: Users need to open the email, download the attachment, and enable macros for the attack to succeed. Modern Office applications often block macros by default, which can prevent execution unless the user enables them.

- **Campaign Tactics**: Different phishing campaigns have different levels of sophistication. Some may use social engineering techniques to convince users to enable macros, while others might rely on vulnerabilities in the software to execute without user interaction.

Given that the question mentions "observed campaign," it suggests that there is some evidence or intelligence about how this particular campaign operates. However, without specific details about the campaign's tactics, I have to make some general assumptions.

In many phishing campaigns involving malicious Word documents, the goal is indeed to get the user to enable macros so that the embedded VBS scripts can run and download malware or perform other malicious actions.

Therefore, based on general knowledge of such attacks, it is likely that the campaign aims to execute VBS macros from the embedded Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the analysis above, the most plausible answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
