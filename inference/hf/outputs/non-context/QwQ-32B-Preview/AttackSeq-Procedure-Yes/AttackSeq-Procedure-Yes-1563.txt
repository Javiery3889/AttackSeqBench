So I've got this question here about the SolarWinds attack and the Sunburst backdoor. It's asking whether, after the initial access through the supply-chain attack, it's likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its command and control (C2) server using a protocol for further exploitation. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what happened in the SolarWinds attack. So, SolarWinds is a company that provides network management and monitoring software. They have this product called Orion, which is widely used by enterprises and government agencies. In this attack, the hackers compromised the SolarWinds software update mechanism and inserted a backdoor into the Orion software. This backdoor is known as Sunburst.

So, the initial access was through a supply-chain attack, meaning that the attackers tainted the software update before it was distributed to thousands of organizations that use SolarWinds Orion. Once the tainted update was installed, the Sunburst backdoor was planted on those organizations' networks.

Now, the question is asking about what happens after this initial access. Specifically, whether it's likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

To answer this, I need to think about how backdoors typically work. A backdoor is a piece of malware that allows attackers to gain access to a system without the owner's knowledge. Once installed, it usually establishes communication with a C2 server to receive commands or download additional malware.

In the case of Sunburst, it's designed to be stealthy and maintain long-term access to the compromised networks. It's known that Sunburst has the capability to communicate with C2 servers to receive instructions and exfiltrate data.

So, considering that, it's highly likely that after gaining initial access through the supply-chain attack, the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server to carry out further exploitation activities. This could include downloading additional tools, moving laterally within the network, gathering sensitive information, and so on.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

But let me double-check this. Maybe there's a twist here that I'm missing. The question specifies "for further exploitation." Well, communicating with a C2 server is indeed a step in the exploitation process. It's part of the attacker's lifecycle where they establish a foothold and then expand their access within the network.

Looking back at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors, this would fall under the "Command and Control" technique, which is a part of the post-exploitation phase.

So, yes, after initial access, the next logical step is for the backdoor to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions or download additional payloads.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
