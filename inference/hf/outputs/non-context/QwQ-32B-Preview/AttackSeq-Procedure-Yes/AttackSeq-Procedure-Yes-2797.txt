To answer this question, I need to consider whether Grandoreiro, a known malware or threat actor, is likely to use techniques for stealing credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after gathering specific information about the target system. The information collected includes the computer's name, username, and details about installed banking protection software.

First, I should understand who or what Grandoreiro is. A quick search indicates that Grandoreiro is a banking trojan that targets users of Brazilian banks. It is known for its ability to bypass security measures and steal sensitive information.

Given that it's a banking trojan, its primary objective is to steal banking credentials and other sensitive financial information from victims. Therefore, it would make sense for it to target credentials stored in web browsers like Google Chrome and email clients like Microsoft Outlook, as these are common places where users store login credentials.

Now, considering the information it collects:

1. Computer's name: This could be useful for identifying the target system within a network or for organizing stolen data.

2. Username: Knowing the username can help in targeting specific individuals or understanding the access level of the compromised account.

3. Installed banking protection software: This is crucial for the malware to determine whether there are security measures in place that it needs to bypass or disable to successfully steal credentials.

Given this context, it's logical to assume that after collecting this information, Grandoreiro would proceed to steal credentials from Chrome and Outlook, as these are direct sources of potential banking login information.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes," it is probable that Grandoreiro will employ techniques to steal credentials from these applications after gathering the initial information.

**Final Answer: A**
