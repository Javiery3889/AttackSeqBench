To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand what AtomBombing is. AtomBombing is a technique that abuse the atom tables in Windows to inject code into other processes. Atom tables are global tables that store strings and are accessible across different processes. By manipulating these tables, attackers can inject malicious code into trusted processes, which can then execute the code with the privileges of that process.

Now, the question is asking whether, after using this technique to execute malicious code, threat actors are likely to use this capability to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

Let's look at the two possible answers:

A: Yes

B: No

We need to decide which one is more plausible.

First, consider what AtomBombing achieves. By using atom tables, attackers can inject code into other processes. This means they can execute their malicious code within the context of a trusted process. This has two main benefits for the attackers:

1. **Bypassing process-level restrictions:** If certain processes have restrictions or are more privileged, running malicious code within those processes can help the attackers circumvent those restrictions.

2. **Evading security products:** Security products often monitor processes for suspicious activities. If the malicious code is running within a trusted process, it might be less likely to be detected because the process is expected to be running and performing certain actions.

Given these points, it seems logical that threat actors would want to use this capability to their advantage.

Moreover, this technique has been documented and used in real-world attacks. For example, the AtomBombing technique was discovered and detailed by researchers, and it has been used by malware to inject code into processes like explorer.exe, which is a trusted system process.

Additionally, many security products are designed to detect anomalies in process behavior. By injecting code into trusted processes, attackers can mask their activities behind legitimate process activities, making it harder for security software to flag the malicious actions as abnormal.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that threat actors are likely to use AtomBombing to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

So, the answer should be:

**Final Answer: A**
