To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the persistence methods mentioned are likely given the initial access vector.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial Access**: FamousSparrow exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities to gain initial access by dropping and executing SparrowDoor through cmd.exe.

2. **Persistence**: The question suggests that they achieved persistence by creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex.

I need to evaluate whether these persistence techniques are plausible following the initial access method described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Initial Access via Remote Code Execution

- **Technique**: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities to drop and execute SparrowDoor through cmd.exe.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**:
  - **T1059.003**: Command and Scripting Interpreter: cmd.exe
  - **T1203**: Exploitation for Client Execution
  - **T1204**: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

This indicates that the threat actor has successfully executed code on the target system using cmd.exe, likely leading to a foothold on the system.

#### 2. Persistence Methods

The persistence methods mentioned are:

- **Creating a registry Run key entry**

- **Installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex**

I need to evaluate the plausibility of these methods following the initial access.

##### a. Creating a Registry Run Key Entry

- **Technique**: Adding a registry key to the Run registry key to achieve persistence.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1060.01 Create or Modify System Process: Modify Registry

This is a common persistence mechanism. After gaining initial access, threat actors often create registry Run keys to ensure their malware executes during system startup.

##### b. Installing SparrowDoor as a Service

- **Technique**: Installing malware as a Windows service to achieve persistence.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: T1050.005 Service Execution: Service Binary Path Modification

Installing a service is another standard persistence method. By creating a service, the malware can be started automatically at system boot and run with system privileges.

#### 3. Plausibility of Persistence Methods

Given that the initial access was achieved through remote code execution via cmd.exe, it is highly plausible that the threat actor would implement persistence mechanisms such as creating registry Run keys and installing services.

These methods are standard in the threat actor toolkit and are effective for maintaining access to the compromised system.

#### 4. Specifics of the Persistence Methods

- **Registry Run Key Entry**: This is straightforward and often one of the first steps in establishing persistence.

- **Service Installation**: Naming the service "WSearchIndex" might be an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate Windows service, as many services have names related to system functions.

This naming convention could be an effort to blend in with legitimate system processes, making detection more difficult.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, it is likely that FamousSparrow achieved persistence by creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex following the initial access via remote code execution vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
