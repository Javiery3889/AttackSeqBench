To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the proposed lateral movement activity aligns with the initial discovery phase actions.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Threat Group (TG) 1021** has used **SharpHound** and **PowerSploit** tools.

   - **SharpHound** is a tool used for Active Directory (AD) reconnaissance. It collects information about AD objects and their relationships, which can be used to map the environment and identify potential paths for lateral movement.

   - **PowerSploit** is a collection of PowerShell scripts and modules for penetration testing. It includes various modules for reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities.

2. These tools were loaded directly into the memory of infected machines, indicating that the threat actor is trying to minimize disk footprint and evade detection.

3. The output files from these tools were gathered during the Discovery phase.

4. The question is whether, during the Lateral Movement phase, TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the **NodeIISWeb** web shell loader to compromise additional servers.

Now, let's evaluate the plausibility of this sequence.

### Analysis

**Discovery Phase:**

- **SharpHound** and **PowerSploit** are both powerful tools for gathering information about the target environment.

- **SharpHound** helps in understanding the AD structure, which is crucial for identifying high-value targets and potential lateral movement paths.

- **PowerSploit** can be used for various reconnaissance tasks, such as enumerating system information, user accounts, shares, and more.

- By loading these tools directly into memory, the threat actor is attempting to avoid leaving artifacts on disk that could be detected by security solutions.

**Lateral Movement Phase:**

- The proposed action is to access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the **NodeIISWeb** web shell loader.

- **SMB** (Server Message Block) is a protocol commonly used for sharing files and printers in Windows environments. Gaining access to shared folders can provide threat actors with additional resources and potential entry points to other systems.

- **NodeIISWeb** is a web shell, which is a script that can be uploaded to a web server to provide remote access and control. Web shells are often used for maintaining persistent access and executing commands on the server.

### Evaluation

Given the initial actions in the Discovery phase, it is plausible that TG1021 would proceed to the Lateral Movement phase by accessing shared folders over SMB and dropping a web shell like **NodeIISWeb**. Here's why:

1. **Information Gathered During Discovery:**

   - The output from **SharpHound** and **PowerSploit** would provide detailed information about the network, including server names, shares, and potential vulnerabilities.

   - This information can be used to identify which servers have shared folders that can be accessed, and which servers run web services that can be compromised with a web shell.

2. **Lateral Movement via SMB:**

   - SMB is a common protocol in Windows environments, and many internal servers use it for file sharing.

   - If the threat actor has obtained credentials or gained privileges during the Discovery phase, they can use these to access shared folders on other servers.

3. **Dropping a Web Shell:**

   - Once access is gained to a web server, dropping a web shell like **NodeIISWeb** allows the threat actor to maintain persistent access and execute commands on the server.

   - Web shells are particularly dangerous because they can be hidden within legitimate web content and are often difficult to detect.

### Conclusion

Based on the sequence of TTPs described, it is likely that TG1021 would engage in the lateral movement activities outlined. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
