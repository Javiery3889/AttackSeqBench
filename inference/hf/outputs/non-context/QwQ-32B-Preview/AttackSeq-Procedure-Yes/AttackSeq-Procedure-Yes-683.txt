To answer this question, I need to consider the behavior of Stuxnet, particularly in relation to its communication with command and control (C&C) servers after exploiting specific vulnerabilities for lateral movement.

First, some background on Stuxnet: Stuxnet is a sophisticated malware discovered in 2010 that was designed to target Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, particularly those used in Iranian nuclear facilities. It is known for its complexity and the use of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to propagate and execute its payload.

The question mentions the exploitation of MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement. MS08-067 is a vulnerability in the Windows Server service, which Stuxnet used for initial propagation and lateral movement. MS10-061 is a vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service, which was also exploited by Stuxnet for similar purposes.

Now, regarding communication with C&C servers, Stuxnet is known to have used a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture for command and control, which allowed infected machines to communicate with each other and exchange commands and updates without relying on a central server. This P2P mechanism was likely designed to make the C&C infrastructure more resilient to takedown attempts.

In terms of encryption, Stuxnet did employ encryption for some of its communications. For instance, it used encrypted configuration data and employed encryption for some of its command and control communications to hide the data being transmitted and to avoid detection by network security measures.

Given this information, it is plausible that after exploiting the mentioned vulnerabilities for lateral movement, Stuxnet would communicate with its C&C servers using encrypted channels to send system information and receive commands or updates. This aligns with its overall design to remain stealthy and avoid detection.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
