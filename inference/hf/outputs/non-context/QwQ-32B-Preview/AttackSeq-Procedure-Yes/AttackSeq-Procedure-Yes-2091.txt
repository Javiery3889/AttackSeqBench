To answer this question, I need to consider the typical behavior of attackers who have gained access to an organization's network and obtained administrative-level credentials. The question describes a scenario where attackers have used the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and have collected high-level credentials. Based on this information, I need to determine whether it is likely that they will proceed to move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising multiple workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

First, let's understand the context:

1. **Cobalt Strike Beacon**: This is a powerful tool used by red teams and attackers for post-exploitation tasks. It allows for remote control of compromised systems and can be used to gather information about the network, including mapping the internal structure.

2. **Administrative-Level Credentials**: These are high-privilege credentials that provide broad access to systems and resources within the network. Having such credentials significantly enhances an attacker's ability to move laterally and gain deeper access to sensitive areas.

Given these factors, let's consider the likely actions of the attackers:

- **Network Mapping**: With the Cobalt Strike beacon, attackers can discover the network topology, identify key systems, and determine potential paths for lateral movement.

- **Credential Harvesting**: Collecting administrative credentials allows attackers to bypass security controls and access systems that would otherwise be protected.

Now, considering the goal of most cyberattacks is to achieve their objective, which could be data exfiltration, disruption, ransomware deployment, etc., moving laterally across the network is a common tactic to reach their target.

Here’s why lateral movement is likely in this scenario:

1. **Access to High-Value Targets**: Administrative credentials can provide direct access to critical systems and data stores. Moving laterally allows attackers to reach these high-value targets.

2. **Persistence and Evasion**: By compromising multiple systems, attackers can ensure persistence in the network and evade detection by security measures.

3. **Data Aggregation**: In many cases, data of interest is分散在不同的系统上。横向移动使攻击者能够从多个系统收集数据，然后集中处理或外泄。

4. **Privilege Escalation**: Even with administrative credentials, attackers might seek higher levels of access or different types of credentials that could be useful for their objectives.

Given these points, it is highly likely that attackers in this position would engage in lateral movement to further their goals.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
