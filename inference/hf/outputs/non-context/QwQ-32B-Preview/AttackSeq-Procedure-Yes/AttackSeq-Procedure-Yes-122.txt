I've got this question here about some cyber threat group called Agrius. It seems like they're using some specific tactics to break into systems and move around within a network. The question is a bit technical, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Agrius is exploiting public-facing applications to gain initial access through vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-13379. I need to understand what that means. So, CVE-2018-13379 is a specific vulnerability identifier. A quick search tells me that this CVE is related to Oracle WebLogic Server, which is a platform for building and deploying enterprise applications. This vulnerability likely allows attackers to execute code remotely, which is pretty severe.

So, Agrius is using this vulnerability to get into systems. That makes sense as a starting point. Once they're in, the question says they might use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic. A webshell is a piece of code that attackers upload to a web server to maintain access and control over the server. RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, which is a Microsoft protocol that allows users to connect to another computer over a network.

Tunneling RDP traffic through a webshell suggests that Agrius is finding a way to use the webshell to create a connection that can forward RDP traffic. This might be a way to bypass firewalls or other network restrictions. It sounds plausible, especially if they want to control systems internally.

Next, the question mentions that Agrius is likely to leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement. Lateral movement is when attackers move within a network from one system to another, often to access more sensitive data or systems. Using compromised accounts makes sense because it allows them to move around without drawing attention, as they're using legitimate credentials.

Finally, the question says Agrius communicates with command and control (C2) servers using something called the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP. I need to look into what that is. IPsec is Internet Protocol Security, which is a protocol used to secure IP communications. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor might be a tool that Agrius uses to disguise their communications as legitimate IPsec traffic, but in reality, it's sending data to their C2 servers over HTTP.

Using HTTP for C2 communications is common because HTTP traffic is usually allowed through firewalls, making it harder to detect malicious activity. Disguising it as IPsec might add an extra layer of evasion.

Now, looking at the answer choices: A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on what I've read, it seems like Agrius is employing a series of tactics that are quite methodical and targeted. They're exploiting a known vulnerability to get in, using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for internal control, moving laterally using compromised accounts, and communicating with their C2 servers using a backdoor that masquerades as IPsec but uses HTTP.

Each of these steps seems logical in the context of a targeted attack. Starting with gaining initial access, establishing a foothold, moving inside the network, and maintaining communication with their command servers. It all adds up.

Therefore, I think the answer is A: Yes, this sequence of tactics is likely for Agrius based on the description provided.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
