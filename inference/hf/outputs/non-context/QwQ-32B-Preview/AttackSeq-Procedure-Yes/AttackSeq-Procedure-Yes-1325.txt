So I've got this question here about CosmicDuke, which I believe is a type of malware or a threat actor. The question is a bit technical, but I'll try to break it down step by step. It says that after searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types in the discovery phase, is it likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP?

First, I need to understand what each part of this means. The "discovery phase" likely refers to the initial stage where the malware is trying to find valuable information on the target system. Searching removable drives makes sense because people often store important files on USBs or external hard drives. Skipping certain file types might mean that the malware is targeting specific file extensions that are more likely to contain sensitive information, like documents or spreadsheets, and ignoring others like media files.

Now, the question is whether, after this discovery phase, CosmicDuke would use a clipboard stealer. A clipboard stealer is a type of malware that monitors the clipboard for copied data and can exfiltrate that data. Clipboard data can include passwords, URLs, text snippets, and more, so it's a potential source of sensitive information.

The final part is about exfiltrating the collected information via FTP, which is a common protocol for transferring files over the internet.

So, the question is essentially asking if, after searching for files on removable drives and skipping some file types, CosmicDuke would then use a clipboard stealer to collect additional data and send all this data to remote servers using FTP.

Looking at the answer choices, it's a simple yes or no question.

To answer this, I need to think about the typical behavior of malware like CosmicDuke. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of CosmicDuke, but generally, advanced malware uses multiple techniques to gather as much information as possible from a compromised system.

So, if it's already searching for files on removable drives, it might also employ other data collection methods, like using a clipboard stealer, to maximize the amount of sensitive data it can exfiltrate.

However, I need to consider whether using a clipboard stealer makes sense in this context. Searching for files on removable drives is a proactive way to find stored data, while a clipboard stealer is more opportunistic, capturing data as it's being copied and pasted in real-time. These are different approaches to data exfiltration.

Moreover, exfiltrating data via FTP is a common method, but modern malware often uses more sophisticated and stealthier methods to avoid detection.

Given that, it's possible that CosmicDuke could use a clipboard stealer in addition to searching for files, but it's not necessarily likely unless there's specific evidence or known behavior of CosmicDuke that suggests it uses such techniques.

Since I don't have specific information about CosmicDuke's capabilities or known tactics, I'll have to make an educated guess based on general malware behavior.

Many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and malware families do use a combination of techniques to gather information. Using both file searches and clipboard stealers could be part of a multi-pronged approach to ensure they collect as much sensitive data as possible.

Therefore, it seems plausible that CosmicDuke could use a clipboard stealer in addition to searching for files on removable drives.

So, my answer would be "Yes," it is likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
