To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events and analyze whether the described method aligns with typical malware infection processes, particularly those involving batch files and UAC bypass.

First, the question describes a scenario where a base64-encoded CAB file is downloaded from a remote site via a script embedded in a malicious document. This is a common initial infection vector where an attacker tricks a user into opening a document that contains malicious code.

Next, the question asks whether it's likely that the malware infection method will use batch files in a multi-step process before employing a UAC (User Account Control) bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges.

Let's consider each part of this sequence:

1. **Use of Batch Files**: Batch files are a common tool in Windows environments for automating tasks. Malware authors might use batch files as part of their infection chain because they are easy to create and can perform a variety of actions, such as copying files, creating registry entries, or executing other scripts.

2. **Multi-Step Process**: Malware infections often involve multiple steps to evade detection and to establish a persistent presence on the target system. Each step can be designed to perform a specific task, such as downloading additional payloads, modifying system settings, or creating backdoors.

3. **UAC Bypass Module**: UAC is a security feature in Windows that restricts applications from making changes to the system without user consent. Malware often includes UAC bypass techniques to gain elevated privileges without alerting the user.

Given this context, it is plausible that malware would use batch files in a multi-step process leading up to a UAC bypass to execute the main payload with elevated privileges. Here's why:

- **Flexibility**: Batch files offer flexibility in automating tasks and can be easily modified or replaced if needed.

- **Stealth**: By breaking the infection process into multiple steps, malware can reduce its footprint at any single point, making it harder to detect.

- **Elevation of Privileges**: Using a UAC bypass module is a common technique to gain higher privileges necessary for more impactful system modifications.

However, it's important to note that malware infection methods vary widely, and not all malware will follow this exact sequence. Some malware might use different techniques for persistence, privilege escalation, or execution, depending on the attacker's goals and the target environment.

In the context of the question, where a base64-encoded CAB file is downloaded and presumably executed, it's reasonable to assume that the infection process might involve batch files and a UAC bypass, especially if the goal is to achieve elevated privileges silently.

Therefore, considering the likelihood based on common malware behaviors and the steps described, the answer is likely "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
