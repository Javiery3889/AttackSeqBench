To answer this question, I need to consider whether FIN13, a known cyber threat group, is likely to use specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in their operations, particularly focusing on reconnaissance and credential acquisition.

First, I need to understand who FIN13 is. FIN13 is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for its cyber espionage activities. They are believed to be state-sponsored and have been active since at least 2012. Their primary targets include government entities, think tanks, and organizations in various industries such as energy, finance, and technology.

Next, I need to consider the TTPs mentioned in the question:

1. **Gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.**

2. **Dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations.**

I need to evaluate whether these actions align with FIN13's known modus operandi.

**Step 1: Researching FIN13's TTPs**

I should look into available cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand FIN13's typical behaviors.

- **CTI Reports:** Various security firms and intelligence agencies publish reports on APT groups like FIN13. These reports often detail the TTPs used by these groups.

- **MITRE ATT&CK:** This is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It categorizes different attack techniques and links them to specific threat groups.

**Step 2: Analyzing the TTPs**

- **Reconnaissance using native OS binaries:** This technique involves using built-in operating system tools to gather information about the target environment. Examples include commands like `netstat`, `tasklist`, `systeminfo`, etc. Using native binaries reduces the risk of detection since no additional malware is introduced.

- **Dumping LSASS process memory:** LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is a process in Windows operating systems that handles user authentication. Dumping its memory can yield plaintext credentials, hashes, and other sensitive information, which attackers can use to move laterally within the network.

**Step 3: Cross-referencing with FIN13's known activities**

I need to see if FIN13 has been observed using these techniques in the past.

- **Reconnaissance:** Many APT groups, including those with nation-state affiliations, prefer to use native OS binaries for initial reconnaissance to avoid detection by security software. This is a stealthy approach that blends in with normal system administration activities.

- **Credential dumping:** LSASS dumping is a common technique used by various APT groups to obtain credentials for lateral movement within a compromised network. It is an effective way to gain access to other systems and maintain persistence.

**Step 4: Evaluating the likelihood**

Given that FIN13 is an advanced threat group with a history of cyber espionage, it is plausible that they would employ sophisticated and stealthy techniques like using native OS binaries for reconnaissance and dumping LSASS for credentials. These techniques align with the need for stealth and efficiency in their operations.

**Step 5: Considering alternative answer choices**

Option A is "Yes," suggesting that it is likely FIN13 will use these TTPs. Option B is "No," indicating it is unlikely.

Given the analysis above, Option A seems more plausible because these TTPs are consistent with the behaviors of advanced persistent threat groups, including those with state-sponsored backgrounds.

**Final Answer: A**
