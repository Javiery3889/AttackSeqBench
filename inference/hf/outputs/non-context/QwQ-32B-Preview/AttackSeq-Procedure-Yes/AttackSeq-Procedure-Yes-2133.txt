To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Konni APT group, specifically focusing on how they collect and exfiltrate information from a target's computer.

First, let's break down the components mentioned in the question:

1. **versioninfo.bat**: This is likely a batch script used to collect version information about the target's system. Such scripts can gather details about the operating system, installed software, and hardware configurations, which are valuable for an attacker to identify vulnerabilities and plan further steps in the attack.

2. **unactivate.vbs**: This appears to be a Visual Basic Script (VBS) that might be involved in some form of system manipulation or data handling. The name "unactivate" could suggest that it's related to disabling security features or activating certain modules, but without specific knowledge, it's speculative.

3. **Exfiltration via POST request**: This refers to the method used by the attackers to send the collected data out of the target's network. Using HTTP POST requests is a common technique because it allows for sending data in the request body, which can be less conspicuous than other methods.

Now, considering the sequence: collect information with 'versioninfo.bat', process it with 'unactivate.vbs', and then exfiltrate it via a POST request.

To determine if this sequence is plausible, I need to consider how APT groups, particularly the Konni group, typically operate.

**Research on Konni APT Group:**

The Konni APT group is known for its use of malware that targets various sectors, including government, military, and think tanks. Their tactics often involve spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links that, when opened, download and execute malware on the target's system.

Once the malware is executed, it can perform a variety of actions, including information gathering, persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.

**Information Gathering:**

It's common for APT groups to collect system information to understand the environment they've infiltrated. This helps them tailor their attacks to exploit known vulnerabilities or to avoid detection by security measures.

**Data Processing:**

Before exfiltrating data, attackers might process it to compress, encrypt, or otherwise manipulate it to make the exfiltration more efficient or to evade detection by network security tools.

**Data Exfiltration:**

Exfiltration is a critical step where the collected data is sent out of the target's network. APT groups often use encryption and common protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to blend in with normal traffic and avoid raising alarms.

**Analyzing the Sequence:**

Given the above, the sequence described—collecting information with 'versioninfo.bat', processing it with 'unactivate.vbs', and then exfiltrating it via a POST request—seems plausible.

- **Step 1: Information Collection** ('versioninfo.bat'): This aligns with the initial phase of gathering system information.

- **Step 2: Data Processing** ('unactivate.vbs'): This could be a step where the collected data is prepared for exfiltration, perhaps by encoding, compressing, or encrypting it.

- **Step 3: Exfiltration** (POST request): This is a standard method for sending data out, especially when trying to mimic normal web traffic.

However, without specific details about how 'unactivate.vbs' functions, it's essential to consider alternative possibilities. For instance, 'unactivate.vbs' might not be directly involved in data processing or exfiltration but could serve another purpose, such as disabling system utilities or modifying registry settings to maintain persistence.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the typical behaviors of APT groups and the plausibility of the sequence described, it is likely that the Konni APT group would send the collected data through 'unactivate.vbs' before exfiltrating it via a POST request. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
