To answer this question, we need to analyze the behavior of the Korplug malware and determine if it is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.

First, let's understand what Korplug malware is. Korplug is a type of malware that targets industrial control systems (ICS) and is known for its ability to maintain persistence on infected systems and exfiltrate data. It is designed to collect sensitive information and send it back to the attackers.

Now, let's break down the question:

1. **Data Collection**: The malware collects metadata and content from local systems and removable media.

2. **Additional Data Collection**: It also gathers data from network shared drives.

3. **Data Exfiltration**: The question asks whether it is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after collecting data from network shared drives.

Given that Korplug is a malware designed for exfiltrating data, it is logical to assume that after collecting data from various sources, including network shared drives, it would proceed to exfiltrate that data.

The use of an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol for exfiltration suggests that the malware employs stealthy and secure methods to transmit data without being detected by network security measures.

Considering the nature of Korplug and its purpose, it is plausible that after collecting data from network shared drives, it would proceed with exfiltration using an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
