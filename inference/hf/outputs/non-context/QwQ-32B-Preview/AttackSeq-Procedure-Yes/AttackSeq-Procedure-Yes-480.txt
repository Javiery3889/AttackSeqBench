To answer this question, I need to understand the typical behavior of the Trickbot malware and whether it is known to engage in file deletion as part of its impact tactics, especially on removable and network drives.

First, let's establish what Trickbot is. Trickbot is a modular banking Trojan that has been active since at least 2016. It is known for its versatility and ability to perform a wide range of malicious activities, including information theft, credential harvesting, and serving as a downloader for other malware, such as ransomware.

The question mentions that Trickbot connects to its Command and Control (C2) server to download and execute its payload. This is consistent with its known behavior, as Trickbot is designed to receive instructions and additional modules from its C2 servers to carry out various attacks.

Now, regarding the specific action of deleting files with certain extensions on removable and network drives, I need to consider whether this aligns with Trickbot's typical modus operandi.

Trickbot is primarily a banking Trojan and a downloader, but it has also been used in ransomware attacks, particularly in conjunction with the Ryuk ransomware. In ransomware attacks, file deletion is a common tactic to destroy data and force victims to pay the ransom.

However, Trickbot itself is not primarily known for deleting files as part of its standard operations. Its main functions include stealing sensitive information, conducting man-in-the-browser attacks, and providing a platform for other malware.

That being said, Trickbot's modular design allows it to incorporate various plugins and additional payloads, which could include file-deleting capabilities. If Trickbot is used as a dropper for ransomware like Ryuk, then file deletion could be part of the overall attack sequence, but it would be performed by the ransomware, not Trickbot itself.

Moreover, focusing on removable and network drives, these are common targets for ransomware because they can contain important data that is critical to organizations. However, Trickbot's core functionality does not include targeting these specific types of drives for file deletion.

Given this information, I need to evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Considering that Trickbot is mainly a banking Trojan and downloader, and that file deletion on removable and network drives is more characteristic of ransomware activities, I lean towards answer choice B: No.

However, since Trickbot can be used in conjunction with ransomware, which does engage in file deletion, there might be scenarios where file deletion occurs as part of a larger attack involving Trickbot. But based on Trickbot's primary functions, it is not likely that it would delete files with specific extensions on removable and network drives as part of its own impact tactics.

Therefore, my final answer is:

Final Answer: B
