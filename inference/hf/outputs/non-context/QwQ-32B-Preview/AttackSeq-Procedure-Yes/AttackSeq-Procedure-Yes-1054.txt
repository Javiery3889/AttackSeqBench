So I've got this question here about the Darkhotel APT group and their tactics. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that they've gained victim credentials using an information stealer module targeted at browsers and email services. So, they've already got some credentials from the victims. Now, it's asking whether, after this, they're likely to deploy their keylogger module to capture more input data, which they would then encrypt and store in log files.

I need to decide between "Yes" and "No" for this scenario.

To answer this, I should think about what Darkhotel typically does. Darkhotel is an APT group known for targeting high-profile individuals, often in the hospitality industry, hence the name. They're notorious for using sophisticated techniques to gain access to victims' systems and steal sensitive information.

From what I recall, Darkhotel uses a variety of tools and techniques, including spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links. Once they've gained initial access, they can deploy different modules to carry out various tasks, like stealing credentials, exfiltrating data, and maintaining persistence on the compromised systems.

In this case, they've already used an information stealer module to get credentials from browsers and email services. That suggests they're already pretty deep into the system and have managed to extract some valuable data.

Now, the question is whether they would then use a keylogger to capture more data, specifically input data, which they would encrypt and store in log files.

Well, keyloggers are a common tool for malware to capture keystrokes, which can include passwords, emails, search terms, and other sensitive information that the user types. So, if they've already got some credentials, why would they need to deploy a keylogger?

One possibility is that they want to capture real-time data or data that isn't stored elsewhere, like passwords for new accounts or sensitive communications. Also, keyloggers can capture data from various applications, not just browsers and email clients.

Moreover, encrypting the log files makes sense from a stealth perspective. They wouldn't want their activities to be easily detected if someone were to find the log files. Encrypting them adds an extra layer of protection.

So, considering all this, it does seem plausible that after using an information stealer, they would deploy a keylogger to capture more data and store it securely.

But, I should also consider whether this sequence makes sense in the context of their overall attack strategy. APT groups like Darkhotel are known for their patience and persistence. They often stay潜伏在受害者的系统中很长一段时间，以收集尽可能多的情报。因此，部署一个键盘记录器来捕获持续的输入数据与他们的长期监视策略相一致。

此外，他们可能希望确认最初窃取的凭证是否仍然有效，或者是否有新的凭证被创建。键盘记录器可以帮助他们捕获这些信息。

再者，键盘记录器可以捕获不仅仅是凭证，还包括其他类型的敏感信息，如个人身份信息、财务数据等，这些都可能是APT集团的目标。

因此，从这个角度来看，部署键盘记录器是一个合理的下一步行动。

不过，我也需要考虑一下，是否有可能他们已经获得了足够的信息，不再需要进一步的数据捕获。但鉴于APT集团的贪婪和他们对高价值目标的兴趣，这似乎不太可能。他们很可能想要尽可能多地收集信息。

另外，从技术角度来看，如果他们已经成功部署了一个信息窃取模块，那么部署另一个模块，如键盘记录器，应该是相对 straightforward的，因为他们已经获得了对系统的访问权限。

综上所述，我认为答案是“是的”，他们很可能部署键盘记录器模块来捕获输入数据，并将其加密存储在日志文件中。

**Final Answer**
