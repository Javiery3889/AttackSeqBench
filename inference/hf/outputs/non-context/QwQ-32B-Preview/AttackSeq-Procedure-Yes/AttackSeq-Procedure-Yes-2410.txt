To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the scenario presented is plausible, particularly focusing on the steps involving privilege escalation, DLL injection, and process hollowing to bypass User Account Control (UAC).

First, let's break down the sequence of events as described:

1. **Malicious Macro**: This is a common initial infection vector where an attacker embeds malicious code within a document macro that executes when the document is opened.

2. **Downloads and Executes Second-Stage Downloader**: The macro drops and runs a downloader, which is likely a small executable designed to fetch additional payloads from a command and control (C2) server.

3. **Fetches Encrypted Third-Stage Payload**: The downloader retrieves an encrypted payload, suggesting that the attackers are attempting to evade detection by security solutions that might inspect network traffic or file signatures.

4. **Lokibot Likely to Escalate Privileges**: Lokibot is a known information stealer and banking Trojan. It's plausible that it would attempt to escalate privileges to gain higher-level access to the system.

5. **Injects Malicious DLL into Notepad.exe**: DLL injection is a technique used to execute code in the address space of another process. Injecting into Notepad.exe might be chosen because it's a common, trusted process that users are less likely to suspect.

6. **Employ Process Hollowing to Bypass UAC**: Process hollowing involves creating a new process in a suspended state, replacing its memory with malicious code, and then resuming its execution. This technique can be used to bypass User Account Control (UAC) by making it appear as though a legitimate process is running with elevated privileges.

Now, let's evaluate the plausibility of this sequence:

- **Initial Infection Vector**: Malicious macros are indeed a common method for initial access, so this makes sense.

- **Downloader and Encrypted Payload**: It's standard for malware to use downloaders to fetch additional stages, especially encrypted ones, to avoid detection.

- **Privilege Escalation**: Lokibot, being a sophisticated threat, would likely attempt to escalate privileges to perform more actions on the system.

- **DLL Injection into Notepad.exe**: While DLL injection is a valid technique, choosing Notepad.exe as the host process might not be the most effective choice. Notepad.exe is a simple text editor and may not have the necessary permissions or capabilities that more privileged processes do. Attackers might prefer to inject DLLs into more privileged processes or services.

- **Process Hollowing to Bypass UAC**: Process hollowing is a known technique to bypass UAC by executing code within the context of a elevated process. However, the choice of the process to hollow is crucial. Typically, attackers might target processes that are allowed to run with higher privileges without triggering UAC prompts, such as svchost.exe or lsass.exe.

Considering these points, the sequence seems plausible but has some potential issues:

- **Choice of Host Process**: Notepad.exe is a low-integrity process and may not have the necessary privileges to perform actions that require higher privileges, even if the DLL is injected. Therefore, escalating privileges through DLL injection into Notepad.exe might not achieve the desired elevation.

- **Process Hollowing**: If the goal is to bypass UAC, hollowing a process that is already allowed to run with elevated privileges without triggering a UAC prompt would be more effective. Hollowing Notepad.exe might not necessarily grant higher privileges, as Notepad.exe typically runs with standard user permissions.

Given these considerations, it seems that the sequence described may not be the most effective approach for privilege escalation. Attackers would likely choose a different process for injection and hollowing that has higher privileges or is more suited for elevation.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
