To answer this question, I need to understand the behavior of the Milestone backdoor and how it interacts with Command and Control (C2) servers, particularly in relation to the activities mentioned: system information discovery, screen capture, and data exfiltration.

First, let's break down the components of the question:

1. **System Information Discovery**: This refers to the backdoor gathering details about the compromised system, such as operating system version, installed software, running processes, etc. This information is often useful for the attacker to understand the environment and decide on further actions.

2. **Screen Capture**: This involves the backdoor taking screenshots of the user's activities on the compromised machine. This can be used to gather sensitive information, monitor user behavior, or capture credentials.

3. **Communication with C2 Server**: This is the channel through which the backdoor sends collected data to the attacker's server and receives further instructions.

4. **Application Layer Protocol**: This likely refers to protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc., which are used for transmitting data over the network at the application layer.

5. **Data Exfiltration**: This is the process of transferring the collected data (like system information and screen captures) from the compromised system to the attacker's server.

Now, the question is asking whether, after performing system information discovery and screen capture, the Milestone backdoor will communicate with the C2 server over an application layer protocol before exfiltrating the data through the same C2 channel.

To answer this, I need to consider the typical behavior of backdoors like Milestone and how they handle communication and data exfiltration.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Initial Communication**: Backdoors often establish a connection to the C2 server to check in and receive instructions. This initial communication is crucial for the attacker to gain control over the compromised system.

2. **Data Collection**: Once the backdoor is active and connected to the C2 server, it may perform various actions based on the attacker's commands, such as discovering system information and capturing screens.

3. **Data Exfiltration**: After collecting the required data, the backdoor needs to transmit this data back to the C2 server. This transmission typically occurs over the same communication channel established earlier.

4. **Application Layer Protocols**: Using application layer protocols like HTTP or HTTPS for communication provides several advantages, including evasion of network filters and blending in with normal traffic.

Given this sequence, it is plausible that after performing system information discovery and screen capture, the Milestone backdoor would communicate with the C2 server over an application layer protocol to exfiltrate the data.

However, the question specifies whether it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C2 server over the application layer protocol **before** exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.

Let's consider this timing:

- **Before Exfiltration**: If the backdoor needs to request permission or specific instructions on what data to exfiltrate, it might communicate with the C2 server before proceeding with data exfiltration.

- **During Exfiltration**: The exfiltration itself would involve communication over the application layer protocol to transmit the data.

Given that the backdoor has already performed system information discovery and screen capture, it might have the data ready to be exfiltrated. In this case, the immediate communication before exfiltration could be to signal that the data is ready and to receive confirmation or specific exfiltration instructions.

Therefore, it is likely that there would be some communication with the C2 server before the actual exfiltration takes place, to coordinate the data transfer.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the Milestone backdoor would communicate with the C2 server over the application layer protocol before exfiltrating the data through the same C2 channel, especially after performing actions like system information discovery and screen capture.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
