To answer this question, let's break down the components and analyze the sequence of events described.

First, the question mentions that the Smooth Operator malware establishes communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. This suggests that the malware is designed to communicate securely and hide its activities from network monitoring tools.

Next, it asks whether, after these initial steps, the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via a second-stage payload using an HTTP GET request.

Let's consider the implications:

1. **Communication over HTTPS:** Using HTTPS indicates that the malware authors are concerned about encrypting the communication to avoid detection. HTTPS provides a layer of security by encrypting the data in transit.

2. **Custom data encoding algorithm:** In addition to HTTPS, the malware uses a custom encoding algorithm to further obfuscate the data. This suggests an attempt to make the data unreadable not only to external observers but also to make it harder for security tools to inspect the content.

3. **Second-stage payload using HTTP GET request:** The question is whether, after these secure communications, the malware would switch to using a less secure method like HTTP GET for exfiltrating data.

Now, let's evaluate the plausibility of this sequence:

- **HTTPS vs. HTTP:** HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because it encrypts the data, whereas HTTP sends data in plain text. If the malware has gone to the trouble of using HTTPS and custom encoding for initial communication, it's unlikely to downgrade to plain HTTP for exfiltration, as this could expose the data to detection.

- **Consistency in security measures:** Malware that employs advanced techniques to hide its communications would likely maintain that level of caution throughout its operations. Switching to HTTP GET for exfiltration could be seen as inconsistent with the initial security measures.

- **Detection risks:** Using HTTP GET for exfiltration could raise red flags, as unexpected HTTP traffic, especially with large data payloads, might be detected by security systems. Given that the malware has already established a secure channel via HTTPS, it's more plausible that it would continue using that channel for exfiltration.

- **Efficiency and control:** Maintaining a single communication channel (HTTPS) for both command and control and data exfiltration could be more efficient and easier to manage from the attacker's perspective.

Considering these points, it seems unlikely that the malware would switch to HTTP GET for exfiltration after establishing a secure HTTPS connection and using custom encoding.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
