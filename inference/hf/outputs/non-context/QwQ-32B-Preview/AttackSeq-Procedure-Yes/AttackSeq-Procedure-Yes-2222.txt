To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the mentioned tools are likely to be used during the discovery phase by the threat actor, Earth Lusca.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - Spear phishing
   - Malicious JavaScript in watering hole attacks

2. **Execution:**
   - Cobalt Strike loader disguised as a system update service

3. **Discovery Phase:**
   - Tools in question: HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, fscan

The question is whether it's likely that Earth Lusca will use these specific tools for network service discovery during the discovery phase.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the TTPs:**
   - **Spear Phishing and Watering Hole Attacks:** These are common initial access vectors used by many threat groups to compromise targets.
   - **Cobalt Strike Loader:** Cobalt Strike is a popular penetration testing tool that can be abused by attackers. Disguising it as a system update service is a sophisticated technique to evade detection.

2. **Discovery Phase:**
   - In the discovery phase, threat actors typically seek to understand the environment they've gained access to. This includes identifying active users, host information, installed software, and mapping the network to find high-value targets.

3. **Tools in Question:**
   - **HUC Port Banner Scanner:** This tool is used to scan ports and retrieve banner information, which can help identify services running on those ports.
   - **nbtscan:** This tool is used to query NetBIOS names and can help in enumerating hosts and their roles in a Windows network.
   - **fscan:** This is another port scanner that can be used to discover open ports and services.

4. **Likelihood of Use:**
   - These tools are basic network enumeration tools that can be useful in the discovery phase.
   - However, sophisticated threat groups often use custom or more stealthy tools to avoid detection.
   - Cobalt Strike itself has built-in capabilities for network discovery, such as port scanning and service enumeration, which might make the use of external tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan less necessary.

5. **Indicator of Compromise (IoC):**
   - The use of these specific tools could be an indicator of a less sophisticated actor or one that hasn't invested in custom tools.
   - Given that Earth Lusca has demonstrated sophistication in initial access and execution phases, using such tools might not align with their overall TTPs.

6. **Context from MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**
   - According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, techniques like "Port Scan" (T1046) and "Network Service Scanning" (T1018) are part of the discovery phase.
   - However, the specific tools used can vary widely, and threat groups may prefer certain tools based on their preferences and the need to evade defenses.

### Conclusion:

Given that Earth Lusca has shown sophistication in their initial access and execution phases, using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery might be less likely. These tools are more basic and could potentially draw attention, whereas Cobalt Strike offers built-in capabilities for network discovery that can be used more stealthily.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
