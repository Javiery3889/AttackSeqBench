To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is about an adversary's actions after using Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and discovery. Specifically, it's asking whether the adversary is likely to copy the results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives, before exfiltrating this data using cloud storage web services.

Let's consider the context:

1. **Cobalt Strike and Lateral Movement:**
   - Cobalt Strike is a popular red team tool that adversaries use for various activities, including lateral movement within a network.
   - Lateral movement techniques allow adversaries to move from one compromised system to another, often to access more sensitive data or systems.

2. **Discovery Phase:**
   - During the discovery phase, adversaries gather information about the network, systems, and data present.
   - This can include identifying file shares, directories, and other resources that may contain valuable data.

3. **Copying Discovery Results:**
   - The question specifies that the adversary copies the results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives.
   - This suggests that the adversary is collecting metadata about the data available before deciding what to exfiltrate.

4. **Exfiltration via Cloud Storage:**
   - The adversary plans to exfiltrate this data using cloud storage web services.
   - Cloud storage services like Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, etc., can be used to transfer data out of the network discreetly.

Now, let's evaluate the likelihood of this sequence of actions:

- **Step 1: Lateral Movement with Cobalt Strike**
  - Adversaries use Cobalt Strike to move laterally and gain access to more systems within the network.
  - This is a common tactic in many cyber-attacks.

- **Step 2: Identification of Target Systems and Data**
  - Once lateral movement is achieved, adversaries identify systems and data of interest.
  - This involves reconnaissance and discovery activities.

- **Step 3: Copying Discovery Results**
  - Adversaries might copy file and directory lists to have a map of the network's data landscape.
  - This helps them prioritize which data to exfiltrate based on sensitivity and value.

- **Step 4: Exfiltration Using Cloud Storage**
  - Transferring data via cloud storage services can be an effective exfiltration method because it blends in with normal web traffic.
  - It also allows for large data transfers without setting up custom exfiltration channels.

Considering the above points, it is plausible that an adversary would follow this sequence of actions. Here's why:

- **Efficiency:** Copying discovery results allows adversaries to efficiently identify and prioritize the most valuable data to exfiltrate.
- **Stealth:** Using cloud storage services for exfiltration can help avoid detection, as this traffic might not be closely monitored.
- **Practicality:** Many organizations have legitimate use of cloud storage services, making such exfiltration attempts harder to distinguish from normal traffic.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes," it is plausible that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating data using cloud storage web services.

**Final Answer: A**
