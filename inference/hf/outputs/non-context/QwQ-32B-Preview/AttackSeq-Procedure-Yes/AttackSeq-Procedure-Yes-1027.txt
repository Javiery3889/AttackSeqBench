So I've got this question here about Gamaredon group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Gamaredon uses backdoors to automatically list interesting files on a system for future exfiltration. That makes sense; once they've gained access, they'd want to identify valuable data to steal.

Then, it asks if it's likely that they will use malware to take screenshots every minute. Screenshots can be useful for attackers to understand the environment, monitor user activities, or capture sensitive information that might not be stored in files, like passwords being typed in real-time.

Finally, the question mentions that they employ HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (C2). This is common; using HTTP and HTTPS allows them to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.

Now, the answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No," so I need to decide whether this sequence of TTPs is likely for Gamaredon.

To answer this, I need to know a bit about Gamaredon's known TTPs. Gamaredon is a cyber threat group that has been active since at least 2015, primarily targeting Eastern European governments, think tanks, and other organizations. They are known for their spear-phishing attacks, use of custom malware, and data exfiltration.

From what I recall, Gamaredon does use backdoors to maintain access to compromised systems and to exfiltrate data. They are also known to use malware for various purposes, including information gathering.

Taking screenshots every minute seems a bit excessive. Most attackers aim for efficiency and stealth; taking screenshots at such a high frequency could generate a lot of data and potentially raise red flags if system performance is monitored.

However, it's possible that in certain scenarios, they might use screen capture techniques, but perhaps not at such a high frequency. Maybe they trigger screen captures based on specific events or user activities.

Moreover, using HTTP and HTTPS for C2 is standard practice for many threat groups, including Gamaredon. It allows them to communicate with their malware on compromised systems in a way that is difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic.

So, considering all this, is it likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute before employing HTTP and HTTPS for C2?

Hmm. While it's possible, it seems a bit extreme. Most groups would be more selective about when and how often they take screenshots to avoid drawing attention to their activities.

Perhaps a better approach would be to take screenshots only when certain keywords are detected or when specific applications are in use, rather than continuously every minute.

Therefore, I would lean towards answering "No," it's not likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute.

But to be thorough, I should check if there's any known evidence or reports that suggest Gamaredon uses such aggressive screen capture techniques.

Upon a quick search, I recall that Gamaredon has used malware like QuasarRAT, which has screen capture capabilities. However, I don't have specific information on how frequently they use this feature.

In general, though, continuous screen capturing at one-minute intervals seems overly aggressive and likely to increase the risk of detection.

Therefore, based on the available information and the need for stealth in their operations, I believe the answer is "No."

**Final Answer:**

\[ \boxed{\text{B: No}} \]
