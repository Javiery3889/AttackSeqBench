To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is about the PIVY variant of malware and its behavior after evading defenses through specific techniques. It mentions that PIVY uses DLL sideloading to load a dropped DLL and modifies its configuration to confuse tools that parse configuration data. Then, it asks whether, after these actions, the malware is likely to communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.

So, let's understand what each part means.

DLL sideloading is a technique where malware places a malicious DLL in the same directory as a legitimate executable, taking advantage of how Windows searches for DLLs. When the legitimate executable loads, it loads the malicious DLL instead of the intended one, allowing the malware to execute its code.

Modifying the configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data suggests that the malware is trying to obfuscate its settings or commands to make it harder for security tools to detect its activities.

Now, after performing these actions, the question is whether the malware will likely communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.

C2 servers are used by malware to receive commands from attackers or to exfiltrate data back to them. Communication with C2 servers is a common activity for malware once it has compromised a system.

Application layer protocols typically refer to protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc., which operate at the application layer of the TCP/IP model. These protocols are often used for C2 communications because they are allowed through most firewalls and are less likely to be blocked.

Given that the malware has already evaded defenses and modified its configuration, it is logical to assume that it would proceed to communicate with its C2 servers to receive further instructions or upload stolen data.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.

But let's consider if there are any reasons to think otherwise.

One might argue that if the malware has been detected or if there are additional defenses in place, it might not communicate with C2 servers. However, the question states that the malware has already evaded defenses by using DLL sideloading and modifying its configuration, which suggests that it has successfully compromised the system without being detected.

Another consideration is whether the malware needs to communicate with C2 servers at this stage. Malware often has built-in functionalities that can be triggered without immediate C2 communication, but communicating with C2 servers is a standard procedure for receiving updated commands or downloading additional payloads.

Moreover, the fact that specific C2 server domains are mentioned (webserver.servehttp[.]com and admin.nslookupdns[.]com) suggests that these are part of the malware's operational infrastructure, and it is expected to communicate with them.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware will likely communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.

So, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
