To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the context provided in the question. Dexphot is a type of malware, and the question is asking about its likely behavior after using a specific technique called process hollowing during the execution stage. Process hollowing is a method where malware injects its code into a legitimate process, often to evade detection by security software.

The question then asks whether, after using process hollowing, Dexphot is likely to utilize fileless techniques for defense evasion to prevent detection and obfuscate its activities.

So, let's define some key terms to ensure we're on the same page:

1. **Process Hollowing**: This is a technique where malware creates a new instance of a legitimate process in a suspended state, replaces its memory with malicious code, and then resumes its execution. This makes the malware run within the context of a legitimate process, making it harder to detect.

2. **Fileless Techniques**: These are methods where malware operates primarily in memory without writing any files to the disk. This can make it more difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect the malware since there are no malicious files to scan.

Now, the question is asking whether, after using process hollowing, Dexphot is likely to use fileless techniques for further defense evasion.

Let's consider the following points:

- **Process Hollowing and Fileless Techniques Relationship**: Process hollowing is itself a technique that can be part of a fileless attack because it involves executing code in memory without necessarily writing it to disk. So, using process hollowing already aligns with fileless tactics.

- **Defense Evasion**: Malware often employs multiple evasion techniques to avoid detection. If Dexphot uses process hollowing, it might also use other fileless techniques to further hide its presence and activities.

- **Plausibility**: It's plausible that after using process hollowing, Dexphot would continue to use fileless techniques to maintain its stealth. This is because once the malware is executing in memory within a legitimate process, it can perform various actions without leaving traces on the disk, which helps in evading detection.

Given these points, the answer seems to be that yes, Dexphot is likely to utilize fileless techniques for defense evasion after using process hollowing.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
