To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events and evaluate the likelihood of the described behavior.

First, the question mentions that the Aurora malware modifies the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL and loads the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection. These are tactics used to hide the malware's presence and make it harder for security solutions to identify the malicious activity.

Now, the question asks whether, after performing these actions, it is likely that the malware will communicate with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.

Let's consider each part of this proposed sequence:

1. **File-time modification**: This is a technique used to make the malware's files appear legitimate by matching their timestamps with those of genuine system files. It's a way to evade detection by file integrity monitors.

2. **Loading DLL into svchost.exe**: Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts multiple Windows services. By injecting its DLL into svchost.exe, the malware can hide its activity within a trusted process, making it harder to detect.

3. **Communicating with C&C over port 443**: Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS traffic, which is encrypted. Using this port for C&C communication can help the malware blend in with normal network traffic and evade network-based detection.

4. **Using a weak custom encryption scheme**: This part is a bit contradictory. If the malware is communicating over port 443, which is typically used for HTTPS, it's expected to use standard TLS encryption. Using a weak custom encryption scheme could raise red flags and make the communication easier to detect and intercept.

Given these points, let's evaluate the likelihood:

- The first two actions (file-time modification and DLL injection into svchost.exe) are sophisticated tactics aimed at evading detection.

- Communicating over port 443 is a common practice in malware to avoid network detection.

- However, using a weak custom encryption scheme over port 443 seems inconsistent. If the malware is already using port 443, which is associated with HTTPS, it would be more plausible for it to use standard TLS encryption to blend in properly.

Moreover, using a weak custom encryption scheme could be a mistake or an oversight by the malware authors, but it's generally not a recommended practice as it can make the communication easier to decrypt and analyze.

Therefore, considering that the earlier steps in the sequence are designed to evade detection, it's unlikely that the malware would then use a weak custom encryption scheme for C&C communication, as this could compromise the overall stealth of the operation.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
