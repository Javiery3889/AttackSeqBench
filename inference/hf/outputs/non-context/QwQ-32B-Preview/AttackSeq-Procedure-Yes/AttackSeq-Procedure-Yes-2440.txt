To answer this question, let's break down the components and analyze them step by step.

First, the question mentions that the Elise malware injects a DLL (NavShExt.dll) into the Internet Explorer process and creates a mutex named 'donotbotherme' to prevent multiple instances from running. Then, it asks whether it's likely that the malware will employ defense evasion techniques such as heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation while exfiltrating data to the C2 server.

Let's consider what these components imply:

1. **DLL Injection**: Injecting a DLL into a legitimate process like Internet Explorer is a common tactic used by malware to hide its presence and gain access to the process's resources and permissions. This is typically associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055.001 - Process Injection.

2. **Mutex Creation**: Creating a mutex to prevent multiple instances of the malware from running is a way to ensure that only one instance is active at a time. This can help avoid detection by security software that might look for multiple instances of suspicious behavior. This aligns with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1112 - Mutex.

3. **Defense Evasion Techniques**: The question specifically mentions "heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation." These are both evasion techniques used by malware to avoid analysis in virtualized environments and to make reverse engineering more difficult.

   - **Anti-Virtual Machine (Anti-VM) Techniques**: These are methods used by malware to detect if it's running in a virtual machine, which is often used by security researchers to analyze malware behavior. If the malware detects a VM, it might alter its behavior or cease operations to avoid detection. This corresponds to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1057 - Process Discovery, among others.

   - **Obfuscation**: This involves modifying the code to make it harder to understand or analyze without changing its functionality. Obfuscation can be applied to various parts of the malware, including the communication with the C2 server. This relates to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information.

4. **Data Exfiltration**: The final part of the sequence involves exfiltrating data to the C2 server. This is a common post-compromise activity where the malware gathers sensitive information and sends it back to the attacker.

Given this context, we need to determine whether it's likely that the Elise malware will employ these specific defense evasion techniques during the data exfiltration phase.

Let's consider the following points:

- **Purpose of Defense Evasion**: Defense evasion techniques are employed to avoid detection and analysis by security solutions and researchers. This is crucial for the malware to remain undetected for as long as possible and to successfully carry out its objectives, including data exfiltration.

- **Commonality of Techniques**: Anti-VM techniques and obfuscation are indeed common in malware. Many advanced malware samples include such features to thwart analysis in sandbox environments and to make reverse engineering more challenging.

- **Sequence of Events**: The sequence described—DLL injection, mutex creation, and then data exfiltration—suggests a structured approach to ensuring the malware's execution and persistence. Including defense evasion techniques during data exfiltration would be logical to protect this critical phase.

- **Plausibility**: Given that the malware has already employed process injection and mutex creation, which are evasion techniques themselves, it is plausible that it would also use more advanced evasion techniques like anti-VM features and obfuscation, especially during data exfiltration when the risk of detection is higher.

Based on this analysis, it is likely that the Elise malware will employ defense evasion techniques such as heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation while exfiltrating data to the C2 server.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
