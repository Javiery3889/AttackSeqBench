I've got this question here about backdoors and their behavior after exfiltrating data. Let's see what it's asking. So, the scenario is that there's a backdoor installed by attackers, and this backdoor has been exfiltrating data over some command and control (C&C) channel using encrypted communication. Now, the question is whether, after doing this, it's likely that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.

The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." So, I need to decide which one makes more sense based on what I know about backdoors and attacker behavior.

First, I should think about what the goal of a backdoor is. A backdoor is essentially a hidden entry point that allows attackers to gain access to a system without being detected. The primary objective is usually to maintain persistent access to the compromised system for various purposes, such as data exfiltration, launching further attacks, or spying.

Exfiltrating data is one of the key activities once a system is compromised. Using encrypted communication for this purpose helps the attackers avoid detection by security systems that might be monitoring network traffic.

Now, regarding shutting down the victim's computer: would that be likely? Well, shutting down a computer would certainly disrupt operations and impact system availability, which could be seen as a disruptive act. However, most backdoors are designed to remain stealthy and avoid drawing attention to themselves. Disrupting the system to the point where it shuts down could alert the victim to the presence of the backdoor or the compromise.

Moreover, if the backdoor shuts down the system, it might also terminate its own processes, which wouldn't be beneficial for the attackers who want to maintain persistent access. They would have to find a way to regain access after the system is restarted, which could be risky and might alert security personnel if they notice unusual reboot patterns.

On the other hand, some attackers might employ disruptive tactics as part of their attack strategy, especially in the case of ransomware or other types of destructive attacks. But in the context of a backdoor that's been exfiltrating data, the primary goal seems to be stealth and持续 access rather than disruption.

Additionally, if the backdoor were to shut down the system, it might not be able to continue communicating with the C&C server, which could interrupt the exfiltration process or other ongoing activities.

Considering all this, it seems less likely that a backdoor designed for data exfiltration and maintaining access would shut down the victim's computer. The disruption could alert the victim to the compromise and potentially disrupt the backdoor's own operations.

Therefore, I think the answer is "No," it is not likely that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: B**
