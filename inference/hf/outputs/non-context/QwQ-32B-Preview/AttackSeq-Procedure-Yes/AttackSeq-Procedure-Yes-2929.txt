To answer this question, we need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine whether the given actions are likely to lead to communication with C&C servers and the uploading of keystroke logs by the CWoolger keylogger.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Persistence via VBScript ('wsc.vbs')**: This suggests that the malware is using a VBScript to achieve persistence on the target system. Persistence mechanisms are common in malware to ensure that they continue to run across system reboots or user logouts.

2. **Creation of a mutex ('woolger')**: Mutexes (short for mutual exclusion objects) are often used by malware to ensure that only one instance of the malware is running at a time, which can be a part of their defense evasion tactics.

3. **Defense evasion mechanisms**: This indicates that the malware is taking steps to avoid detection and analysis, which is a standard practice for malware to prolong its operational life on a target system.

4. **Communication with C&C servers**: This is a critical function for malware, as it allows the attackers to receive data from the infected system and issue commands to the malware.

5. **CWoolger keylogger uploading keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers**: This specifies a particular action where the keylogger component of the malware is supposed to send collected keystrokes to the command and control servers when the log size exceeds 3,000 bytes.

Now, let's evaluate the plausibility of these events based on typical malware behavior:

- **Persistence and Defense Evasion**: These are foundational steps for most malware. Establishing persistence ensures the malware remains on the system, and defense evasion techniques help it avoid detection by security software or system administrators.

- **Communication with C&C**: Once persistence and evasion are achieved, malware typically needs to communicate with its operators to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. This is a standard step in the malware lifecycle.

- **Keylogger Operation**: If the malware includes a keylogger, it would logically collect keystrokes and, at some point, need to transmit this data back to the attackers. Setting a threshold for the log size (e.g., 3,000 bytes) before transmission is a common technique to balance data exfiltration with avoiding drawing attention through frequent communications.

Given this analysis, it is plausible that after achieving persistence and setting up defense evasion mechanisms, the GHOLE malware would proceed to communicate with its C&C servers and that the CWoolger keylogger would upload keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to those servers.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
