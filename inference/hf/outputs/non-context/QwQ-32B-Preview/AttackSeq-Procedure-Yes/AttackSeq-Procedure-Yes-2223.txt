To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and determine whether it's plausible that Earth Lusca, presumably an attacker or threat actor, would proceed to exploit remote services and perform lateral movement by setting up network tunnels after using scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and the command provided.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. **Scanning Tools Used:**
   - HUC Port Banner Scanner
   - Command: `hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443`

This command is scanning a range of IP addresses from 172.16.10.1 to 172.16.10.254 on specific ports: 445 (SMB), 3389 (RDP), 1433 (Microsoft SQL Server), 3306 (MySQL), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS). This is a typical reconnaissance step where an attacker is trying to identify which hosts are active and which services are running on them.

2. **Phase: Discovery Phase**
   - This is the initial stage of an attack where the attacker gathers information about the target network, identifies potential entry points, and maps out the network topology.

3. **Proposed Actions:**
   - Exploit remote services
   - Engage in lateral movement
   - Establish network tunnels between the target's network and external servers

Now, let's consider whether these actions are likely to follow the discovery phase based on the scanning activities described.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Reconnaissance and Scanning:**
   - The use of scanning tools to identify open ports and services is standard in the reconnaissance phase. This helps the attacker understand what services are exposed and which ones might have vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

2. **Exploiting Remote Services:**
   - Once the attacker has identified which services are running on the target hosts, the next logical step would be to look for vulnerabilities in those services that can be exploited to gain access. For example, if port 445 (SMB) is open, the attacker might look for known SMB vulnerabilities like EternalBlue.

3. **Lateral Movement:**
   - After gaining initial access to one host, the attacker may seek to move laterally within the network to access more sensitive areas or higher-value targets. This often involves exploiting trust relationships, credentials, or other vulnerabilities to gain access to other systems.

4. **Establishing Network Tunnels:**
   - Setting up network tunnels can be a way for attackers to maintain persistent access, exfiltrate data, or to route traffic through the compromised network for other malicious purposes. Tunnels can be established using various protocols and tools, and they allow for a more controlled and sometimes encrypted communication channel.

Given this sequence, it does make sense that after the discovery phase, an attacker would attempt to exploit identified services, move laterally within the network, and set up tunnels for sustained access or other objectives.

However, the question is whether it's "likely" that Earth Lusca will take these steps based solely on the information provided about the discovery phase. While the actions described are plausible and align with common attack patterns, there is no explicit information provided about Earth Lusca's intentions or capabilities beyond the initial scanning activities.

**Evaluating Answer Choices:**

A: Yes

B: No

**Reasoning:**

- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the typical progression of an attack. After scanning and identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting those vulnerabilities, moving laterally, and setting up tunnels are standard steps in many attack scenarios.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that these actions are not likely to follow the discovery phase, which contradicts common attack patterns. However, without more specific information about Earth Lusca's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), it's possible that their approach differs from standard attack methodologies.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the standard progression of cyber attacks and the activities described in the discovery phase, it is likely that Earth Lusca will proceed to exploit remote services, engage in lateral movement, and establish network tunnels. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
