To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events and understand the typical behavior of malware in such scenarios.

First, the attack vector is social engineering, where users are tricked into downloading a fake app from a malicious website. This is a common initial access tactic used by many threat actors, including Tortoiseshell.

Once the malicious payload is downloaded and executed, it's likely that the malware will perform several actions to establish a foothold and maintain persistence on the compromised system. One of the key objectives is to install a Remote Access Tool (RAT) like 'IvizTech' to allow the attacker remote control over the system.

Now, regarding the execution of binaries before the RAT is installed and executed as a service, it's essential to consider the malware's functionality and the sequence of operations.

Typically, when a malware downloader is executed, it may perform the following steps:

1. **Payload Delivery**: The malicious app is downloaded and executed by the user.

2. **Execution of Malicious Binaries**: The downloader may execute additional binaries or components necessary for the infection process. These could include droppers, loaders, or other tools needed to install the main payload.

3. **Installation of the RAT**: The downloader would then proceed to install the RAT, such as 'IvizTech', on the system. This often involves copying the RAT executable to a specific directory and configuring it to start automatically at system boot or logon.

4. **Service Creation for Persistence**: To maintain persistence, the RAT might be registered as a system service, ensuring it starts automatically even after system reboots.

Given this sequence, it is plausible that the malware downloader executes binaries before the RAT is installed and executed as a service. These executed binaries could be part of the infection chain, helping to set up the environment for the RAT or performing additional malicious activities.

Therefore, considering the typical behavior of malware downloaders and the need to execute additional components before installing the main payload, the answer is likely "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
