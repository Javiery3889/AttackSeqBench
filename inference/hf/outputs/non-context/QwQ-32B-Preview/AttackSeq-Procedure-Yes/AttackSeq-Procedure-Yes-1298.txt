So I've got this question here about a cyber attack sequence, and I need to figure out if the campaign is likely to employ T1107, which is File Deletion, as part of defense evasion between exploiting a vulnerability and stealing credentials. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction. I need to know what that CVE is all about. A quick search tells me that CVE-2017-11882 is related to a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office WordPad. So, attackers can exploit this to run arbitrary code on a target system without the user's knowledge.

Next, after exploiting this vulnerability, the attackers aim to steal stored passwords and access tokens using techniques like Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry. These are common tactics used by attackers to gain further access and privileges within a network.

Now, the question is asking whether, in between these steps, the campaign is likely to employ T1107, which is File Deletion, as part of defense evasion. So, I need to think about why an attacker might delete files as part of their evasion tactics.

Defense evasion techniques are used by attackers to prevent detection and analysis of their activities. File deletion could be one such methodâ€”by removing traces of their activities or deleting logs that could be used to trace their steps.

But, in the context of this specific sequence, is file deletion likely to be employed? Let's consider the sequence:

1. Exploit CVE-2017-11882 for initial access and code execution.

2. (Potentially) Perform defense evasion techniques.

3. Steal credentials using Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry.

I need to think about whether deleting files would make sense at this stage. After exploiting the vulnerability and gaining initial access, attackers might want to clean up any artifacts left behind from the exploitation phase to avoid detection. This could include deleting temporary files created during the exploit or modifying logs to remove signs of the initial compromise.

Additionally, when preparing to steal credentials, attackers might delete certain files or logs that could reveal their presence or activities. For example, they might delete event logs or other monitoring data that could indicate unauthorized access or activities related to credential dumping.

On the other hand, credential dumping and accessing the registry for credentials are activities that might not necessarily require file deletion immediately before or after. However, to evade detection, attackers might choose to delete files or logs that could expose their actions.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, T1107: File Deletion is indeed listed under Defense Evasion. The technique involves removing files to prevent detection or analysis. Attackers may delete files they've used, logs that record their activities, or other evidence that could be used to identify their presence.

Given this, it does seem plausible that the campaign would employ file deletion as part of their defense evasion strategy between exploiting the vulnerability and stealing credentials.

But, let's consider the alternatives. Maybe there are other defense evasion techniques that are more likely or more effective in this scenario. For example, attackers could use techniques like Indicator Removal on Host, where they modify system data to prevent detection, or they could use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide their tools and data.

However, file deletion is a straightforward and common method to remove evidence. It's likely that attackers would use a combination of defense evasion techniques, and file deletion could be one of them.

Moreover, in the context of the attack sequence described, file deletion would make sense as a way to cover their tracks after gaining initial access and before proceeding to steal credentials. This could help prevent defenders from detecting the initial breach or understanding the extent of the attacker's activities.

Therefore, considering the sequence and the purpose of defense evasion, it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107: File Deletion.

So, my answer would be A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
