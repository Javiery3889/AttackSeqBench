To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the sequence outlined in the question is plausible based on known malware behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** T9000 malware gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 through an RTF file.

2. **Next Steps:** It is alleged that the malware then utilizes `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll` for subsequent execution.

3. **Persistence:** Finally, it achieves persistence by modifying registry keys or injecting `ResN32.dll` into `explorer.exe`.

I need to evaluate if this sequence is likely, given what is known about malware behavior and the specific techniques mentioned.

### Step 1: Understanding the Initial Access

CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 are both vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office that allow for remote code execution through malicious RTF files. This is a common initial access vector for malware, so this part makes sense.

### Step 2: Sideload Malicious DLL via `igfxtray.exe`

`igfxtray.exe` is a legitimate executable associated with Intel graphics drivers. It's known that some malware can abuse trusted binaries to execute malicious code, a technique known as "living off the land" (T1059 in MITRE ATT&CK).

Sidelading DLLs is a technique where a malicious DLL is placed in a directory where it will be loaded by a legitimate executable. This is often achieved by exploiting the way Windows searches for DLLs.

So, it's plausible that T9000 malware could use `igfxtray.exe` to load a malicious DLL like `hccutils.dll`.

### Step 3: Achieving Persistence

Persistence can be achieved through various methods, including modifying registry keys (T1112) or injecting DLLs into processes (T1050).

- **Modifying Registry Keys:** Malware often adds registry entries to ensure it runs at startup.

- **Injecting DLLs:** Injecting a DLL like `ResN32.dll` into `explorer.exe` is another way to maintain persistence and execute code within the context of a long-running process.

Both of these methods are common and align with known malware behaviors.

### Evaluating the Sequence

The sequence described seems logical:

1. **Initial Access:** Exploit vulnerabilities in an RTF file to gain entry.

2. **Execution:** Use a trusted binary to load a malicious DLL, thereby executing code in the context of a legitimate process.

3. **Persistence:** Ensure continued access by modifying registry keys or injecting a DLL into a persistent process.

Each step builds upon the previous one, following a typical malware infection chain.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis above, it is likely that T9000 malware would follow the sequence of TTPs as described in the question. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
