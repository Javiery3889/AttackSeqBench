To answer this question, I need to analyze the behavior of Scote malware and understand its approach to evading detection and communicating with its command and control (C2) servers. The question mentions that Scote uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information, specifically mentioning Pastebin postings and Google+ accounts. The key point here is whether Scote retrieves C2 information from these platforms before communicating with the actual C2 servers to receive commands.

First, let's break down the sequence of events as described:

1. **Evading Detection:** Scote employs various techniques to avoid being detected by security measures.

2. **Using Legitimate Services:** It utilizes well-known online services like Pastebin and Google+ to host C2 information.

3. **Retrieving C2 Information:** Before connecting to the actual C2 servers, it fetches information from these postings or accounts.

4. **Accepting Commands:** Finally, it communicates with the C2 servers to receive further instructions.

Now, I need to evaluate whether this sequence is plausible, specifically focusing on the use of Pastebin and Google+ for hosting C2 information.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Understanding C2 Communication:**
   - Malware often uses C2 servers to receive instructions, exfiltrate data, and download additional payloads.
   - To evade detection, malware may use domain generation algorithms (DGAs), fast-flux networks, or third-party services to hide the location of C2 servers.

2. **Use of Third-Party Services:**
   - Malware authors sometimes leverage legitimate services like Pastebin, Google Docs, or social media platforms to host C2 information.
   - This approach can help them avoid scrutiny because these services are trusted and frequently used, making it harder for security solutions to flag them as malicious.

3. **Pastebin and Google+ Specifically:**
   - **Pastebin:** A popular platform for sharing text snippets. It has been abused by malware authors to host C2 URLs, encryption keys, or other instructions.
   - **Google+:** A social networking platform owned by Google. While it has been used for various purposes, including malware C2 communications, its usage has declined significantly since 2019, and the service was shut down in 2019.

4. **Sequence of Actions:**
   - The malware first retrieves C2 information from these online services.
   - Then, it uses this information to communicate with the actual C2 servers to accept commands.

**Evaluation of Plausibility:**

- **Using Pastebin for C2 Information:**
  - Plausible. Pastebin is widely used and has been abused by malware for C2 communications due to its accessibility and lack of immediate scrutiny.

- **Using Google+ for C2 Information:**
  - Less plausible, especially considering that Google+ was shut down in 2019. Malware authors would be unlikely to rely on a service that is no longer active.

- **Sequence of Retrieval and Communication:**
  - It makes sense for malware to first fetch C2 information from a public source before initiating communication with the actual C2 servers. This adds an extra layer of indirection, making it harder for security researchers to trace back to the real C2 infrastructure.

**Conclusion:**

Given that Pastebin is a commonly abused service for C2 communications and Google+ was shut down in 2019, making its use unlikely, the sequence described in the question seems partially plausible. However, the inclusion of Google+ raises concerns about the accuracy of the statement, especially considering the timeline.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
