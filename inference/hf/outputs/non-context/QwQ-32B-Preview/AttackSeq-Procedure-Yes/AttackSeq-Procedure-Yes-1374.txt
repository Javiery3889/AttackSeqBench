To answer this question, we need to understand the sequence of actions that a malicious group, in this case, the 'Recon' module group, might take after infiltrating a target system. The question presents a specific sequence: collecting initial system information like browser history and cached credentials before checking Internet connectivity and obtaining the external IP address using the 'Wnhttp' module.

First, let's break down the actions mentioned:

1. **Collecting initial system information**: This includes gathering data such as browser history and cached credentials. This type of activity is typically associated with reconnaissance, where attackers seek to understand the environment and gather valuable data.

2. **Checking Internet connectivity and obtaining external IP address**: This action is often performed to ensure that the malware can communicate with its command and control (C2) servers and to identify the system's presence on the internet.

Now, considering the sequence:

- **Option A: Yes** - This suggests that collecting system information comes before checking Internet connectivity.

- **Option B: No** - This suggests that collecting system information does not precede checking Internet connectivity, implying perhaps that connectivity is checked first.

To determine the most plausible sequence, we should consider the typical behavior of malware and attack patterns.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Initial Infiltration**: The malware has just gained access to the target system.

2. **Establishing Connectivity**: One of the first priorities for malware is often to establish a connection back to its C2 servers to receive further instructions or upload stolen data. Therefore, checking Internet connectivity and obtaining the external IP address is crucial before proceeding with data exfiltration or further actions.

3. **Reconnaissance**: Collecting system information like browser history and cached credentials is part of the reconnaissance phase, where the attacker gathers intelligence about the system and its user.

Given this, it is more logical for the malware to first ensure that it can communicate with its C2 servers before proceeding to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data. If the malware collects data before checking connectivity, it risks wasting resources on data collection if it cannot exfiltrate the data due to lack of Internet connectivity.

Therefore, it is more plausible that the 'Wnhttp' module checks Internet connectivity and obtains the external IP address before the 'Recon' module collects system information.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above reasoning, the sequence where connectivity is checked before collecting system information is more logical and efficient for the malware's operation. Hence, the answer is "No," it is not likely that the 'Recon' module will collect initial system information before the 'Wnhttp' module checks Internet connectivity and obtains the external IP address.

**Final Answer: B**
