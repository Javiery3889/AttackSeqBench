To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the sequence makes sense based on known attack patterns, particularly those associated with the Tropic Trooper group.

First, let's break down the sequence of events mentioned in the question:

1. **Equation Editor Exploits**: This refers to vulnerabilities in Microsoft Equation Editor, which is used in Office applications. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system.

2. **Installer Package with Malicious Payloads**: After exploiting the Equation Editor, the attacker delivers an installer package that contains malicious payloads. This suggests that the initial exploit is used to drop further malware onto the system.

3. **FakeRun Loader**: This is likely a custom loader used by the attackers to execute specific processes in a way that evades detection or to set up the environment for the next stage of the attack.

4. **Launch dllhost.exe**: Dllhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used to host in-process COM servers. Attackers might abuse this process to execute their code in the context of a trusted process, making it harder to detect.

5. **Inject Malicious DLL Backdoor**: Finally, the attacker injects a malicious DLL into the dllhost.exe process. This DLL acts as a backdoor, providing the attacker with ongoing access and control over the system.

Now, I need to evaluate whether this sequence is plausible, especially in the context of the Tropic Trooper group's known TTPs.

**Research on Tropic Trooper**:

Tropic Trooper, also known as APT32 or OceanLotus, is a Vietnamese cyber espionage group known for targeting a wide range of industries, including government, technology, and healthcare. They are known for using sophisticated social engineering techniques and exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access to target networks.

Some of their known TTPs include:

- **Phishing Emails**: Often disguised as legitimate communications, these emails contain malicious attachments or links.

- **Exploits**: They have used exploits for various software, including Microsoft Office vulnerabilities.

- **Custom Malware**: Tropic Trooper has developed custom malware tools for espionage purposes.

Given this background, let's see if the sequence described aligns with their modus operandi.

**Analysis of the Sequence**:

1. **Equation Editor Exploits**: This is consistent with Tropic Trooper's use of exploits to gain initial access.

2. **Installer Package with Malicious Payloads**: After gaining initial access, it's common for attackers to drop additional malware onto the system to establish a foothold or to perform more sophisticated actions.

3. **FakeRun Loader**: The use of a custom loader like FakeRun is plausible, as APT groups often develop their own tools to evade detection and perform specific tasks.

4. **Launch dllhost.exe**: Abusing legitimate Windows processes like dllhost.exe is a common technique used by attackers to hide their activities within normal system behavior.

5. **Inject Malicious DLL Backdoor**: Injecting a DLL into a legitimate process is a stealthy way to maintain persistence on a compromised system.

Each step in the sequence seems logical and aligns with known APT tactics. Moreover, the sequence progresses from initial exploitation to establishing persistence, which is a typical pattern for APT attacks.

**Conclusion**:

Given the plausibility of the sequence and its alignment with Tropic Trooper's known TTPs, it is likely that Tropic Trooper would execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe and then inject a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process to facilitate their attack.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
