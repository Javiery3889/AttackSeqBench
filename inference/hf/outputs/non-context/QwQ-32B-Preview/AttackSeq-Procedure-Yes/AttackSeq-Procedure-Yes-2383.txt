To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the sequence makes sense based on my knowledge of malware behavior, specifically TDrop2, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.

2. **Execution:** Using process hollowing to evade detection.

3. **Discovery:** Gathering system information and network views.

The question is whether this sequence is likely for TDrop2 malware.

### Step 1: Understanding TDrop2

TDrop2 is a variant of the TDrop malware family, which is known for its use in cyber espionage campaigns. It is designed to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data from targeted systems.

### Step 2: Initial Access via Spear-Phishing

Spear-phishing is a common initial access vector for many malware families, including those used in targeted attacks. Sending trojanized installation executables via email is a standard technique to trick users into executing malicious code.

### Step 3: Execution using Process Hollowing

Process hollowing is a technique where an attacker creates a new process in a suspended state and then injects malicious code into its memory space before resuming its execution. This technique is used to evade detection because the process appears to be a legitimate executable, but it is actually running malicious code.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, process hollowing falls under the "Execution" tactic, specifically the "Masquerading" sub-technique.

### Step 4: Discovery Activities

After gaining execution, malware often performs discovery activities to gather information about the compromised system and the network it is connected to. This information is crucial for the attacker to understand the environment, identify high-value targets, and plan further steps in the attack chain.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, discovery activities are categorized under the "Discovery" tactic, which includes techniques such as "System Information Discovery" and "Network Service Scanning."

### Step 5: Sequence Plausibility

Now, let's evaluate the sequence:

- **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing with trojanized executables.

- **Execution:** Process hollowing to evade detection.

- **Discovery:** Gathering system and network information.

This sequence is plausible because:

1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing is an effective way to deliver malware to targeted systems.

2. **Execution:** Using process hollowing helps the malware evade detection by security solutions that might monitor for unusual process behavior or known malware signatures.

3. **Discovery:** Once the malware is executing stealthily, it can perform discovery activities to map the environment and plan further actions.

### Step 6: Specifics of TDrop2

To confirm whether TDrop2 specifically uses process hollowing, I would need to refer to threat reports or malware analysis documents related to TDrop2. However, process hollowing is a common technique used by many malware families to evade detection, so it is plausible that TDrop2 uses this technique.

### Step 7: Evaluating Answer Choices

Given the above analysis:

- **Option A: Yes** - This suggests that the sequence is likely for TDrop2.

- **Option B: No** - This suggests that the sequence is not likely for TDrop2.

Based on the plausibility of the sequence and the commonality of process hollowing in malware, especially in targeted attacks, I lean towards Option A.

### Final Answer

\[ \boxed{A} \]
