To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and determine the likelihood of the specified sequence occurring based on typical malware behavior and the information provided.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. The malware executes the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to gather system information.

2. This information is sent to the IP address `45.124.132.127`.

3. The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control (C2) server before contacting the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

Given this sequence, I need to assess the plausibility of the malware performing HTTPS communication with the C2 server prior to contacting `marina-info.net`.

Let's consider the typical sequence of events in a malware attack, especially one that involves communication with a C2 server:

- **Initial Infection:** The malware is introduced to the target system through various vectors such as phishing emails, exploits, etc.

- **Execution and Information Gathering:** Once executed, the malware often gathers information about the compromised system to assess the environment and report back to the C2 server.

- **Communication with C2:** The malware establishes a connection with the C2 server to receive further instructions, upload gathered data, or download additional payloads.

- **Further Operations:** Based on the instructions from the C2 server, the malware may perform various actions, such as spreading to other systems, executing specific attacks, or downloading more tools.

In the scenario provided:

- The malware has already gathered system information using `tasklist` and `systeminfo` commands.

- This information is sent to `45.124.132.127`, which is likely the C2 server.

- The question then asks about the likelihood of establishing HTTPS communication with the C2 server before contacting `marina-info.net`.

Here's where it gets a bit tricky. The information suggests that the malware has already sent data to `45.124.132.127`, which is presumably the C2 server. Now, the question is whether it will establish HTTPS communication with the C2 server before contacting `marina-info.net`.

Let's consider a few points:

1. **Initial Communication:** The malware has already communicated with the C2 server using some protocol to send the system information to `45.124.132.127`. The method of this communication isn't specified, but it's mentioned that the information is sent to this IP.

2. **Subsequent Communication:** The question is about whether the malware will establish HTTPS communication with the C2 server before contacting `marina-info.net`.

Given that the malware has already sent data to the C2 server, it's possible that the next step involves establishing a more secure or different communication channel, such as HTTPS, to receive further instructions or upload more data.

However, the question specifies "before contacting the domain 'marina-info.net' for further operations." This implies that there is a sequence where, after sending system information to the C2 server, the malware may need to perform some action involving `marina-info.net`.

Considering typical malware behavior:

- Malware often has multiple C2 servers or uses different domains for various purposes, such as diversity in communication channels or to bypass blocking mechanisms.

- It's possible that `marina-info.net` is another C2 server or a resource needed for further operations.

- In some cases, malware may need to download additional payloads or modules from specific domains before proceeding with its operations.

Given this context, it's plausible that after sending system information to the primary C2 server (`45.124.132.127`), the malware may need to establish a more secure communication channel (HTTPS) with the C2 server to receive further instructions or download additional components before contacting `marina-info.net`.

Alternatively, the malware might need to contact `marina-info.net` as part of its operational sequence, perhaps to download specific resources or to exfiltrate data.

However, without more specific information about the relationship between the C2 server and `marina-info.net`, it's challenging to determine the exact sequence with certainty.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the information provided and the typical sequence of malware operations, it seems more likely that the malware would establish HTTPS communication with the C2 server to receive instructions or download necessary components before proceeding to contact `marina-info.net` for further operations.

Therefore, the answer is likely A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
