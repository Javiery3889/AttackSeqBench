To answer this question, I need to analyze whether the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described is plausible for an attacker like GOLDBACKDOOR, particularly in the context of a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists.

First, let's break down the sequence:

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing:** This is a common tactic where attackers send targeted emails to specific individuals, often with malicious attachments or links, to gain initial access to a network.

2. **Masquerading a Windows Shortcut File as a Document:** Attackers often use social engineering techniques to trick victims into executing malicious files. Masquerading a shortcut file as a document is a way to make the file appear benign.

3. **Running an Obfuscated PowerShell Script:** Once the shortcut is executed, it runs an obfuscated PowerShell script. Obfuscation is used to evade detection by security software and to make the script's purpose unclear.

4. **Deploying Malware:** The ultimate goal is to deploy malware on the target system.

Now, let's evaluate each part of this sequence:

- **Spear-Phishing Campaign Targeting Journalists:** Journalists often have access to sensitive information and may not be as technically savvy as IT professionals, making them potential targets. It's plausible that GOLDBACKDOOR would target journalists to gain initial access.

- **Masquerading a Windows Shortcut File:** This technique is commonly used in phishing attacks. Shortcut files (with extensions like .lnk) can be designed to look like documents, enticing users to click on them.

- **Obfuscated PowerShell Script:** PowerShell is a powerful scripting language available on Windows systems, making it a popular choice for attackers. Obfuscating the script helps avoid detection by security tools that might look for known malicious patterns.

- **Deploying Malware:** This is the ultimate objective of many cyberattacks. Once initial access is gained, deploying malware can provide persistent access and facilitate further exploitation.

Given that each step in the sequence is a common practice in cyberattacks, particularly those involving targeted spear-phishing, it is plausible that GOLDBACKDOOR would employ this sequence of TTPs.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
