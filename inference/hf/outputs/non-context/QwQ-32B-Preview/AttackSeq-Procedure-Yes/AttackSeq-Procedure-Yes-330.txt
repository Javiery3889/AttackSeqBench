I've got this question here about some backdoor and its tactics. Let's break it down step by step. So, the question is about the "skip-2.0 backdoor" which uses something called "DLL hijacking" to get itself loaded at system startup through the "Windows SessionEnv service." Then, it's supposed to use multiple hooks in "sqllang.dll" to bypass authentication and evade defenses. Finally, its "Inner-Loader" component does process discovery targeting MSSQL Server. The question is asking whether this sequence of actions is likely.

First, I need to understand what each of these terms means and how they fit together in the context of an attack.

1. **Backdoor (skip-2.0):** This sounds like a piece of malware designed to maintain access to a system, often after initial exploitation.

2. **DLL Hijacking:** This is a method where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a location where an application will load it instead of the intended DLL. This can allow the execution of arbitrary code.

3. **Windows SessionEnv service:** I'm not entirely familiar with this specific service, but it seems to be related to session environment variables or something similar. It's likely a service that runs at system startup, which makes it a good target for persistence.

4. **Hooks in sqllang.dll:** Hooking is a technique where an attacker modifies the behavior of functions in a DLL. Sqllang.dll is related to Microsoft SQL Server, so hooking into this DLL could allow the backdoor to interfere with SQL Server operations, potentially to bypass authentication or evade detection.

5. **Inner-Loader component:** This seems to be a part of the backdoor responsible for performing further actions, like process discovery, to find and target specific processes, in this case, MSSQL Server.

Now, let's look at the sequence described:

- Achieve persistence via DLL hijacking through SessionEnv.

- Use multiple hooks in sqllang.dll to bypass authentication and evade defenses.

- Perform process discovery targeting MSSQL Server.

The question is whether this sequence is likely, and we have to choose between "Yes" and "No."

To answer this, I need to consider whether this sequence makes sense from an attacker's perspective and whether it aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

First, using DLL hijacking to achieve persistence is a common tactic. By placing a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate system process, the backdoor can ensure it gets executed at system startup. Targeting the SessionEnv service seems plausible if it loads DLLs in a predictable way.

Next, hooking into sqllang.dll to bypass authentication and evade defenses also makes sense if the attacker's goal is to access or control MSSQL Server. By modifying the behavior of sqllang.dll, the backdoor could potentially intercept authentication attempts or manipulate SQL queries to avoid detection.

Finally, performing process discovery to target MSSQL Server would be a logical step. Attackers often look for specific processes or services to exploit, and MSSQL Server is a valuable target due to the sensitive data it may contain.

Considering these points, the sequence seems plausible. Each step builds upon the previous one to achieve the attacker's objectives.

However, I should also consider whether this sequence is necessary or if there are simpler ways to achieve the same goals. For example, if the backdoor can already run with system privileges through the SessionEnv service, maybe it doesn't need to hook into sqllang.dll to bypass authentication. But hooking into sqllang.dll could provide more stealth and specific capabilities related to SQL Server operations.

Additionally, employing multiple hooks might be a way to ensure that the backdoor can adapt to different versions or configurations of SQL Server, or to cover multiple entry points for greater control.

Given this analysis, it seems likely that the backdoor would employ such a sequence of tactics.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
