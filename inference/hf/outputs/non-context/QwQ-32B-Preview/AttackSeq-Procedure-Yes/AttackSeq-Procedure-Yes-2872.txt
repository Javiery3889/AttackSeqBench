To answer this question, I need to understand the behavior of the malware strains SunBird and Hornbill, particularly focusing on their data handling and exfiltration processes. The question describes a sequence where data is collected, compressed, and stored in hidden folders on external storage. It then asks whether it's likely that these malware strains would exfiltrate this data over C2 channels to their command and control (C2) servers before using the C2 infrastructure to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

First, I need to consider the typical behavior of malware with C2 capabilities. Generally, malware collects data locally, compresses it for efficient transmission, and then exfiltrates it to the C2 servers. The C2 servers are where the threat actors can access and analyze the exfiltrated data. Storing data in hidden folders on external storage suggests that the malware is trying to hide the data locally to avoid detection by the system's users or security software.

Given that, the sequence described—collecting data, compressing it, and storing it in hidden folders—seems like preparatory steps for exfiltration. It's logical that after preparing the data in this manner, the next step would be to exfiltrate it to the C2 servers.

However, the question introduces a slight complexity by mentioning that the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data. This could imply that there might be an intermediate step or another purpose for the C2 infrastructure beyond just receiving the exfiltrated data.

But based on standard malware behavior and the sequence described, it's reasonable to conclude that exfiltration over C2 channels to the C2 servers would occur before any further handling of the data, such as storing or exposing it.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes," it is likely that SunBird and Hornbill will exfiltrate this data over C2 channels to their C2 servers before the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

Final Answer: A
