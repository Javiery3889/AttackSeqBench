To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if protocol tunneling is a likely step during the command and control phase, given the initial discovery phase activities.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Discovery Phase:**
   - Tools used: HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.
   - Activities: Scanning for open ports and shared folders.

These tools are typically used to identify potential entry points into a network. HUC Port Banner Scanner helps in identifying open ports and services running on those ports, while fscan is used for scanning shared folders, which can reveal misconfigured or vulnerable file shares.

2. **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
   - Question asks if Earth Lusca (presumably a threat actor group) will engage in protocol tunneling to establish communication with compromised systems.

Protocol tunneling is a technique where one protocol is encapsulated within another to bypass network restrictions or evade detection. It's a common tactic used in C2 communications to maintain control over compromised systems.

Now, let's consider the likelihood of protocol tunneling being used in this scenario.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Initial Scanning Activities:**
   - The use of port scanners and shared folder scanners suggests that the threat actor is in the early stages of reconnaissance, trying to map the network and find vulnerable entry points.

2. **Compromise of Systems:**
   - Assuming that the threat actor has successfully compromised some systems based on the findings from the discovery phase, the next step would be to establish C2 communications.

3. **Need for C2 Communications:**
   - To maintain control over the compromised systems, the threat actor needs a reliable and stealthy way to communicate with them.

4. **Protocol Tunneling as a Tactic:**
   - Protocol tunneling is a sophisticated technique that can help evade network defenses and maintain persistent access.
   - Many advanced threat groups use tunneling to encapsulate their C2 traffic within allowed protocols like HTTP/S or DNS, making it harder for network security measures to detect malicious activity.

5. **Earth Lusca's TTPs:**
   - While "Earth Lusca" is not a known threat group, assuming it represents a group that employs advanced tactics, it is plausible that they would use protocol tunneling to establish C2 communications.

6. **Alignment with MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists "Protocol Tunneling" under the Command and Control tactics, indicating that it is a recognized technique used by threat actors.

Given this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that, after the discovery phase involving port and shared folder scanning, a threat actor like Earth Lusca would likely employ protocol tunneling in the C2 phase to establish and maintain communication with compromised systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
