To answer this question, I need to analyze the relationship between the actions described in the question and the answer choices provided. The question mentions that the Taidoor malware uses a downloader to decrypt a modified version of itself, and then asks whether this new variant is likely to communicate with specific command-and-control (C2) servers.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. **Malware Behavior**: The Taidoor malware employs a downloader that decrypts a modified version of the malware. This suggests that the malware is attempting to evade detection by using encryption and modifying its code.

2. **Command-and-Control Servers**: The question specifies two C2 servers: roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw. It wants to know if the new variant is likely to communicate with these servers.

Now, let's consider what we know about Taidoor malware and its typical behavior. Taidoor is a type of malware associated with cyber espionage activities, often used to maintain persistent access to compromised systems and exfiltrate data. C2 servers are crucial for malware to receive instructions and transmit stolen data.

Given that the malware is modified and decrypted upon installation, it's plausible that the new variant could have different C2 server addresses to avoid detection or to target specific systems. However, the question doesn't provide any direct information about the C2 servers being used by this particular variant.

To make an informed decision, I need to consider whether there is any indication that these specific servers are related to the described malware activities. The fact that the malware is modified and decrypted doesn't directly imply anything about the C2 servers it will communicate with. The choice of C2 servers is independent of the method used to deploy the malware.

Therefore, without additional information linking the new variant to these specific C2 servers, it's not possible to definitively say whether the new variant will communicate with roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

Given the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

The most appropriate answer is B: No, because there is no direct evidence or logical connection provided in the question that links the new variant's communication to these specific C2 servers based solely on the method of decryption and modification.

**Final Answer: B**
