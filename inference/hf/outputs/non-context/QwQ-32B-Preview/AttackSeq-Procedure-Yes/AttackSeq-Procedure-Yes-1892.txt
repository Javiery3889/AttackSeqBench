So I've got this question here about FIN13's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It's talking about how they use WMI for remote command execution and move laterally using tools like BUSTEDPIPE and Invoke-SMBExec. Then it asks if, after doing all that, they're likely to collect targeted data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and then archive it.

First, I need to understand who FIN13 is. From what I know, FIN13 is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for targeting various industries, including financial institutions, for data theft and espionage. They're known for their sophisticated tactics and careful operational security.

Now, the question is asking about a sequence of actions: after using WMI for remote command execution and moving laterally with tools like BUSTEDPIPE and Invoke-SMBExec, would they collect data from network shared drives, stage it, and then archive it.

Let me break this down.

Step 1: Using WMI for remote command execution.

WMI, or Windows Management Instrumentation, is a core component of the Windows operating system that allows for management and monitoring of system resources. It's a powerful tool for administrators but also for attackers because it can be used to execute commands remotely without needing to install additional software, which can help maintain stealth.

Step 2: Lateral movement using BUSTEDPIPE and Invoke-SMBExec.

BUSTEDPIPE and Invoke-SMBExec are tools or techniques used for moving laterally within a network. Lateral movement is when an attacker moves from the initial compromised system to other systems within the same network to find higher-value targets or to establish a more foothold.

BUSTEDPIPE might be a custom tool or a known technique; I'm not entirely sure without more context, but generally, such names are associated with specific attack methods or tools used by certain APT groups.

Invoke-SMBExec is likely a PowerShell script or function that leverages SMB (Server Message Block) protocols for executing commands on remote systems. SMB is a protocol used for sharing access to resources like files, printers, etc., over a network.

So, after gaining initial access and moving laterally, the next step, according to the question, is to collect targeted data from network shared drives.

This makes sense because once an attacker has traversed the network and gained access to various systems and shares, they would look for valuable data to exfiltrate. Network shared drives are common places where sensitive information is stored, making them prime targets for data theft.

Then, the question mentions staging the collected data locally or remotely before archiving it.

Staging is a process where the collected data is gathered in one place before being exfiltrated out of the network. This can be done for several reasons:

- To consolidate data from multiple sources.

- To compress or encrypt the data to make exfiltration more efficient and stealthy.

- To avoid drawing attention by exfiltrating large amounts of data at once.

Archiving the data would involve organizing and possibly compressing it for easier storage and transport.

Given that FIN13 is an APT group known for data theft, it's highly likely that they would engage in such activities after gaining access and moving laterally within a network.

So, considering all this, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that FIN13 will collect targeted data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and then archive the collected data.

But let's think about possible reasons why it might not be likely.

One possibility is if the network has stringent security measures in place, such as strict access controls, intrusion detection systems, or data loss prevention tools, which could make data collection and staging risky for the attackers.

However, APT groups like FIN13 are known for their ability to bypass such security measures, so this is unlikely to deter them.

Another consideration is the time constraints. If the attackers have limited time before they are detected, they might prioritize certain data over others or expedite the data collection process.

But again, APT groups typically operate with a long-term perspective and take measures to remain undetected for extended periods, so time constraints might not be as pressing.

Furthermore, the question specifies that they have already used WMI for remote command execution and moved laterally using specific tools, which suggests that they have a foothold in the network and have likely already evaded initial defenses.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that their next step would be to search for and collect valuable data, stage it, and archive it for exfiltration.

In conclusion, based on the typical modus operandi of APT groups like FIN13, it is likely that they would engage in the activities described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
