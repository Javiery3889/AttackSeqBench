So I've got this question here about the StellarParticle campaign. It says that the campaign used tools like AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to discover Active Directory information. Then it asks whether it's likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The campaign has already performed discovery activities, which means they've gathered information about the target environment, specifically about Active Directory. Active Directory is central to Windows domain networks, storing information about users, computers, and other resources. Tools like AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets are used to query and extract this information.

So, after gathering this intelligence, the next step for an attacker is usually lateral movementâ€”moving from the initial compromised machine to other parts of the network to find more valuable data or resources. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a common vector for lateral movement because it allows users to log into other computers over the network.

The question is whether the threat actor likely used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP during this lateral movement phase.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, why would an attacker use both types of accounts?

Using privileged accounts obviously gives more access and control over the environment, allowing the attacker to perform administrative tasks, install software, and access sensitive areas. On the other hand, non-privileged accounts might have more limited access but can still be useful for moving laterally, especially if the attacker wants to blend in and avoid detection.

Perhaps the attacker uses non-privileged accounts to move laterally without raising alarms, and then escalates privileges when they reach a machine with more sensitive data.

Also, having multiple accounts with different levels of access can help in maintaining persistence and avoiding locking out any single account, which could alert the defenders.

Moreover, using both types of accounts could be part of a strategy to map out the environment's access controls and to find the path of least resistance to the target data.

Now, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary tactics and techniques, lateral movement is a key tactic. Technique T1021.002 specifically mentions RDP for lateral movement.

In the context of the StellarParticle campaign, if they've already performed discovery activities to map out the AD environment, it makes sense that they would then use that information to move laterally.

But the question is whether they would use both privileged and non-privileged accounts for this purpose.

Let's consider the alternatives.

If they only used privileged accounts, they might get detected more easily, especially if there are monitoring systems in place that watch for administrative logins.

Alternatively, if they only used non-privileged accounts, they might not have enough access to reach the sensitive data they're after.

Therefore, using a combination of both could be the most effective approach.

But is this likely based on the information provided?

The question mentions that the campaign used AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets for discovery. These tools are indeed used for gathering AD information, which is a precursor to lateral movement.

However, the question doesn't provide explicit information about the use of RDP or the types of accounts used for lateral movement.

But given that the campaign has performed discovery and is now moving laterally, it's reasonable to assume that they would use various accounts to achieve their goals.

Moreover, in many real-world scenarios, attackers do use a mix of privileged and non-privileged accounts to navigate the network stealthily and efficiently.

Therefore, option A: Yes, seems plausible.

But let's consider option B: No.

Why might it not be likely that they used both types of accounts?

Perhaps the environment is strictly controlled, and only privileged accounts are allowed for RDP. In that case, the attacker might only need to use privileged accounts.

Alternatively, maybe the attacker has a way to escalate privileges on any machine they log into, making the use of non-privileged accounts unnecessary.

However, without specific information about the target environment's constraints, it's hard to definitively say that using both types of accounts is unlikely.

Given that the question is about likelihood based on the provided information, and considering standard attacker behaviors, using both privileged and non-privileged accounts seems like a reasonable assumption.

Therefore, I think the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
