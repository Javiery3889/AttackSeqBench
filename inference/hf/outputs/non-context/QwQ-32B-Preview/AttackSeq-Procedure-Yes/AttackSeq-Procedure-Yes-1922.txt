To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the proposed sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) is plausible.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** The threat actors are using phishing emails that impersonate the "Tibetan Women's Association" to deliver the FriarFox malicious browser extension.

2. **Subsequent Actions:** After gaining initial access via FriarFox, the question asks if it's likely that the threat actors will use this extension to contact a command and control (C2) server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.

I need to determine whether this sequence of events is plausible based on my knowledge of cyber threat intelligence and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Step 1: Understanding the TTPs Involved**

- **Phishing Emails:** This is a common initial access vector. Threat actors often impersonate trusted entities to trick users into opening malicious attachments or links.

- **Malicious Browser Extension (FriarFox):** This seems to be a specific type of malware designed to exploit browser functionalities for malicious purposes.

- **Command and Control (C2) Communication:** Once a malicious payload is executed, it often communicates with a C2 server to receive further instructions or download additional payloads.

- **Scanbox Payload:** This appears to be another piece of malware that the threat actors aim to deploy on the victim's system.

**Step 2: Evaluating the Plausibility**

I need to assess whether it makes sense for the threat actors to use the FriarFox extension to contact a C2 server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.

- **FriarFox as an Initial Payload:** Malicious browser extensions can have various capabilities, including stealing browser data, injecting malicious scripts into web pages, and even establishing C2 communications.

- **C2 Communication:** It's standard for malware to communicate with C2 servers to receive commands or download additional payloads. This allows threat actors to maintain control over the infected system and adapt their attack strategies dynamically.

- **Retrieving Scanbox Payload:** If FriarFox is capable of C2 communication, it's plausible that it could download and execute additional payloads like Scanbox.

**Step 3: Considering Alternatives**

I should consider whether there are reasons why the threat actors might not follow this sequence.

- **Detection Risks:** Establishing C2 communications can increase the risk of detection if network monitoring tools identify unusual outbound connections.

- **Payload Complexity:** If FriarFox already provides the necessary capabilities, there might be no need to retrieve an additional payload like Scanbox.

However, in many advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios, threat actors use staged infections where initial malware is used to download more sophisticated tools tailored to the target environment.

**Step 4: Referencing MITRE ATT&CK Framework**

The MITRE ATT&CK framework can provide context on common TTPs used by threat actors.

- **Initial Access:** TA0001, which includes techniques like phishing (T1566).

- **Execution:** TA0002, such as executing a malicious file or script.

- **Persistence:** TA0003, though not directly mentioned here.

- **C2:** TA0011, which involves establishing communications with compromised systems.

- **Defense Evasion:** TA0005, which might be relevant if the malware attempts to avoid detection.

- **Command and Control:** Techniques under TA0011, such as using standard application layer protocols (T1071), could be used for C2 communications.

- **Exfiltration:** TA0008, but not directly relevant here.

Given that C2 is a standard part of many attack chains, it's likely that threat actors would use the initial access to establish C2 and download additional payloads.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, it is plausible that after delivering the FriarFox malicious browser extension via phishing emails, the threat actors would use this extension to contact a C2 server and retrieve the Scanbox payload. This aligns with common attack patterns where initial access is used to establish a foothold and download more capabilities.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
