To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the threat actor group FamousSparrow and determine if the described sequence is plausible based on known cyber attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the sequence of events described in the question:

1. **Execution**: FamousSparrow uses `cmd.exe` to execute the SparrowDoor backdoor.

2. **Discovery**: After execution, they collect system information and probe files.

3. **Credential Access**: They dump credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz.

I need to evaluate if this sequence makes sense in the context of a typical cyber attack lifecycle.

### Step 1: Understanding the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes cyber attack tactics and techniques. The main tactics relevant here are Execution, Discovery, and Credential Access.

- **Execution**: This tactic involves techniques used to run malicious code on a target system.

- **Discovery**: This involves actions taken by the attacker to understand the target environment, such as gathering information about the system and network.

- **Credential Access**: This tactic focuses on obtaining credentials to gain deeper access or maintain persistence.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence

Let's look at the sequence provided:

1. **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to execute SparrowDoor backdoor.

   - This is a common technique. Attackers often use legitimate tools like `cmd.exe` to execute malicious payloads to blend in with normal system behavior.

2. **Discovery**: Collecting system information and probing files.

   - After gaining execution, attackers typically perform discovery to understand the environment, identify valuable data, and plan further steps.

3. **Credential Access**: Dumping credentials using a custom Mimikatz.

   - Once the attacker has a foothold and understands the environment, they may attempt to escalate privileges or move laterally by accessing credentials.

### Step 3: Evaluating Plausibility

Is this sequence plausible?

- **Execution followed by Discovery**: Yes, this is standard. Attackers need to understand the environment after gaining initial access.

- **Discovery followed by Credential Access**: Yes, discovering the environment often leads to identifying targets for credential harvesting.

- Using a custom version of Mimikatz for credential dumping is also plausible, as attackers frequently modify tools to evade detection.

### Step 4: Considering Alternatives

Let's consider if there are any missing steps or if the sequence could be different.

- Some attacks might include persistence mechanisms between discovery and credential access, but this isn't necessarily always the case.

- The sequence provided seems logical and aligns with many observed attack patterns.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
