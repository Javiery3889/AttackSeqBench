To answer this question, I need to consider the behavior of malware like XAgent on iOS devices and how it might operate within the constraints of the iOS environment, especially on iOS 7.

First, let's understand what XAgent is. XAgent is a type of malware that targets iOS devices. It's known for its ability to hide its icon and run in the background, which makes it difficult for users to detect its presence. This kind of behavior is typical for malware aiming to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

Now, the question is asking whether, after executing and hiding its icon, the app is likely to collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 (command and control) server.

Let's break this down:

1. **Hiding Icon and Running in Background:** This is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection. On iOS, apps can run in the background, but there are limitations imposed by the operating system to preserve battery life and system resources.

2. **Collecting List of Processes:** Collecting a list of running processes can be useful for malware to understand the environment it's operating in. This information can help the malware avoid interfering with other critical processes or to identify other potential targets or vulnerabilities.

3. **Sending Information via HTTP to C2 Server:** Exfiltrating data to a C2 server is a standard procedure for malware to report back to its operators, receive further instructions, or upload stolen data.

Given that XAgent is a malware designed to be stealthy and operate undetected, it would make sense for it to collect information about the device's state, including running processes, to better adapt its behavior and avoid detection. Additionally, sending this information back to the operators would allow them to understand the environment and potentially tailor further attacks.

However, I need to consider the feasibility of collecting process lists on iOS 7. iOS is a closed ecosystem with strict permissions and sandboxing mechanisms. Apps are generally not allowed to access information about other apps or the system processes without explicit permissions, which are rarely granted to third-party apps.

But, if XAgent has managed to bypass these security measures, perhaps through a vulnerability or by being signed with a trusted certificate, it might be possible for it to collect such information.

Moreover, exfiltrating data via HTTP is a common method, but modern iOS versions have various security features like encryption and anomaly detection that might flag such activities.

Considering all this, the answer seems to be "Yes," it is likely that the app will collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A}} \]
