To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and evaluate whether they align with typical behaviors of the BlackEnergy malware, especially focusing on persistence mechanisms and command and control (C&C) communications.

First, let's break down the sequence of events mentioned in the question:

1. **Execution of BlackEnergy dropper via malicious Word document's VBA macro:**
   - BlackEnergy is known to be distributed through phishing emails containing malicious attachments, often Word documents with malicious VBA macros. So, this initial infection vector is plausible.

2. **Ensuring persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder:**
   - Malware often employs various persistence mechanisms to ensure they continue to run across system reboots. Using a LNK file in the startup folder is one such method. LNK files can be used to silently execute commands or launch malware.

3. **Using the LNK file to execute a command before connecting to the hardcoded C&C server:**
   - After establishing persistence, malware typically seeks to communicate with its C&C server to receive further instructions or download additional payloads.

Now, let's evaluate each part of this sequence in the context of BlackEnergy's known behaviors.

**BlackEnergy and VBA Macros:**
- BlackEnergy is indeed known to utilize malicious Office documents with embedded VBA macros for initial infection. These macros are designed to download and execute the BlackEnergy dropper.

**Persistence Mechanisms:**
- BlackEnergy has been observed using various persistence techniques, including modifying registry keys, creating scheduled tasks, and placing executable files in startup folders.
- Using LNK files in the startup folder is a plausible method, as it can help maintain stealth while ensuring the malware runs at system startup.

**Communication with C&C Server:**
- Once installed, BlackEnergy establishes a connection to a C&C server to receive commands or download additional modules.
- The C&C server address is often hardcoded into the malware or retrieved from a configuration file.

Given this information, the sequence described in the question seems consistent with BlackEnergy's known modus operandi.

However, to make a more informed decision, let's consider if there are any specific indicators or behaviors that might suggest this sequence is less likely.

**Potential Considerations:**
- Variability in malware behavior: Malware authors often change their tactics to evade detection, so while a certain behavior is typical, variations can occur.
- Specific strain or variant: Different strains of BlackEnergy might employ different persistence mechanisms.

Despite these considerations, the sequence described aligns well with established knowledge about BlackEnergy's infection and persistence strategies.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes," it is plausible that BlackEnergy would ensure its persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder and using it to execute a command before connecting to a hardcoded C&C server.

**Final Answer: A**
