So I've got this question here about Yellow Garuda and their activities related to Telegram data. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

First off, Yellow Garuda is mentioned as collecting various types of data from victims' Telegram accounts. This includes messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. They're using something called a Telegram 'grabber' tool to do this. So, it sounds like this tool is designed to harvest or capture data from Telegram accounts.

The question is asking whether it's likely that after collecting this data, Yellow Garuda exfiltrates it over the web and stores it in SQLite database and JSON format.

Okay, so I need to think about whether this sequence of actions makes sense based on what I know about such scenarios.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the collection of data using a grabber tool. If this tool is designed to collect data from Telegram accounts, it probably interacts with Telegram's API or perhaps somehow captures data from the client-side of the application.

Now, once this data is collected, the next step is exfiltration over the web. Exfiltration means transferring the data from the victim's device to another location, likely controlled by the attackers. Using the web for this purpose is common because most devices have internet access, and it's a convenient way to send data out.

So, it makes sense that the data would be exfiltrated over the web.

Now, regarding the storage formats: SQLite database and JSON format.

SQLite is a lightweight database management system that's embedded into applications. It's widely used for storing structured data in a local database. JSON, on the other hand, is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate.

Both formats are commonly used for storing and transmitting data, so it's plausible that the collected data is stored in these formats.

But let's think about why they might choose these specific formats.

SQLite is useful for organizing and querying data locally, especially if the attackers need to perform complex searches or analyses on the collected data. JSON, being a text-based format, is easy to transmit over the web and can be parsed by various programming languages.

So, using both formats could make sense: perhaps the data is first stored in an SQLite database for local management and then exported in JSON format for transmission over the web.

Alternatively, the grabber tool might collect the data and store it in JSON format directly, then send it over the web to a server where it's imported into an SQLite database for further processing.

Either way, both formats are reasonable choices for handling the types of data being collected.

Now, looking back at the question, it's asking if it's likely that these data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

Given that exfiltration over the web is a common practice and that both SQLite and JSON are widely used formats for data storage and transmission, it does seem likely.

But, to be thorough, I should consider any factors that might make this unlikely.

For example, if there were specific constraints or indicators that suggest a different method of data handling, that might affect the likelihood.

However, based on the information provided in the question, there's no indication of any such constraints.

Therefore, in the absence of any contradicting information, it's reasonable to assume that the data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

So, considering all this, I think the answer is "Yes," which corresponds to option A.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
