To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the context provided in the question. It mentions that a backdoor function has been used to collect machine information and take screenshots during the Discovery and Collection tactics. This suggests that an attacker has already gained access to a target system and is now gathering information about it.

The question then asks whether, during the Command and Control (C2) phase, this backdoor is likely to communicate with the Command and Control server via an encrypted channel.

Let's recall what the Command and Control phase entails in the context of cyber attacks. During this phase, the attacker maintains control over the compromised system and issues commands to it, often receiving feedback or exfiltrating data. Communication between the compromised system and the C2 server is crucial for the attacker to manage the infection and extract valuable information.

Now, considering that the backdoor has already been used for discovery and collection, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker wants to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the communications during the C2 phase. Using an encrypted channel would help achieve this by preventing detection and interception of the communications by network security measures or other parties.

Moreover, in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversarial tactics and techniques, there is a technique called "Encrypted Channel" under the Command and Control tactic. This technique involves the use of encryption to conceal the content of C2 communications, making it harder for defenders to detect or interfere with the communication.

Given this information, it's logical to conclude that an attacker would prefer to use an encrypted channel for C2 communications to avoid detection and ensure the success of their operations.

Therefore, the answer to the question is likely "Yes," the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

**Final Answer: A**
