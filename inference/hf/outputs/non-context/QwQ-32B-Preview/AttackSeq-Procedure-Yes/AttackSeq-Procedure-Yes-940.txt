To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the sequence makes sense based on my knowledge of the Sednit group's modus operandi and general cybersecurity practices.

First, let's break down the sequence of events mentioned in the question:

1. **Initial Access via Spearphishing Emails with Zebrocy Components:**
   - Zebrocy is a malware strain associated with the Sednit group, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, or Sofacy. It's commonly used for initial access through spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments or links.

2. **Stage-1 Downloader:**
   - After gaining initial access, threat actors often use a stage-1 downloader to fetch additional payloads. This is a common technique to avoid detection and to maintain flexibility in delivering various types of malware.

3. **Download and Execute a New Downloader:**
   - The stage-1 downloader might download another downloader, possibly to add an extra layer of obfuscation or to access more resources.

4. **COM Object Hijacking for Persistence:**
   - For persistence, the attackers might use COM object hijacking, which involves modifying the registry to execute their malicious code when certain COM objects are instantiated.

5. **Adding Custom Registry Keys:**
   - Part of the persistence mechanism involves adding custom registry keys that point to the malicious binaries.

Now, let's evaluate if this sequence is plausible based on known Sednit group tactics and general attack patterns.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Initial Access:**
   - It's well-documented that the Sednit group uses spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver Zebrocy malware. So, the initial access vector makes sense.

2. **Stage-1 Downloader:**
   - Once the initial payload (Zebrocy) is executed, it's typical for malware to download additional tools or payloads. A stage-1 downloader is a standard technique in this phase.

3. **Download and Execute a New Downloader:**
   - Sometimes, attackers use multiple layers of downloaders to evade detection and to have more control over the infection chain. This additional layer isn't uncommon, but it depends on the specific campaign and target.

4. **COM Object Hijacking for Persistence:**
   - Persistence mechanisms are crucial for maintaining long-term access to a compromised system. COM object hijacking is a sophisticated method that can be effective, as it leverages legitimate system processes.

5. **Adding Custom Registry Keys:**
   - Modifying registry keys is a common way to achieve persistence. By placing pointers to malicious binaries in the registry, the malware can be executed at system startup or when specific events occur.

**Alignment with Known TTPs:**

- The Sednit group is known for using multi-stage attacks with various downloaders and persistence mechanisms. COM object hijacking is a technique that aligns with their advanced capabilities.

**Potential Variations:**

- While this sequence is plausible, it's also possible that the group might use different techniques for persistence, such as creating scheduled tasks, modifying startup items, or using other registry keys.

**Conclusion:**

Given the sequence described—initial access via spearphishing with Zebrocy, followed by a stage-1 downloader, then another downloader, and finally COM object hijacking with custom registry keys for persistence—it is likely that this sequence accurately represents the Sednit group's operations in certain scenarios.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
