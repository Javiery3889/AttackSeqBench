So I've got this question here about a backdoor used by this group called Dropping Elephant. It says that this backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials and other data. Then, it asks if it's likely that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server. The answer choices are just "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand what's being asked. There's a backdoor used by Dropping Elephant, which is probably a threat actor group. This backdoor steals Chrome credentials and other data. Now, there's a file-stealer module, and the question is whether it's likely that this module will go through directories, look for files with specific extensions, and upload them to the command and control (C2) server.

I need to think about what typical file-stealing malware does. Generally, file stealers are designed to look for specific types of files that are valuable to the attackers. These could be documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, etc. So, it makes sense that a file-stealer module would iterate through directories to find files with certain extensions that are of interest.

Moreover, if the backdoor has already stolen Chrome credentials and other data, it's likely that the attackers are interested in as much sensitive information as possible. So, collecting files with specific extensions is a logical next step.

Also, considering that the backdoor is used by a threat actor group, it's probable that they have developed or used a file-stealer module that is efficient and targeted. Iterating through directories and selecting files based on extensions is a common technique used by such modules.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that yes, it is likely that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server.

So, my answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
