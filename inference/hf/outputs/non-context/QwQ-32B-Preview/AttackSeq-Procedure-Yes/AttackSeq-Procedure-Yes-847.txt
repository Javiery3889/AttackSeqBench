To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the context provided. The question is about the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers during a cyber attack, specifically in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The scenario described involves attackers who have已完成 discovery phase, meaning they have gathered information about the target environment, including systems, users, and data relevant to their objectives.

The question then asks whether, after this discovery phase, it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

Let's clarify some key terms here:

1. **Discovery Phase**: This is part of the initial reconnaissance where attackers gather as much information as possible about the target environment. This includes mapping the network, identifying users, understanding data flows, and more.

2. **Lateral Movement**: This refers to the technique attackers use to move within a network from the initial point of entry to their ultimate target. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to access other systems.

3. **Persistence**: This is the technique attackers use to maintain access to the target environment, even if they are detected or if systems are restarted. Persistence mechanisms can include modifying system configurations, creating backdoors, or using legitimate administrative tools.

Now, considering the sequence mentioned in the question: exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

We need to evaluate whether this sequence is likely based on our understanding of attacker behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, lateral movement and persistence are both part of the post-exploitation phase. Attackers typically aim to establish persistence early in the attack chain to ensure they can maintain access as they conduct further activities.

However, the sequence suggested in the question is to perform lateral movement first, followed by establishing persistence on the new systems accessed.

Is this a plausible sequence?

Well, in many attack scenarios, attackers do perform lateral movement to access more systems that are closer to their target or to spread their footprint in the network. During this process, they may establish persistence on each new system they access to ensure they can continue their operations without interruption.

So, from that perspective, it makes sense that after gaining access to a new system via lateral movement, the next step would be to establish persistence on that system.

But, is this always the case? Do attackers always establish persistence immediately after lateral movement?

Not necessarily. The sequence can vary based on the attacker's objectives, the specific tactics they are employing, and the defenses they are up against.

For example, in some scenarios, attackers might prioritize completing their mission objectives quickly and may not have time to establish persistence on every system they access. In such cases, they might focus on moving laterally to reach their target without spending extra time on persistence.

Alternatively, in more patient and sophisticated attacks, attackers might take the time to establish persistence on each system they access to ensure they can come back to it later if needed.

Moreover, some persistence techniques can be established before or during the lateral movement process. For example, using pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket techniques for lateral movement can also provide a form of persistence.

Given this variability, it's important to consider the specific context of the attack described in the question.

The question mentions that attackers have已完成 the discovery phase and are moving on to exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points.

Given that they have already gathered detailed information about the environment, it's reasonable to assume that they would methodically move through the network, accessing systems step by step and establishing persistence as they go.

Therefore, the sequence of exploiting remote services for lateral movement followed by installing persistence on the new systems seems plausible.

But, to make a more informed decision, let's consider the answer choices provided:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the reasoning above, it seems likely that attackers would follow this sequence. Therefore, answer choice A: Yes, appears to be the correct choice.

However, to ensure there are no overlooked factors, let's consider if there are any scenarios where this sequence might not hold.

For instance, if the attackers are in a hurry to achieve their objectives quickly and do not have time to establish persistence on each system, they might prioritize speed over maintaining long-term access. In such cases, they might perform lateral movement without immediately establishing persistence.

Additionally, if the attackers have already established persistence mechanisms earlier in the attack chain, they might not need to set up additional persistence points on every new system they access.

Furthermore, some persistence techniques might be established as part of the lateral movement process, blurring the lines between these two activities.

Despite these possible variations, in general, it is common for attackers to establish persistence on systems they access to ensure they can maintain their foothold in the environment.

Therefore, considering the typical attacker behavior and the sequence described in the question, it is likely that attackers would exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

Hence, the answer should be A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
