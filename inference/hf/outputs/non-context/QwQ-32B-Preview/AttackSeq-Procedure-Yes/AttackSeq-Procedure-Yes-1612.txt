To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the deployment of Hermes ransomware follows logically from the established activities of the Lazarus group.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Actor Identification**: The Lazarus group is identified as the threat actor. Lazarus is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group known for a wide range of cyber activities, including espionage, cyber warfare, and financial gain through ransomware attacks.

2. **Established Command and Control (C&C) Communication**: The group has already established C&C communication using backdoor malware (specifically samples #4 and #6). These backdoors are used to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.

3. **Proposed Action**: The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus group would then deploy Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leave ransom notes in encrypted directories.

To evaluate this, I need to consider the typical behavior and known TTPs of the Lazarus group, as well as the plausibility of deploying ransomware after gaining access and establishing C&C communication.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Lazarus Group Capabilities and Objectives**:
   - Lazarus is known for diverse objectives, including espionage, disruption, and financial gain.
   - They have been involved in various high-profile attacks, such as the Sony Pictures hack and the Bangladesh Bank heist.
   - While ransomware is not their primary tool, they have been associated with ransomware activities, including the use of Hermes ransomware.

2. **Establishing C&C Communication**:
   - Backdoors like those mentioned (samples #4 and #6) are common in initial access and persistence phases of an attack.
   - Polling remote C&C servers for tasks and executing commands is standard operational procedure for maintaining control over compromised systems.

3. **Deployment of Ransomware**:
   - After gaining access and establishing persistence, deploying ransomware can be a logical next step for financially motivated attackers.
   - Encrypting files and demanding ransom is a direct way to monetize the access they have gained.

4. **Hermes Ransomware**:
   - Hermes is a known ransomware variant that has been attributed to the Lazarus group.
   - It encrypts files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm, which matches the description in the question.
   - Leaving ransom notes in encrypted directories is a standard practice for ransomware operators to instruct victims on how to pay the ransom and potentially decrypt their files.

5. **Plausibility**:
   - Given that Lazarus has used Hermes ransomware in the past, and the description matches known characteristics of Hermes, it is plausible that they would deploy Hermes after establishing C&C communication.
   - The sequence of actions—gaining access, establishing persistence, and then deploying ransomware—is a common pattern in ransomware attacks.

6. **Alternative Considerations**:
   - While Lazarus is known for various types of attacks, including those not related to ransomware, the specific activities described align with ransomware deployment.
   - However, it's essential to consider that other groups may also use similar TTPs, but the question specifies the Lazarus group.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, it is likely that after establishing C&C communication using backdoor malware, the Lazarus group would deploy Hermes ransomware to encrypt files and leave ransom notes, as described. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
