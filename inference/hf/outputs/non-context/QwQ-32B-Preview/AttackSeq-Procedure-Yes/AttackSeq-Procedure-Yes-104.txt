I'm going to tackle this question about Waterbear's backdoor configuration. So, the question is: after using API hooking techniques to evade detection by modifying certain functions in memory, is it likely that Waterbear's backdoor configuration will include an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address for its communication with external entities? The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. Waterbear seems to be some kind of malware, likely a backdoor, which is using API hooking to evade detection. API hooking is a technique where malware intercepts and modifies the behavior of functions in a program's API, in this case, modifying functions like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.

So, the malware is trying to hide its activities by altering how these functions work. 'ZwOpenProcess' is related to process manipulation, and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' is used for retrieving TCP connection information. By hooking these, the malware might be trying to hide its own processes or network activities.

Now, the question is asking whether, given this behavior, it's likely that the backdoor's configuration includes an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address.

Let's break this down:

1. **Encryption/Decryption Key:** Malware often uses encryption to protect its communications with its command and control (C&C) servers. This helps to hide the content of the messages from network monitoring tools and makes it harder for defenders to intercept and understand the data being exchanged.

2. **XOR-Encrypted C&C Server Address:** XOR encryption is a simple form of encryption where each byte of the data is XORed with a key byte. It's not very secure by modern standards, but it can be effective for basic obfuscation, especially in the context of malware trying to hide its C&C server addresses from simple string searches or network analysis.

Given that the malware is already employing API hooking to evade detection, it's reasonable to assume that it would also take steps to protect its communications. Here's why:

- **Evasion Techniques:** Malware that uses advanced evasion techniques like API hooking is likely to employ multiple layers of protection to remain undetected. Encryption of communications is a common practice among malware authors to avoid detection and analysis.

- **Data Protection:** Encrypting the backdoor configuration, including the C&C server address, helps prevent static analysis by security researchers. If the C&C address is hardcoded and not encrypted, it's easier for defenders to find and block it.

- **Flexibility:** Using an encryption/decryption key allows the malware to dynamically generate or resolve the C&C server address at runtime, making it harder for defenders to track and disrupt the malware's command and control infrastructure.

Considering these points, it seems plausible that Waterbear's backdoor configuration would include an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address.

However, I should also consider whether there might be reasons why this might not be the case. For example:

- **Simplicity:** Some malware might opt for simpler obfuscation techniques and not use encryption for their communications, especially if they target less security-conscious environments.

- **Resource Constraints:** Encryption can be computationally expensive, and malware authors might choose to avoid it if their targets have limited computing resources.

But given that the malware is already using API hooking, which is a more sophisticated technique, it's likely that the authors are willing to invest in additional layers of protection.

Moreover, the specific mention of XOR encryption for the C&C server address suggests a balance between obfuscation and performance. XOR is a lightweight encryption method that won't significantly impact the malware's performance but can still hinder simple analysis attempts.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the common practices of malware authors, it's reasonable to expect that Waterbear's backdoor configuration includes an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
