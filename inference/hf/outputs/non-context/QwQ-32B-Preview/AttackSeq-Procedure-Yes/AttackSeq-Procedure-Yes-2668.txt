To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the actions attributed to the OceanLotus backdoor are plausible based on known behaviors and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Persistence Mechanism:**
   - The backdoor creates a Launch Agent.
   - It copies itself to specific locations based on the user's UID:
     - `~/Library/OpenSSL/` for user-specific persistence.
     - `/Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs` for system-wide persistence.

2. **Subsequent Actions:**
   - Survey the victim's computer to gather system information.
   - Send encrypted details about this system information to its command and control (C2) server.

I need to evaluate whether these actions are likely for the OceanLotus backdoor.

### Step 1: Understanding OceanLotus

OceanLotus, also known as APT32, is a Vietnamese cyber espionage group. They are known for using various malware families, including backdoors, to target entities in Southeast Asia and other regions.

### Step 2: Analyzing Persistence Techniques

The described persistence mechanisms involve creating Launch Agents and copying the backdoor to specific directories:

- **Launch Agent:** This is a common technique used in macOS for achieving persistence. By placing a property list (plist) file in the `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` or `/Library/LaunchAgents/` directory, the backdoor can be automatically launched at user login or system startup.

- **Locations:**
  - `~/Library/OpenSSL/`: This path suggests user-specific persistence, as it is within the user's home directory.
  - `/Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs`: This path suggests system-wide persistence, as it is in the system library directory.

These techniques align with known persistence methods in macOS, as documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under T1547.011 (Create or Modify System Process: Launch Daemon / Agent).

### Step 3: Surveying the Victim's Computer

After establishing persistence, it is common for backdoors to gather information about the compromised system. This information can be used to:

- Determine the system's configuration and capabilities.
- Identify if the system is of interest for further exploitation.
- Gather data for exfiltration.

Techniques for surveying the system include:

- Enumerating system information (e.g., OS version, installed software).
- Gathering network configuration details.
- Collecting information about user accounts and privileges.

This behavior is consistent with the Reconnaissance phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly under T1087 (Account Discovery), T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery), and T1049 (System Information Discovery).

### Step 4: Communicating with C2 Server

Sending gathered information to a C2 server is a standard procedure for backdoors. To evade detection, this communication is often encrypted to prevent analysis by network security tools.

Encryption methods can include:

- Using established protocols like HTTPS.
- Implementing custom encryption algorithms.

This activity corresponds to the Command and Control phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) and T1573.001 (Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography).

### Step 5: Evaluating Plausibility

Given the above analysis:

- The persistence mechanisms described are consistent with known techniques used in macOS.
- Surveying the system for information is a standard procedure for backdoors.
- Encrypting communication with the C2 server is a common practice to avoid detection.

Therefore, it is plausible that the OceanLotus backdoor would perform these actions after achieving persistence.

### Final Answer

A: Yes
