I have this question here about APT10's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that APT10 has staged data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts. So, they've gathered the data they want to steal, compressed it into multiple parts, and used scripts to execute commands remotely to do this.

Now, it's asking whether, after doing this, it's likely that APT10 will use dynamic-DNS domains for their command and control (C2) infrastructure, and in doing so, employ tools like Robocopy and PuTTY Secure Copy Client (PSCP).

Let's consider each part of this.

First, dynamic-DNS domains for C2: Dynamic DNS is often used by attackers because it allows them to maintain a consistent domain name that points to a changing IP address. This can help them evade IP-based blocking and make their C2 servers more resilient to takedown attempts. So, using dynamic-DNS for C2 makes sense from an APT perspective.

Next, tools like Robocopy and PSCP: Robocopy is a file-copying utility that comes with Windows, and PSCP is a secure copy tool that uses SSH for secure file transfers. Both of these are legitimate tools that can be used for legitimate purposes but can also be abused by attackers for their operations.

Now, the question is whether it's likely that APT10 will use these tools in conjunction with dynamic-DNS for C2 after staging the data.

To answer this, I need to think about the sequence of events and whether these tools fit into that sequence.

First, APT10 has already staged the data for exfiltration. That means they've collected the data they want and prepared it for transfer out of the network.

Now, for exfiltration, they need to get this data out of the compromised network and back to their command and control servers.

Using tools like Robocopy and PSCP could be part of this exfiltration process. Robocopy can be used to copy the staged data to a location from which it can be exfiltrated, and PSCP can be used to securely transfer that data over the network.

However, the question is specifically about using these tools in conjunction with dynamic-DNS domains for C2.

So, dynamic-DNS would be used to resolve the domain name of their C2 server to the current IP address, allowing for a consistent communication channel.

Now, whether APT10 is likely to use these specific tools depends on their known TTPs.

I need to recall what's known about APT10's tools and procedures.

From my knowledge of APT10, they are known to use a variety of custom and off-the-shelf tools. They have been observed using tools like ChinaChopper, a web shell, and other custom backdoors.

Regarding data exfiltration, they have used compressed archives and have employed remote command execution scripts, which aligns with the first part of the question.

Now, about Robocopy and PSCP: Robocopy is a native Windows tool, so using it would provide APT10 with operational stealth, as it's part of the operating system and its use might not raise immediate alarms.

PSCP, on the other hand, is a third-party tool that would need to be deployed on the target system, which could potentially raise red flags if detected.

However, APT groups often use a combination of native and third-party tools to balance between stealth and functionality.

Given that APT10 has been known to use remote command execution scripts, it's plausible that they would use Robocopy as part of their data staging and exfiltration process.

As for PSCP, while it's a secure copy tool, APT groups often prefer to use their own custom tools or other methods for exfiltration to avoid detection.

Moreover, using dynamic-DNS for C2 is a common tactic among APT groups to maintain control over their compromised systems and to exfiltrate data.

So, putting it all together: after staging data using compression tools and remote scripts, it's plausible that APT10 would use dynamic-DNS for their C2 infrastructure.

Whether they specifically use Robocopy and PSCP for this purpose is a bit more nuanced.

Robocopy is likely, given its availability and functionality, but PSCP might be less likely unless they have a specific need for SSH-based exfiltration.

However, the question is about the likelihood, and given that these tools can be used for the purposes described, it's possible.

But is it likely?

Considering that APT10 has been known to use a variety of tools and techniques, including both custom and off-the-shelf solutions, using Robocopy and PSCP in conjunction with dynamic-DNS for C2 seems plausible.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

But let's consider the alternative.

If I choose "No," I need to have a good reason why it's unlikely.

One possible reason could be that APT10 prefers to use their own custom tools for exfiltration to avoid detection or to have more control over the exfiltration process.

However, given that they have been observed using native Windows tools and other third-party tools, the use of Robocopy and PSCP doesn't seem out of character.

Moreover, using dynamic-DNS for C2 is a standard practice in the APT world to maintain resilience and evade network defenses.

Therefore, the "Yes" answer seems more aligned with their known TTPs and the scenario described.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the known behaviors of APT10, it is likely that they would use dynamic-DNS domains for their C2 infrastructure and employ tools like Robocopy and PSCP in the process.
