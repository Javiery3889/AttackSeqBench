To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the Higaisa APT group and determine if the described actions align with their known behavior.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** The Higaisa APT group is using malicious LNK files disguised as Curriculum Vitae (CVs) and IELTS exam results for initial access.

2. **Execution and Evasion:** They are executing multiple commands leveraging 'gosia.exe' to bypass detection.

3. **Persistence:** They maintain persistence by copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

I need to evaluate whether this sequence of TTPs is likely for the Higaisa APT group.

**Step 1: Research on Higaisa APT Group**

Higaisa, also known as Zebrocy, is a cyber espionage group primarily associated with targeting diplomatic and government organizations in Europe and Asia. They are known for using various malware families and employing social engineering tactics to gain initial access to target networks.

**Step 2: Initial Access Vector**

The use of malicious LNK files disguised as CVs and IELTS exam results is consistent with Higaisa's modus operandi. They often use phishing emails with attachments that appear legitimate to trick users into executing malicious code.

**Step 3: Execution and Evasion Techniques**

The mention of 'gosia.exe' is interesting. Upon research, 'gosia.exe' appears to be a component associated with the Higaisa group, specifically used for executing commands and potentially evading detection. If Higaisa is using 'gosia.exe' to execute multiple commands and bypass detection, this aligns with their known tactics for establishing a foothold and maintaining stealth.

**Step 4: Persistence Mechanisms**

Higaisa is known to employ various persistence mechanisms, including modifying registry keys, creating scheduled tasks, and copying malicious files to startup directories. The actions described—copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks—are typical methods used by APT groups to ensure their malware persists across system reboots.

**Step 5: Cross-Referencing with MITRE ATT&CK Framework**

To further validate this sequence, I can map these TTPs to the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

- **Initial Access:** Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)

- **Execution:** Executable Files (T1106), Signed Binary Proxy Execution (T1216)

- **Persistence:** Windows Service (T1543), Scheduled Task/Job (T1053), Create or Modify System Process (T1543)

- **Evasion:** Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027), Indicator Removal on Host (T1070)

Given that Higaisa is known to use these techniques, the sequence described in the question seems plausible.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

Based on the analysis of Higaisa's known TTPs and the alignment with the described sequence of actions, it is likely that the Higaisa APT group would execute multiple commands leveraging 'gosia.exe' to bypass detection and maintain persistence by copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
