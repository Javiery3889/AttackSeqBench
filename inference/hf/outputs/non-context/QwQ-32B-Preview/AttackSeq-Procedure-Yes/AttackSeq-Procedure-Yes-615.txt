To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question describes a VBS script that has been obfuscated for defense evasion and is configured to delete itself after execution. Then, it asks whether it's likely that this script will communicate with a C&C server at a specific URL.

Let's consider each part:

1. **Obfuscation for Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation is a technique used to make code harder to understand, often to evade detection by security tools. This is a common tactic used by malware to avoid being caught by antivirus software or other security measures.

2. **Self-Deletion Post-Execution:** Configuring the script to delete itself after running is another evasion technique. This aims to remove traces of the malicious activity from the system, making it harder for incident responders to analyze the threat after the fact.

3. **Communication with a C&C Server:** The question specifies a particular URL for a C&C server. C&C servers are used by malware to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The presence of such communication is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

Now, considering these points, we need to determine if it's likely that this VBS script will communicate with the specified C&C server.

**Analysis:**

- **Obfuscation and Self-Deletion:** These are both tactics typically employed by malware to evade detection and analysis. Obfuscation makes it harder for security tools to inspect the code, while self-deletion removes evidence after the script has run.

- **C&C Communication:** Malware often needs to communicate with a C&C server to receive instructions, upload stolen data, or download additional payloads. This communication is crucial for the malware's functionality.

Given that the script is using evasion techniques, it's reasonable to suspect that it may also attempt to communicate with a C&C server to fulfill its malicious objectives.

However, the question is whether it's "likely" that it will communicate with the specific C&C server mentioned.

**Considerations:**

- **Likelihood of C&C Communication:** Given that the script is employing evasion techniques, it's plausible that it is malware and may attempt to communicate with a C&C server.

- **Specific URL:** The URL provided is quite specific, including a placeholder for the computer name and a hexadecimal value. This suggests that the C&C server is set up to receive communications from multiple compromised machines, each identified by their computer name and some unique identifier.

- **VBS Script Capabilities:** VBS (Visual Basic Script) is a scripting language that can perform various tasks, including network communications. It's possible for a VBS script to make HTTP requests to a C&C server.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the script is using obfuscation and self-deletion techniques, which are common in malware, and considering that communication with a C&C server is a typical behavior for malware, it is likely that this VBS script will attempt to communicate with the specified C&C server.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
