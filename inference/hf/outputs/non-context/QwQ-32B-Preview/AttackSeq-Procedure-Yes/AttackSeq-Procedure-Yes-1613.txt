I've got this question here about the Lazarus group and their activities, specifically regarding the use of backdoor malware and subsequent deployment of Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files. The question is whether it's likely that they would do this during a bank heist. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand who the Lazarus group is. From my knowledge, Lazarus is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group known for a variety of cyber attacks, including high-profile incidents like the Sony Pictures hack and the Bangladesh Bank heist. They are versatile and have been involved in everything from espionage to financial theft.

Now, the question mentions that they used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands. This sounds like a standard initial step in many cyber attacks. Backdoors allow persistent access to a compromised system, which is crucial for attackers to maintain control and carry out further activities without being detected.

Next, it talks about deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files. Hermes is indeed a ransomware variant that has been associated with the Lazarus group. Ransomware is typically used to encrypt files and demand a ransom for the decryption key, but in this case, the focus seems to be on deleting backups rather than just encrypting files.

The question is whether it's likely that they would do this during a bank heist. A bank heist in this context probably refers to a cyber attack aimed at stealing money from a bank's systems. So, the idea is that after gaining access and setting up their backdoor, they might deploy ransomware to delete backups to make it harder for the bank to recover from the attack.

Let's think about the motives here. If the goal is to steal money, why would they also delete backups? Well, deleting backups could serve a few purposes:

1. **Disruption**: By deleting backups, the bank may have a harder time recovering their systems, which could cause more chaos and potentially allow the attackers to exfiltrate more data or money while the bank is dealing with the disruption.

2. **Cover tracks**: Deleting backups might help the attackers cover their tracks by removing potential logs or data that could be used to trace their activities.

3. **Double extortion**: In some ransomware attacks, attackers not only encrypt files but also steal sensitive data, threatening to release it unless additional ransom is paid. Deleting backups could be part of this strategy, making it harder for the victim to recover without paying.

However, in the context of a bank heist, where the primary goal is financial gain through theft, the deployment of ransomware might be seen as an additional step that could raise alarms or complicate the operation. Banks have robust security measures, and such overt actions might increase the risk of detection or interruption of the heist.

On the other hand, Lazarus is known for conducting sophisticated and patient attacks, often combining multiple tactics to achieve their goals. They might see the deletion of backups as a necessary step to ensure the success of their heist by causing confusion and disruption.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary tactics and techniques, this sequence makes some sense. After initial access (using backdoor malware), they might perform defense evasion (deleting backups to evade detection or hinder incident response), and then move laterally or exfiltrate data.

But, in the specific context of a bank heist, I wonder if deleting backups is a common practice. Banks typically have multiple layers of backups and disaster recovery plans. Deleting Volume Shadow Copies and backup files might not completely prevent recovery, but it could certainly cause significant disruption.

Another consideration is the attribution aspect. Deploying ransomware is a tactic that could divert attention from the true intentions of the attack. If the bank is focused on dealing with a ransomware incident, they might not immediately realize that a heist is occurring simultaneously.

Given all this, it seems plausible that the Lazarus group could deploy Hermes ransomware for the purposes described. However, the question is whether it's likely in this specific scenario.

Let me consider the following points:

- **Likelihood based on group's tactics**: Lazarus has used ransomware in the past, so it's within their capabilities and tactics.

- **Alignment with objectives**: Deleting backups could align with their objectives of causing disruption and covering their tracks.

- **Risk vs. reward**: The additional step of deploying ransomware might increase the risk of detection, but if they believe it will help achieve their primary goal of stealing money, they might deem it worthwhile.

- **Complexity of the operation**: Lazarus is known for conducting complex operations, so adding this layer of activity isn't unprecedented.

Considering these points, it seems reasonable to conclude that yes, it is likely that the Lazarus group would deploy Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files during a bank heist.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
