To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and determine whether the Konni APT group is likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, to evade detection, especially in the context provided.

First, let's break down the sequence of events mentioned in the question:

1. **'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes for persistence.**

   - This suggests that the attackers are using batch and VBScript files to achieve persistence on the target system. Scheduling a script to run at regular intervals is a common technique used by APT groups to maintain access to the compromised system.

2. **Is the Konni APT Group likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, to evade detection?**

   - Obfuscation is a technique used by malware authors and APT groups to make their code difficult to analyze and understand, thereby evading detection by security solutions.

3. **Prior to 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details such as directory listings and running processes.**

   - After achieving persistence, the attackers use another batch file, 'versioninfo.bat', to gather information about the system, such as directory listings and running processes. This is typical behavior for reconnaissance, where attackers gather information to plan their next moves.

Now, considering the above sequence, I need to evaluate whether it's likely that the Konni APT group would use heavily obfuscated scripts, particularly employing techniques like XOR encryption, to evade detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding Konni APT Group:**

   - The Konni APT group is known for its targeted attacks, often using malware that is designed to steal sensitive information from victims, particularly in the government and diplomatic sectors.

   - Konni malware is known for its use of various techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection, including the use of registry modifications, scheduled tasks, and the execution of malicious scripts.

2. **Use of Obfuscation Techniques:**

   - Obfuscation is a common tactic used by APT groups to make their malware and scripts harder to detect and analyze. Techniques like XOR encryption can be used to encode parts of the script or malware, making static analysis more difficult.

   - Given that the Konni group is engaged in long-term, targeted attacks, it is likely that they employ various obfuscation techniques to prolong the lifespan of their malware on target systems.

3. **Context of the Sequence:**

   - In the sequence described, 'stopedge.bat' is scheduling 'install.vbs' for persistence. If these scripts are not obfuscated, they may be easily detected and removed by security software or system administrators.

   - Therefore, it makes sense for the Konni group to obfuscate these scripts to evade detection and ensure that their persistence mechanism remains in place.

4. **Reconnaissance Phase:**

   - Before proceeding to the next stage, which involves using 'versioninfo.bat' to gather system information, it is crucial for the attackers to remain undetected.

   - Obfuscating the scripts not only helps in maintaining persistence but also in conducting reconnaissance activities without being noticed.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above reasoning, it is highly likely that the Konni APT group would use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR encryption, to evade detection, especially in the context of scheduling persistence mechanisms and conducting reconnaissance on the target system.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
