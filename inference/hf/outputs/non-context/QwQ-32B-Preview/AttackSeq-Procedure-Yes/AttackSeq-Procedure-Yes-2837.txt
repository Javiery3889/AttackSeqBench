To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand what's being asked. The question is about a malware that has already executed the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to gather system information and process lists. Now, we need to determine if it's likely that this malware will use HTTPS for its command and control (C2) communications.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Our task is to choose between these two options based on the information provided.

First, let's consider what the malware has already done. It has used 'cmd.exe' to run 'tasklist' and 'systeminfo', which are standard Windows commands. 'Tasklist' shows the currently running processes, and 'systeminfo' provides detailed information about the system's hardware and software configuration.

Why would malware perform these actions? Likely, it's trying to gather intelligence about the system it's running on. This information can help the malware determine the system's capabilities, identify security software, and perhaps tailor its actions based on the environment.

Now, regarding C2 communications, malware needs to communicate with its operators or a remote server to receive further instructions, upload stolen data, or download additional payloads. The choice of communication protocol is important for the malware's operational security and effectiveness.

HTTPS is a secure communication protocol that encrypts data transmitted between a client and a server. Using HTTPS for C2 communications can provide several benefits to malware:

1. **Encryption**: HTTPS encrypts the data, making it harder for network security solutions to inspect the traffic and detect malicious activities.

2. **Legitimacy**: Many legitimate services use HTTPS, so using it for C2 can help malware blend in with normal traffic, avoiding suspicion.

3. **Reliability**: HTTPS is widely supported and allowed through most firewalls and proxies, increasing the chances that the C2 communications will succeed.

Given these advantages, it's reasonable to assume that malware designers would prefer to use HTTPS for C2 communications.

However, we need to consider whether the malware's previous actions indicate that it will use HTTPS for C2.

The fact that the malware used 'cmd.exe' to run system commands suggests that it can execute commands on the system. This capability could be used for various purposes, including establishing network connections.

But does the execution of 'tasklist' and 'systeminfo' directly imply that the malware will use HTTPS for C2? Not necessarily. These commands are more about reconnaissance and don't directly relate to network communications.

Nevertheless, malware often performs reconnaissance before establishing C2 communications. It's possible that the malware is assessing the system to determine how to configure its C2 communications.

But without more specific information linking the gathered information to HTTPS C2, we can't be certain.

So, is it likely that the malware will use HTTPS for C2 based solely on the information provided?

Considering that HTTPS is a common choice for malware C2 due to its security and ubiquity, and there's no information suggesting otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that yes, the malware is likely to use HTTPS for its C2 operations.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
