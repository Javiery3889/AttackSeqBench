To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine the likelihood that the encoded PowerShell script will execute and download the mentioned malware payloads.

First, let's break down the attack sequence:

1. **Initial Access:** The attack begins with phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This is a common method for initial access, as phishing emails can trick users into opening attachments that contain malware.

2. **Malicious Document:** The Word document likely contains a macro or an embedded script that is designed to be executed on the target system. In this case, it's mentioned that a VBS (Visual Basic Script) macro is used to retrieve an encoded PowerShell script.

3. **Encoded PowerShell Script:** The PowerShell script is encoded to evade detection by security software. Once decoded and executed, it can perform various actions, including downloading additional payloads.

4. **Payloads:** The payloads in question are associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Ursnif is a banking Trojan, and GandCrab was a ransomware variant. Both are known malware families that can cause significant damage to systems.

Now, let's consider each part of this sequence and assess the plausibility.

**Initial Access via Phishing Emails:**

Phishing emails are a prevalent method for gaining initial access. Users can be tricked into opening attachments or clicking on links that deliver malware. Therefore, this initial vector is plausible.

**Malicious Word Document with VBS Macro:**

Word documents can contain macros, and malicious actors often exploit this feature to execute code on the target system. VBS macros can be used to run scripts, including retrieving and executing other scripts like PowerShell.

**Encoded PowerShell Script:**

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language used for task automation and configuration management. It's also commonly abused by attackers due to its flexibility and the extensive capabilities it provides for interacting with the system and network.

Encoding the PowerShell script is a technique used to obfuscate the code, making it harder for security solutions to detect the malicious content. This is a standard practice in malware development.

**Downloading Payloads:**

Once the PowerShell script is executed, it can make network requests to download additional payloads. These payloads can include various types of malware, such as Trojans and ransomware, as mentioned in the question.

Given this sequence, it is indeed plausible that the encoded PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro from a malicious Word document delivered through phishing emails, will execute and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
