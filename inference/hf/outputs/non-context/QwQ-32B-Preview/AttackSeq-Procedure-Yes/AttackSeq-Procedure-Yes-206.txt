To answer this question, I need to think about the sequence of tactics and techniques that an attacker like FamousSparrow might use during a cyber attack, particularly focusing on the Credential Access and Discovery phases as per the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Credential Access**: The attacker has already used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials. Mimikatz is a well-known tool for extracting plaintext credentials from memory, which can include passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets.

2. **Discovery Phase**: After gaining access and obtaining credentials, the next logical step for an attacker is to understand the environment they are in. This involves collecting information about the system, network, and potential targets.

3. **Specific Information Sought**: The question mentions collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.

4. **Follow-up Actions**: After discovery, the attacker plans to read file contents and exfiltrate them to a command and control (C&C) server.

Now, let's consider whether it makes sense for FamousSparrow to collect this specific system information during the Discovery phase.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Purpose of Discovery**: The Discovery phase is crucial for attackers as it helps them map out the environment, identify high-value targets, and plan their lateral movement within the network. Collecting system information is a standard part of this phase.

2. **Relevance of Information**:
   - **Usernames**: Knowing usernames can help the attacker understand who has access to what resources and can be useful for lateral movement.
   - **Computer Names**: Computer names often indicate the role of the machine (e.g., servers, workstations), which can guide the attacker in prioritizing targets.
   - **RDP Session IDs**: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session IDs can be useful for maintaining persistence or moving laterally by taking over active sessions.
   - **Drive Types**: Understanding the types of drives can help the attacker identify storage locations that may contain sensitive data.

3. **Sequence of Actions**: The sequence described—Credential Access followed by Discovery and then Data Exfiltration—is a common pattern in many attack scenarios. Attackers typically need to understand the environment before they can effectively exfiltrate data.

4. **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the Discovery phase includes various techniques such as System Owner/User Discovery, System Network Configuration Discovery, and System Service Discovery, which align with collecting the mentioned information.

5. **Practicality**: From a practical standpoint, collecting this information would indeed be beneficial for the attacker to proceed with their objectives efficiently.

Given this analysis, it seems plausible that FamousSparrow would collect such system information during the Discovery phase before proceeding to read and exfiltrate file contents.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the standard sequence of attack phases and the benefits of collecting the specified system information, the answer is likely "Yes." Therefore, the correct choice is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
