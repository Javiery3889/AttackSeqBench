To answer this question, I need to think about how malware like BADBOX might operate, especially given that it's using firmware backdoors gained through supply chain vulnerabilities. The question is asking if it's likely that after exploiting these vulnerabilities and installing backdoors, the malware will establish a backdoor connection to a command-and-control (C2) server before injecting additional modules into the device memory to enable further capabilities.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events in such an attack. Supply chain vulnerabilities can be exploited to insert malicious code, like backdoors, into devices during their manufacturing or distribution process. This means that the malware could be present in the device's firmware right from the start.

Once the device is deployed and connected to a network, the backdoor could be used to establish a connection to a C2 server. This connection would allow the attackers to control the device remotely, issue commands, and potentially download and install additional malicious modules to enhance the malware's capabilities.

So, considering this sequence:

1. Exploit supply chain vulnerabilities to insert firmware backdoors.

2. Device is deployed and connects to the network.

3. Backdoor is triggered to connect to the C2 server.

4. Through the C2 server, additional modules are injected into the device memory to enable further capabilities.

This seems like a logical sequence for a sophisticated malware operation. The initial backdoor allows initial access and control, and then the attackers can decide what additional functionalities they want to deploy based on their objectives.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the sequence I've outlined, it seems likely that the malware would use a backdoor connection to a C2 server before injecting additional modules. This allows for flexibility in controlling the malware and updating its capabilities as needed.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
