So I've got this question here about spear phishing emails that contain links to RTF documents exploiting a specific CVE to deliver QuasarRAT. The question is asking whether it's likely that recipients will be presented with a document that looks like a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

First, I need to break down the components of this question to understand what's being asked.

1. **Spear Phishing Emails**: These are targeted phishing emails sent to specific individuals or organizations. They are more personalized and often harder to detect than mass phishing emails.

2. **Links to RTF Documents**: RTF stands for Rich Text Format, which is a file format that allows for the inclusion of formatted text, images, and even macros or other executable content.

3. **Exploiting CVE-2017-8750**: This is a specific vulnerability, and I should look into what this CVE is about to understand how it's being used in this context.

4. **QuasarRAT Delivery**: QuasarRAT is a type of remote access Trojan, which is malware that allows attackers to control the infected system remotely.

The question is whether, in this scenario, the recipients would see a document that appears to be a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected.

To answer this, I need to consider how such an attack might be carried out.

First, let's look up CVE-2017-8750 to understand what it is.

**CVE-2017-8750**: This is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows remote code execution. Specifically, it's related to how Office handles certain objects in memory, which can be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Given that, the attack sequence likely involves:

- Sending spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents.

- These RTF documents contain exploit code that targets CVE-2017-8750.

- When the recipient opens the document, the exploit code executes, delivering QuasarRAT.

Now, the question is whether the document itself would appear to be a legitimate blog post or report.

In social engineering attacks, including phishing, it's common for attackers to use documents that look legitimate to trick users into opening them. The more convincing the document looks, the higher the chances of success.

So, it's likely that the RTF document would be designed to look like a genuine document, such as a blog post or report, to entice the recipient to open it without suspicion.

Furthermore, the exploit code would be embedded in such a way that it runs when the document is opened, potentially without the user's knowledge.

Therefore, based on standard phishing tactics, it's plausible that the document would simulate a legitimate blog post or report.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the above reasoning, I think the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that recipients would be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

**Final Answer: A**
