To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

First, the question mentions that Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a has evaded detection by modifying the firmware update process and preventing event logging of its operations. This suggests that the malware has gained a level of control over the system's firmware, which is a low-level component of the system's architecture. By modifying the firmware update process, it can persist on the system and hide its activities from higher-level system monitoring tools.

Preventing event logging is another tactic used by malware to avoid detection. Event logs are crucial for system administrators and security teams to monitor system activities and identify any anomalous behavior. By suppressing these logs, the malware can operate more stealthily, making it harder to trace its actions.

Now, the question asks whether, given these capabilities, the malware is likely capable of wiping server disks as part of hiding tracks and potentially disrupting operations.

Let's consider the implications:

1. **Firmware Control**: Since the malware has modified the firmware update process, it has a deep level of access to the system. Firmware is the low-level software that controls the hardware components. Gaining control at this level can provide the malware with extensive capabilities, including the ability to manipulate data storage devices.

2. **Event Logging Suppression**: By preventing event logging, the malware not only hides its current activities but also makes it difficult to reconstruct past activities in case of an investigation. This could be part of a strategy to cover its tracks thoroughly.

3. **Wiping Server Disks**: Disk wiping is a destructive action that can be used by malware for various purposes, such as covering its tracks by removing evidence of its presence, destroying data to cause disruption, or making data recovery impossible.

Given that the malware has already demonstrated the ability to modify firmware and suppress logging, it's plausible that it could also perform more aggressive actions like disk wiping. Firmware-level access often provides the capability to control and manipulate storage devices, which would be necessary for wiping disks.

Moreover, if the malware's goal is to hide its tracks and potentially disrupt operations, wiping disks would align with these objectives. By deleting data, it not only removes any traces of its activity but also causes significant damage to the organization by destroying critical information.

Therefore, based on the capabilities described—modifying firmware update processes and preventing event logging—it is likely that Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a could be capable of wiping server disks.

**Final Answer: A**
