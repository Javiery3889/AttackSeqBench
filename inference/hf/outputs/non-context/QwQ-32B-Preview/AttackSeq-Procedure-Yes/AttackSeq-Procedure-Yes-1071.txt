To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the context provided:

- There's a malware called SLUB that's interacting with a Mattermost server.

- This interaction is happening during the Discovery phase of the attack.

- During this phase, the malware is collecting system information and capturing screenshots.

Now, the question is asking whether, after this Discovery phase, the malware is likely to exfiltrate the collected data (system information and screenshots) via the same Mattermost server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

We have two answer choices: A) Yes and B) No.

To determine the most plausible answer, let's consider a few factors:

1. **Use of Mattermost Server:** The malware is already using the Mattermost server for communication during the Discovery phase. It's possible that the server is being used as a command and control (C2) server.

2. **Exfiltration Methods:** Malware often uses the same channels for exfiltration that it uses for communication with its C2 server. This is because the infrastructure is already in place and may be less suspicious if it's consistent.

3. **Security Measures:** If the organization has security measures in place, such as monitoring or blocking unusual data flows, using the same channel for exfiltration might be riskier.

4. **Malware Design:** Some malware is designed to use multiple exfiltration methods or channels to avoid detection or to increase the chances of successful data theft.

Given these points, let's think about the likelihood of the malware using the same Mattermost server for exfiltration.

On one hand, using the same server for exfiltration makes sense from a malware design perspective because it simplifies communication and reduces the need to set up additional infrastructure. It also maintains consistency in traffic patterns, which might help evade detection if the server is already expected to handle certain types of data.

On the other hand, if the organization is monitoring the Mattermost server or network traffic to and from it, using the same channel for exfiltration could raise red flags, especially if the data being sent differs significantly from normal traffic.

However, since the malware has already been using the server for communication during the Discovery phase, it's plausible that it would continue to use it for exfiltration, assuming that the initial communication hasn't already been detected or blocked.

Moreover, using the same server for exfiltration aligns with common malware behavior. Many malware strains use their C2 servers for both commanding the malware and exfiltrating data.

Therefore, based on this analysis, it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate the system information and screenshots via the same Mattermost server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

So, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
