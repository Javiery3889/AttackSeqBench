To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the specified actions align with typical malware behavior, specifically focusing on the DNSpionage malware.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Achieved through malicious Microsoft Office documents distributed via spear-phishing.

2. **Malware Involved:** DNSpionage malware.

3. **Actions in Question:**

   a. Requires human interaction to execute payloads.

   b. Maintains persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0'.

I need to determine if these actions are likely given the initial access method and the malware in question.

### Step 1: Understanding Initial Access

Malicious Office documents via spear-phishing are a common initial access vector. These documents often contain exploits that, when opened, execute malicious code on the target's system.

### Step 2: DNSpionage Malware Behavior

DNSpionage, also known as DNSpionage or Operation GhostShell, is a sophisticated malware campaign that has been used in targeted attacks, particularly against government and diplomatic organizations. It is known for its use of DNS tunneling to exfiltrate data and receive commands.

Typical behaviors of DNSpionage include:

- **Initial Infection Vector:** Often delivered via spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links.

- **Payload Execution:** The malware may require some level of user interaction to execute, such as enabling macros in Office documents.

- **Persistence Mechanisms:** Establishing persistent access, which could involve creating scheduled tasks, modifying registry entries, or using other methods to ensure the malware runs at system startup or at regular intervals.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Actions

#### Action a: Requires Human Interaction to Execute Payloads

In many malware campaigns, especially those involving Office documents, the payload requires the user to enable macros or perform some action that triggers the execution of the malicious code. This is because modern Office applications have security features that disable macros by default.

Given that the initial access is through malicious Office documents, it is plausible that human interaction is required to execute the payloads.

#### Action b: Maintaining Persistence with a Scheduled Task

Creating scheduled tasks is a common method for malware to maintain persistence. The name 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0' seems suspicious because it mimics legitimate software update mechanisms, which is a tactic used by malware authors to blend in with normal system processes.

Therefore, it is likely that DNSpionage or similar malware would use such a method to maintain persistence.

### Step 4: Cross-Referencing with MITRE ATT&CK Framework

To further validate these actions, I can refer to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which catalogs various adversarial tactics and techniques.

- **Tactic:** Initial Access (TA0001)

- **Technique:** Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)

- **Tactic:** Execution (TA0002)

- **Technique:** Executable Installed (T1117)

- **Tactic:** Persistence (TA0003)

- **Technique:** Scheduled Task/Job (T1053)

These techniques align with the actions described in the question, supporting the likelihood of the described sequence.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Given the initial access method and the known behaviors of DNSpionage malware, it is likely that the malware requires human interaction to execute payloads and maintains persistence by creating a scheduled task with a name like 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0'.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
