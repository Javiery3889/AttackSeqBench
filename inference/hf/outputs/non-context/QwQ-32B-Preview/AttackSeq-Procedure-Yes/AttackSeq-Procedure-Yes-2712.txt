To answer this question, I need to consider the behavior of the IEXPL0RE RAT and how it typically communicates with its command and control (C2) server, especially after collecting sensitive data like keystrokes and passwords.

First, I should understand what a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is. A RAT is a type of malware that provides attackers with remote control over an infected machine. It can perform various actions, including keylogging, data exfiltration, and receiving further instructions from the C2 server.

In this scenario, the IEXPL0RE RAT has already recorded keystrokes and exfiltrated data such as passwords. Now, the question is whether it is likely to communicate with the C2 server using encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for exfiltration and further instructions.

Let's consider the following points:

1. **Encryption in Communication:**
   - Encrypted communication between the malware and the C2 server is common because it helps evade detection by security solutions that might monitor and block unencrypted traffic.
   - Using HTTPS (HTTP over TLS/SSL) can make the traffic appear legitimate and blend in with normal web traffic.

2. **Use of HTTP Methods:**
   - HTTP POST and GET methods are standard ways to transmit data over the web.
   - POST is often used for sending data to the server, while GET is used for requesting data from the server.
   - Malware might use both methods depending on the type of data being sent or received.

3. **Behavior of IEXPL0RE RAT:**
   - IEXPL0RE is likely a specific variant of a RAT that might have particular communication patterns.
   - However, without specific details about this particular RAT, I need to consider general behaviors of such malware.

4. **Exfiltration and Further Instructions:**
   - After collecting data, the RAT needs to send it to the C2 server (exfiltration) and receive further commands.
   - Using encrypted HTTP methods for both exfiltration and receiving instructions is a plausible approach for maintaining stealth and functionality.

Given these points, it seems likely that the IEXPL0RE RAT would use encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for communicating with the C2 server, especially after exfiltrating sensitive data like passwords.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
