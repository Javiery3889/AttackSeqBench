So I've got this question here about malware and cyber attacks, and I need to choose between "Yes" and "No." Let me try to understand what's being asked.

First, there's a zero-day exploit in a Word document that infects a target with something called Plexor malware. Then, it mentions Longhorn's tools and whether they're likely to follow guidelines to avoid detection before doing system fingerprinting and discovery.

Okay, so zero-day exploit means it's a previously unknown vulnerability that's being exploited. Word documents can contain malicious code, especially if they have macros or other active content. Plexor malware is likely some kind of malicious software that's being installed on the target's system through this exploit.

Longhorn seems to be a group or a set of tools associated with this attack. I need to figure out if these tools are likely to follow certain guidelines to avoid detection before they start looking around the system to gather information.

System fingerprinting is when malware tries to identify details about the system it's running on, like the operating system version, installed software, etc. Discovery capabilities would involve scanning the network, enumerating users, and so on, to understand the environment better.

The question is asking if, in this sequence of events, it's likely that Longhorn's tools would take steps to avoid detection before doing this fingerprinting and discovery.

Well, generally, malware and attackers try to remain undetected as long as possible to carry out their objectives. So, it makes sense that they would take steps to avoid detection.

But, in the sequence described, the system has already been infected with Plexor malware using a zero-day exploit. So, the initial infection has already occurred without being detected (since it's a zero-day exploit).

Now, after infection, the malware needs to operate quietly to avoid raising alarms while it gathers information and potentially carries out further actions.

Therefore, it is likely that Longhorn's tools would follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

Wait a minute, but the question says "is it likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware?"

I need to consider if, in the context provided, it's likely that they would take steps to avoid detection before doing fingerprinting and discovery.

Given that the malware has already been installed using a zero-day exploit, which is stealthy by nature, it makes sense that the next steps would also be designed to avoid detection.

Espionage-focused malware especially needs to remain undetected to gather as much information as possible over a longer period.

Therefore, it's likely that Longhorn's tools would indeed follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.

So, I think "Yes" is the correct answer.

But let me think about it from another angle. Maybe there are scenarios where malware doesn't bother with stealth after infection.

For example, if the malware's goal is to cause immediate damage or steal specific data quickly, it might not care about remaining undetected for a long time.

However, in this case, it's described as espionage-focused, which typically implies a longer-term presence on the system to gather intelligence over time.

Therefore, maintaining stealth is probably a higher priority.

Additionally, performing fingerprinting and discovery quietly is crucial to avoid triggering security alerts.

So, in conclusion, it is likely that Longhorn's tools would follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
