To answer this question, I need to consider the nature of threat actors, particularly AridViper, and their typical modus operandi in terms of malware deployment and command and control (C2) infrastructure.

First, I should understand who AridViper is. AridViper is a known threat actor group, and like many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, they often employ sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.

One common practice among APT groups is to use multiple C2 domains or servers. This approach helps them to:

1. **Ensure Redundancy:** If one C2 domain is taken down or blocked, others can still be used to control the malware.

2. **Evade Detection:** Spreading C2 communications across multiple domains can make it harder for defenders to identify and block all communication channels.

3. **Compartmentalization:** Different C2 domains might be used for different campaigns or types of malware, allowing the threat actors to compartmentalize their operations and minimize the impact if one part is compromised.

Given that the initial malware sample is communicating with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info, it is plausible that further analysis could reveal additional associated malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains. This would align with the typical behavior of APT groups like AridViper, who aim to maintain stealth and resilience in their operations.

Moreover, in the field of threat intelligence, it is common to find that malware samples from the same actor or campaign share similar codebases, configurations, or infrastructure indicators. Therefore, analyzing the initial malware sample could uncover artifacts or patterns that link it to other malware samples and C2 domains used by AridViper.

In conclusion, based on the typical tactics of APT groups and the likelihood of using multiple C2 domains for redundancy and evasion, it is reasonable to expect that further analysis of the initial malware sample would reveal additional associated malware samples communicating with multiple C2 domains used by AridViper.

**Final Answer: A**
