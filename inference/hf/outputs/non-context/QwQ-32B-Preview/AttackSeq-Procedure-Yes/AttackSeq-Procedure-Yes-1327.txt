To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the exfiltration method mentioned aligns with the collection methods used.

First, let's break down the information given:

- **Collection Phase:**
  - Techniques used: keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer.
  - Purpose: to collect information from the target's system.

- **Exfiltration Phase:**
  - Proposed method: automatically upload collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites.

I need to evaluate whether this exfiltration method is likely, given the collection techniques used.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Collection Techniques:**
   - **Keylogger:** Records keystrokes to capture sensitive information like passwords, emails, and other text inputs.
   - **Screenshotter:** Takes periodic screenshots to capture visual data from the target's screen, which can include open applications, documents, and more.
   - **Clipboard Stealer:** Monitors and captures data stored in the clipboard, which can include URLs, passwords, and other copied information.

   These techniques are common in espionage and malware operations aimed at gathering sensitive information from targets.

2. **Exfiltration Method Proposed:**
   - Automatically upload collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials.
   - Contact live remote sites during the exfiltration phase.

3. **Evaluating Plausibility:**
   - **Use of FTP for Exfiltration:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard protocol for transferring files over a network. It can be used for exfiltrating data, but it's important to consider its security implications.
     - FTP transmissions are not encrypted by default, meaning that data transferred via FTP can be intercepted and read by anyone who can access the network traffic. This could expose the exfiltrated data to third parties.
     - However, some FTP servers support FTPS (FTP over SSL) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), which provide encryption. If CosmicDuke uses these secure variants, the exfiltration would be more secure.

   - **Using Stored Login Credentials:**
     - If CosmicDuke has collected login credentials via the keylogger or other means, it might attempt to use these credentials to access remote servers for exfiltration.
     - This could involve using legitimate FTP accounts or exploiting compromised credentials to gain access to remote servers.

   - **Contacting Live Remote Sites:**
     - Exfiltrating data to live remote sites suggests that the malware is designed to communicate with active servers that are monitored by the attackers.
     - This could be for immediate retrieval of the exfiltrated data or for further command and control activities.

4. **Considering Alternatives:**
   - There are various other methods for exfiltrating data, such as:
     - Email attachments.
     - DNS tunneling.
     - HTTP/HTTPS requests.
     - Cloud storage services.
     - Encrypted channels like Tor or VPNs.

   - The choice of FTP for exfiltration might be less common in modern malware due to the potential lack of encryption and the prevalence of more secure and stealthier methods.

5. **MITRE ATT&CK Framework Context:**
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes adversary behaviors and techniques.
   - Collection techniques like keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing are part of the "Collection" phase.
   - Exfiltration techniques include various methods of transmitting data out of the target network, such as "Exfiltration Over C2 Channel" or "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol."

   - Using FTP for exfiltration could be mapped to "Exfiltration Over Network" or "Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol," depending on the specific implementation.

6. **Likelihood Assessment:**
   - Given that CosmicDuke has already invested in sophisticated collection techniques, it is plausible that it would employ a straightforward exfiltration method like FTP, especially if it can leverage stored credentials.
   - However, the use of FTP without encryption might be risky, as it could expose the exfiltrated data to detection or interception.
   - Alternatively, CosmicDuke might prefer more stealthy and secure exfiltration methods to avoid detection and ensure the integrity of the exfiltrated data.

### Conclusion

Considering the above points, it is possible that CosmicDuke could use FTP with stored credentials for exfiltration, but it might not be the most likely or secure method chosen by advanced adversaries. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
