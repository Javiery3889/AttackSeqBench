To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

First, we have the PowerLess Backdoor, which has achieved credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' and utilizing a keylogger. This suggests that the backdoor has already gained a significant level of access on the target system, as it can manipulate system components and install persistent monitoring tools like a keylogger.

Now, the question is whether, as part of its capabilities, it is likely to target local user accounts on compromised systems for account discovery.

Let's consider what account discovery entails. Account discovery is a technique where an attacker tries to identify and gather information about user accounts on a system or within a network. This can involve enumerating user names, group memberships, permissions, and other details that could be useful for further exploitation or maintaining access.

Given that PowerLess Backdoor has already achieved credential access, it's logical to assume that it would want to expand its knowledge of the environment to enhance its effectiveness and persistence. Targeting local user accounts for account discovery aligns with this objective because understanding the user accounts can help the backdoor to:

1. **Identify high-value accounts:** Such as administrators or power users who have more privileges, which could be useful for lateral movement or escalating privileges further.

2. **Create new accounts:** Potentially setting up backdoors or additional entry points for future access.

3. **Monitor activities:** By understanding who has access to what, the backdoor can better position itself to capture sensitive information or maintain stealth.

4. **Avoid detection:** By blending in with normal user activities or using less suspicious accounts for its operations.

Moreover, the use of 'Comsvcs.dll' for credential dumping suggests that the backdoor has the capability to interact with system-level components, which are often necessary for performing account discovery. Keyloggers, on the other hand, can capture credentials in real-time, providing fresh access to user accounts.

Therefore, it is plausible that PowerLess Backdoor would include account discovery as part of its capabilities, specifically targeting local user accounts on compromised systems.

Given this analysis, the answer to the question is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
