So I've got this question about the FHAPPI campaign and some steps in an APT phishing attack. Let's break it down.

First, the question mentions that the FHAPPI campaign delivered a phishing email with a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website. Then, there's a VBScript that downloads and opens a .doc file, which gets executed. After that, the question asks whether it's likely that a PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

I need to decide between "Yes" and "No" for the answer choices.

Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. **Understanding the Attack Sequence:**

   - Phishing email with a link.

   - The link points to malware on a Geocities website.

   - A VBScript is involved in downloading and opening a .doc file.

   - The .doc file is executed.

2. **What Happens Next:**

   - After the .doc file is executed, the question is about whether a PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code, and if the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

3. **Analyzing the Components:**

   - **Phishing Email and Link:** This is a common initial vector for many APT attacks.

   - **Geocities Website:** Geocities was shut down in 2009, but perhaps there's a typo, and it's "GeoCities" or another hosting service. Regardless, the point is that the malware is hosted on a website.

   - **VBScript Downloading a .doc File:** VBScripts can be used to automate tasks, including downloading files. In this case, it's downloading a .doc file.

   - **Executing the .doc File:** Typically, .doc files are documents, but if they contain macros or other executable content, they can be used to run code.

4. **PowerShell Involvement:**

   - The question is whether, after these steps, a PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code, and if PowerShell will be used for further execution.

5. **Likelihood Assessment:**

   - In modern APT attacks, it's common for attackers to use PowerShell for execution because it's a powerful scripting language that's built into Windows, making it a useful tool for both legitimate administrators and malicious actors.

   - Base64 encoding is often used to obfuscate code, making it harder for security solutions to detect the malicious payload.

6. **Connecting the Dots:**

   - If the .doc file is executed and it contains macros, those macros could, in turn, execute PowerShell commands.

   - These PowerShell commands could decode base64 encoded strings to reveal the actual malicious payload.

7. **Conclusion:**

   - Given that PowerShell is a common tool used in APT attacks and that base64 encoding is frequently used for obfuscation, it is plausible that after the steps described, the malware would use PowerShell to run base64 encoded code for further execution.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
