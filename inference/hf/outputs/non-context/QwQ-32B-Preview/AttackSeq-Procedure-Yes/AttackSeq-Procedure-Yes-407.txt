To answer this question, I need to analyze the scenario described and evaluate whether it's likely that the malicious Excel file contained a macro designed to display a fake invoice while running malicious code in the background to install ISMAgent, given that the phishing emails are associated with the OilRig campaign.

First, let's break down the components of the question:

1. **Phishing Emails from OilRig Campaign:** OilRig is a sophisticated threat group known for targeting organizations in the Middle East, particularly those in the energy and healthcare sectors. Their tactics typically involve spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.

2. **Malicious Excel File with Macro:** The attachment is an Excel file that contains a macro. Macros in Office documents can be used to automate tasks but are also a common vector for malware delivery because they can execute code.

3. **Fake Invoice:** The macro is designed to display a fake invoice, which is likely intended to distract the user and make them believe that the file is legitimate.

4. **Running Malicious Code in Background:** While displaying the fake invoice, the macro also runs malicious code in the background to install ISMAgent, which is a malware variant associated with OilRig.

Given this context, I need to determine if this sequence of events is plausible based on known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the OilRig threat group.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **OilRig TTPs:** OilRig is known for using phishing emails with malicious attachments, often using Office documents like Word and Excel files that contain malicious macros. They are also known for employing macro-based malware to deliver secondary payloads, such as backdoors and information stealers.

2. **Use of Macros:** It's common for threat actors, including OilRig, to use macros to execute malicious code within Office documents. Users are often tricked into enabling macros by social engineering tactics, such as being presented with a plausible reason like viewing an invoice.

3. **Fake Invoice as a Decoy:** Displaying a fake invoice is a plausible social engineering tactic. It provides a legitimate-looking document that distracts the user while the macro runs malicious code in the background.

4. **Installation of ISMAgent:** ISMAgent is a malware variant associated with OilRig. It's a backdoor that allows threat actors to maintain persistent access to compromised systems and perform various malicious activities.

Given these points, the scenario described aligns well with the known TTPs of the OilRig threat group. They have been observed using malicious macros in Office documents to deliver malware, and ISMAgent is one of the payloads they deploy.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, it is likely that the malicious Excel file attached to the delivery email contained a macro designed to display a fake invoice while running malicious code in the background to install ISMAgent, especially given the association with the OilRig campaign.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
