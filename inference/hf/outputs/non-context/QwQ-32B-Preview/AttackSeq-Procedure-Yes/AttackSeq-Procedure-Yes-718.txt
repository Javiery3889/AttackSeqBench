To answer this question, I need to consider the typical behavior of malware like the Rising Sun implant and how it might handle communication with its control servers.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The implant decrypts and collects network and system information.

2. **Communication with Control Servers**: It's likely to communicate this information back to its operators for further instructions.

Now, the question is whether it's likely that this communication happens via HTTP POST requests for command and control (C2) purposes.

Let's consider the following points:

- **Common C2 Channels**: Malware often uses HTTP or HTTPS for C2 communications because these protocols are usually allowed through firewalls and proxies, making them effective for exfiltrating data and receiving commands.

- **HTTP POST Requests**: These are a standard way to send data to a server. They can carry a payload in the request body, which is suitable for sending collected information back to the control server.

- **Encryption**: If the communication is over HTTPS, it adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for network monitoring tools to inspect the traffic.

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Using HTTP or HTTPS for C2 can be detected by security solutions that monitor web traffic. However, malware authors often employ various techniques to obfuscate their traffic and avoid detection.

Given that the implant has already performed reconnaissance by collecting system and network information, it would need a way to transmit this data to its operators. Using HTTP POST requests is a plausible method for this purpose.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes," it is likely that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

**Final Answer: A**
