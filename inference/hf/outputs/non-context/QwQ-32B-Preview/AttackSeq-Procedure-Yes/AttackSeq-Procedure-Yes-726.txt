To answer this question, I need to analyze the given information and determine whether it's likely that the Rising Sun implant would use the same encryption and encoding methods for data exfiltration as it did for initial communication.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial Reconnaissance:**
   - The implant collected system and network details.
   - It communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - The data was encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. **Data Exfiltration:**
   - The question is asking whether it's likely that the same methods (RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding) would be used for data exfiltration.

Now, I need to consider whether it's plausible for the implant to use the same techniques for data exfiltration based on its initial behavior.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Consistency in TTPs:**
   - Malware often uses consistent techniques across different stages of an attack for simplicity and to reduce the complexity of the code.
   - If the implant used RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding for initial communication, it might continue to use these methods for data exfiltration.

2. **Encryption and Encoding Choices:**
   - **RC4:** It's a stream cipher that was widely used but is now considered insecure due to known vulnerabilities. However, its simplicity and speed might still make it attractive for some malware authors.
   - **Base64 Encoding:** This is a common method to encode binary data into a text format, making it easier to transmit over protocols that expect text data, like HTTP.

3. **HTTP POST Requests:**
   - Using HTTP POST requests for communication is a common tactic, as it blends in with normal network traffic and is less likely to raise alarms.

4. **Data Exfiltration Considerations:**
   - Data exfiltration might involve larger amounts of data and could require more robust encryption to avoid detection and to protect the exfiltrated data.
   - However, if the initial communication used RC4 and Base64 successfully, the malware might continue using the same methods, assuming they have worked without drawing attention.

5. **Potential for Variation:**
   - Some malware variants change their TTPs at different stages to evade detection or to adapt to different network environments.
   - However, changing encryption methods would require additional code and complexity, which might not be necessary if the current methods are sufficient.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the implant used RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding for initial communication and that these methods were effective, it is likely that the same methods would be used for data exfiltration. Malware often maintains consistency in its techniques to simplify operations and reduce complexity, especially if the current methods are successful in evading detection.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
