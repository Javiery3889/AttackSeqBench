To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine if the FlowCloud malware is likely to execute 'Gup.exe', which then executes 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. **Execution Tactic**: The FlowCloud macro renames files and executes 'gup.exe' using a version of certutil.exe (Temptcm.tmp).

This suggests that the malware is using the Execution tactic from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves running malicious code on the target system. Specifically, it's using certutil.exe to execute 'gup.exe'.

2. **Subsequent Actions**: The question asks if, after this execution, 'Gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload components for persistence.

To determine the plausibility of this sequence, I need to consider the typical behavior of malware in such scenarios.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:

- **Initial Execution**: The FlowCloud macro renames files and uses certutil.exe to execute 'gup.exe'. This is a common technique used by malware to execute payloads without writing files to disk initially, as certutil can download and execute code.

- **Execution of 'Gup.exe'**: Assuming 'gup.exe' is successfully executed, the next step would be to see what 'gup.exe' does. Malware often chains executions, where one executable downloads or executes another stage of the payload.

- **Execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe'**: The question suggests that 'Gup.exe' executes 'EhStorAuthn.exe'. I need to verify if this is a likely scenario.

- **Payload Extraction and Installation**: Finally, the question mentions that 'EhStorAuthn.exe' extracts and installs payload file components for persistence. This aligns with typical malware behavior aiming for persistence on the target system.

**Research and Context**:

- **FlowCloud Malware**: I need to research if FlowCloud malware is known to follow this sequence of actions. However, without specific details on FlowCloud's behavior, I'll have to rely on general malware behavior patterns.

- **Temptcm.tmp and Certutil.exe**: Certutil is a common tool used in living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques, where attackers use legitimate system tools to perform malicious actions.

- **Gup.exe and EhStorAuthn.exe**: These executables might be part of the malware's payload or could be legitimate tools repurposed for malicious use.

**Likelihood Assessment**:

- **Chain of Execution**: It's plausible that 'Gup.exe' executes 'EhStorAuthn.exe' as part of a multi-stage payload. Malware often uses multiple stages to perform different tasks, such as initial execution, downloading additional payloads, and establishing persistence.

- **Persistence Mechanism**: Using 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload components for persistence makes sense, as persistence is a key goal for many malware strains.

**Conclusion**:

Given the sequence of events and the typical behavior of malware, it is likely that after executing 'gup.exe', the FlowCloud malware will proceed to execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
