To answer this question, I need to consider the typical behavior of malware, specifically focusing on the SLUB malware and its interaction with a Mattermost server during the Discovery phase. The question is whether it's likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

First, let's break down the phases mentioned:

1. **Discovery Phase**: This is where the malware gathers information about the system it's running on, such as system information and captures screenshots. This phase is crucial for the attacker to understand the environment, identify valuable data, and plan further steps.

2. **Exfiltration Phase**: This is the stage where the malware sends the collected data out of the compromised system to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.

Now, considering the sequence:

- The malware collects system information and captures screenshots during the Discovery phase.

- The question is whether it will automatically exfiltrate this data during the Exfiltration phase.

Given that the Discovery phase is about gathering information, and the Exfiltration phase is about sending that information out, it's logical that after collecting the data, the malware would proceed to exfiltrate it.

However, whether this happens automatically or not can depend on several factors:

- **Malware Design**: Some malware is designed to collect data and exfiltrate it immediately, while others may store the data locally and exfiltrate it at a later time or in response to specific triggers.

- **Operational Security**: Attackers might design their malware to exfiltrate data only at certain times or in certain ways to avoid detection.

- **Resource Constraints**: Exfiltrating data immediately might consume bandwidth or other resources, which could be noticeable. Therefore, malware might be programmed to exfiltrate data in a more stealthy manner.

Given that the question specifies "automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase," we need to assess the likelihood of this happening based on typical malware behavior.

Generally, malware is designed to exfiltrate collected data to the C2 server at some point. Whether this happens automatically or not can vary, but in many cases, especially for efficient and stealthy operations, malware is programmed to exfiltrate data automatically after collection.

Moreover, the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversarial behaviors, includes techniques related to data exfiltration that often follow discovery actions. For example, under the Exfiltration tactic, there are techniques like Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, which aligns with the scenario described.

Considering the SLUB malware specifically, without detailed information about its exact behavior, we can make an educated assumption based on common malware practices.

Therefore, it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

**Final Answer: A**
