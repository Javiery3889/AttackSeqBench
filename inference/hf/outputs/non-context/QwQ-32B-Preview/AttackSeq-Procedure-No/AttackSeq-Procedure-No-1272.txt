To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the specified actions align with typical ransomware behavior, specifically for WastedLocker.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Defense Evasion Phase:**
   - WastedLocker is deployed using PsExec.
   - It stops services and disables Windows Defender.

2. **Impact Phase:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that WastedLocker will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands.

I need to evaluate if this sequence makes sense based on known behaviors of WastedLocker and general ransomware tactics.

### Step 1: Understanding WastedLocker and Its TTPs

WastedLocker is a variant of the MegaCortex ransomware, known for its targeted attacks on industrial and manufacturing companies. It is designed to cause significant disruption by encrypting critical files and demanding ransom payments.

#### Defense Evasion Techniques:

- **PsExec Usage:** PsExec is a legitimate sysadmin tool that can be abused by attackers to execute processes on remote systems. Using PsExec to deploy malware is a common technique for lateral movement and execution.

- **Stopping Services:** Disabling essential services can prevent system functionality and make it harder for security tools to detect the malware.

- **Disabling Windows Defender:** This is a straightforward way to evade antivirus detection and allow the malware to operate without interference.

These actions align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Defense Evasion tactics, specifically techniques like "Disabling Security Tools" and "Indicator Blocking."

#### Impact Phase:

The impact phase in ransomware attacks typically involves the encryption of files and, in some cases, additional destructive actions like data deletion or exfiltration.

### Step 2: Evaluating the Deletion of Volume Shadow Copies

Volume shadow copies are backups created by Windows System Restore and File History features. Ransomware often deletes these copies to prevent victims from recovering their files without paying the ransom.

#### Techniques:

- **Deleting Shadow Copies:** This is achieved by using commands like `vssadmin delete shadows` or powershell commands like `Remove-Item`.

- **Using PowerShell:** PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and shell that can be used for both administrative tasks and malicious activities. It's commonly abused by attackers due to its flexibility and extensive capabilities.

### Step 3: Analyzing the Sequence

Given that WastedLocker has already performed defense evasion techniques such as stopping services and disabling Windows Defender, it is logical that it would proceed to maximize the impact of the attack.

Deleting volume shadow copies is a common step in ransomware attacks to ensure that victims cannot recover their files without paying the ransom. Therefore, it makes sense that after establishing a foothold and evading defenses, the ransomware would proceed to delete shadow copies as part of its impact phase.

### Step 4: Considering the Use of PowerShell

PowerShell is a preferred tool for many attackers because it allows for sophisticated operations and can bypass some security controls. Using PowerShell to delete shadow copies aligns with the versatility and stealth that attackers seek.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the typical behavior of ransomware like WastedLocker and the alignment with known tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is likely that after performing defense evasion techniques, the ransomware would proceed to delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the impact phase.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
