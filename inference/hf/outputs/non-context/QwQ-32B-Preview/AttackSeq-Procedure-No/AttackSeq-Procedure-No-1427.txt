To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the proposed sequence is plausible.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Action:** Keylogging for Collection using `libCache32.exe`.

2. **Subsequent Action:** Extracting Chrome passwords for Credential Access by querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.

I need to determine if this sequence is likely.

### Step 1: Understanding Keylogging for Collection

Keylogging is a common technique used by malware to record keystrokes made by a user, which can then be used to collect sensitive information such as passwords, usernames, and other credentials. In this case, it's mentioned that keylogging is performed using `libCache32.exe` for the purpose of collection.

### Step 2: Extracting Chrome Passwords for Credential Access

After collecting data through keylogging, the next step is to extract Chrome passwords for credential access. This involves querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases, which store user credentials and other sensitive information.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Sequence

I need to evaluate whether it's likely that after performing keylogging with `libCache32.exe`, the spyware would proceed to extract Chrome passwords using `libchrome.exe`.

#### Considerations:

- **Purpose Alignment:** Both keylogging and extracting Chrome passwords aim at credential theft, which aligns with the objective of credential access.

- **Technique Feasibility:** Querying Chrome's SQLite databases is a feasible method to obtain stored passwords, as Chrome stores them in a structured format.

- **Tool Usage:** `libCache32.exe` is used for keylogging, and `libchrome.exe` is used for extracting passwords from Chrome. It's plausible that different components or modules of the spyware are used for different tasks.

- **Sequence Logic:** Performing keylogging first can capture real-time credentials as they are being typed, while extracting passwords from Chrome's database can provide a broader set of stored credentials.

### Step 4: Analyzing Answer Choices

**Answer Choice A: Yes**

- This choice suggests that the sequence is likely.

**Answer Choice B: No**

- This choice suggests that the sequence is not likely.

### Step 5: Making a Decision

Given that both actions are aimed at credential theft and that using different tools for different tasks is common in malware operations, it is plausible that after keylogging, the spyware would proceed to extract Chrome passwords using `libchrome.exe`.

Therefore, the most likely answer is **A: Yes**.

### Final Answer

\[ \boxed{A} \]
