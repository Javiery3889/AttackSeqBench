To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the specific technique mentioned—DNS Calculation for determining a command and control (C2) port—is likely to be used by the threat group FIN13 in the context provided.

First, let's break down the sequence of events described in the question:

1. **Data Collection:** FIN13 collects sensitive data from network shared drives.

2. **Data Archiving:** They archive this data locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.

3. **DNS Calculation:** Before exfiltrating the data, they might use DNS Calculation techniques to determine a C2 port.

4. **Data Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate the data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools.

Now, I need to evaluate whether step 3, the DNS Calculation technique, is plausible in this sequence based on what is known about FIN13's TTPs.

**Understanding FIN13:**

FIN13, also known as APT28, Sofacy, or Strontium, is a Russian cyber espionage group known for targeting a wide range of sectors, including government, military, diplomatic, and commercial organizations. Their TTPs are well-documented in various threat reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It's a useful resource to understand the likely behaviors of different threat groups.

**FIN13 in MITRE ATT&CK:**

Looking up FIN13 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we can see a list of their known tactics and techniques. This includes various methods for initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, and command and control.

**Relevant Techniques:**

- **Command and Control (C2):** FIN13 has been observed using various C2 protocols and methods, including DNS for C2 communications.

- **Data Exfiltration:** They use various methods to exfiltrate data, including web services and custom tools.

**DNS Calculation Technique:**

The specific technique mentioned—multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine a C2 port—is an unusual and specific method for port calculation. While it's possible that FIN13 or any advanced threat group could employ such a technique for obfuscation, it's not a commonly documented method in publicly available threat intelligence reports.

**Evaluation:**

Given that FIN13 is known for using DNS for C2 communications, it's plausible that they could use a unique method to calculate C2 ports based on DNS information. However, the specific method described—multiplying the first two octets and adding the third—doesn't align with any known TTPs attributed to FIN13 in reputable sources like the MITRE ATT&CK framework or published threat reports.

**Conclusion:**

While FIN13 is known to use DNS for C2 communications and has a repertoire of sophisticated techniques, the specific DNS Calculation method mentioned in the question doesn't correspond to known TTPs associated with this threat group. Therefore, it is unlikely that FIN13 would use this particular technique in the sequence described.

**Final Answer: B: No**
