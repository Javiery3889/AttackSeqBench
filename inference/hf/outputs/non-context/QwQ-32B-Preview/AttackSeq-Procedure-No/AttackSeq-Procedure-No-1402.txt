I've got this question here about FIN13's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), specifically regarding their use of certain tools and methods during an attack. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that FIN13 has already used native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during the discovery phase. So, they've already got a foothold in the network and are gathering information about the environment.

Next, it asks whether, after this discovery phase, it's likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network for lateral movement. Then, before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions, they would do this.

So, let's consider the sequence here:

1. Discovery using native OS binaries and custom malware.

2. Lateral movement using PDQ Deploy to spread AvosLocker and tools.

3. Data collection from network shared drives.

4. Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

I need to assess whether this sequence makes sense, especially the use of PDQ Deploy for lateral movement.

First, I should understand what PDQ Deploy is. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool used by system administrators to deploy software, updates, and configurations across a network of computers efficiently. It's a powerful tool that can execute commands and install software remotely on multiple machines.

Now, considering that FIN13 is a cyber threat group known for their attacks, it's plausible that they could abuse legitimate tools like PDQ Deploy if they have gained administrative privileges in the network. Using such tools could allow them to move laterally more efficiently, as they can leverage the existing deployment mechanisms to spread malware like AvosLocker to other machines.

However, I need to consider whether this is likely behavior for FIN13 based on available CTI reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, lateral movement is a common tactic used by attackers to access other parts of the network and spread their influence. There are various techniques under lateral movement, including the use of remote services, remote shells, and software deployment tools.

In the context of FIN13, if they have already gained access and are performing discovery, using a software deployment tool like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement could be a feasible approach, especially if such tools are already present and authorized in the target environment.

Moreover, using legitimate tools can help them maintain operational security, as their activities might blend in with normal administrative actions, avoiding detection by security monitoring systems.

Additionally, AvosLocker is a ransomware variant, and deploying it across the network would be a critical step in their attack lifecycle, aiming to encrypt files and demand ransom.

After deploying AvosLocker and other tools, collecting data from network shared drives makes sense, as they might be looking for sensitive information that can be exfiltrated for extortion or other malicious purposes, such as fraudulent transactions.

So, considering all this, the sequence seems plausible.

However, I should also consider if there are any indicators or reports specifically mentioning FIN13's use of PDQ Deploy or similar software deployment tools. While I don't have specific intelligence on FIN13's toolset at this moment, it's not uncommon for advanced threat actors to use a variety of tools, both legitimate and malicious, to achieve their objectives.

Therefore, based on the general understanding of attack methodologies and the capabilities of tools like PDQ Deploy, it is likely that FIN13 could use such tools for lateral movement.

Hence, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

**Final Answer: A**
