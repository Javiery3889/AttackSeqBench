To answer this question, I need to think about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that a threat actor like POWERSHOWER might use after collecting system information and sending it to a command and control (C2) server. The question is specifically asking whether it's likely for such an actor to use external proxy techniques, like compromising residential endpoints to relay command traffic, as part of maintaining C2.

First, I should understand what POWERSHOWER is. POWERSHOWER is a threat group known for its cyber activities, likely engaging in espionage or other malicious operations. The name suggests that it uses PowerShell, a powerful scripting language built into Windows, for its operations. So, it's probably a sophisticated group that leverages legitimate administrative tools for malicious purposes.

Now, after collecting system information and sending it to the C2 server, the threat actor needs to maintain control over the compromised system. This involves keeping the communication channel open and stealthy to avoid detection by network security measures.

Using external proxy techniques, such as compromising residential endpoints to relay command traffic, is a method to obfuscate the origin of the commands and make it harder for defenders to trace back to the actual C2 server. Residential endpoints are often less monitored and can provide a layer of anonymity because they are associated with innocent users.

So, is it likely that POWERSHOWER would use such techniques?

Well, sophisticated threat groups often employ various methods to hide their C2 communications. Using proxies, especially those that are part of a botnet consisting of compromised residential devices, can be an effective way to mask the true location of the C2 server and make attribution more difficult.

Moreover, residential IP addresses are less likely to be blocked or monitored closely by organizations, which can help sustain the C2 channel over a longer period.

However, setting up and managing such a proxy network requires additional resources and capabilities. The threat actor needs to have already compromised residential endpoints, which might not always be the case.

But given that POWERSHOWER is likely a sophisticated group, it's plausible that they have the capabilities to compromise residential devices and use them as proxies.

Additionally, using such proxies can help vary the source IP addresses of C2 communications, making it harder for defenders to correlate and block the traffic.

Therefore, from a tactical perspective, using external proxies for C2 communications makes sense for a threat group aiming to remain stealthy and persistent.

Given this analysis, I think the answer is "Yes," it is likely that POWERSHOWER would use external proxy techniques to maintain C2.
