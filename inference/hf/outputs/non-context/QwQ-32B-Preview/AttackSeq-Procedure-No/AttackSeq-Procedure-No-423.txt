So I've got this question here about a cyber attack sequence, and I need to figure out if the described series of events is likely to happen in the way it's outlined. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the attack starts with initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. That makes senseâ€”phishing is a common method for getting malicious content onto a victim's system. So, the bad guys send an email with an attachment that looks innocent but is actually designed to compromise the system.

Next, there's mention of an "encoded PowerShell script" that will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. So, in the context of a malicious Word document, it's common for attackers to use macros to execute code. VBS stands for Visual Basic Script, which is another scripting language that can be used for automation and, in this case, for malicious purposes.

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. Victim receives a phishing email with a malicious Word document.

2. Victim opens the document and enables macros (perhaps because they're tricked into thinking it's necessary to view the content properly).

3. The VBS macro inside the document executes.

4. This macro retrieves and decodes the PowerShell script.

5. The PowerShell script is then executed, which downloads additional payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Now, the question is asking if it's likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download these payloads.

Let's think about this. In many malware delivery chains, especially those involving document-based attacks, the sequence often involves:

- A malicious document with macros enabled.

- The macro executes a script, often PowerShell, to download and execute additional payloads.

So, the general flow matches what's described in the question.

Ursnif and GandCrab are both types of malware: Ursnif is a banking trojan, and GandCrab was a ransomware variant. Both can be delivered through similar infection chains.

Now, regarding the timing of when the PowerShell script executes. The question says it will execute "only before being retrieved via a VBS macro." This phrasing is a bit confusing. Typically, the macro would retrieve the PowerShell script and then execute it. So, the execution happens after retrieval.

But the question says "execute only before being retrieved." That sounds like a typo or miswording. Maybe it's meant to say that the script is encoded and needs to be retrieved and decoded by the macro before execution.

Given that, let's assume the correct sequence is:

- Macro is enabled.

- Macro retrieves the encoded PowerShell script.

- Macro decodes the script.

- Macro executes the decoded PowerShell script.

- The PowerShell script then downloads the Ursnif and GandCrab payloads.

This sequence is quite plausible and aligns with many real-world attack scenarios.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the plausibility of the sequence described, I would choose A: Yes, it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will be retrieved via a VBS macro and then execute to download the specified payloads.

However, I should consider if there are any reasons why this might not be the case.

First, modern security defenses are getting better at detecting malicious macros and PowerShell usage. So, it's possible that such an attack might be blocked by up-to-date security software.

Second, users are increasingly aware of the risks of enabling macros in documents from unknown sources. So, the success rate of such phishing attempts might be lower if users are cautious.

But, despite these potential drawbacks, it's still a common and effective method for attackers, especially against less security-savvy users.

Additionally, the specific mention of Ursnif and GandCrab suggests that this is a targeted attack, as these are specific types of malware. Attackers might tailor their delivery mechanisms to avoid detection and ensure successful infection.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the plausibility of the attack sequence, the answer should be A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
