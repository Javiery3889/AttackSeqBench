I've got this question here about APT28 and their tactics. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that APT28 uses crafted modules like "pr.dll" to upload stolen information to their command and control (C&C) server. It then asks if it's likely that APT28 will divide files into chunks of 0x1000000 bytes or more, especially when targeting political figures and the aerospace industry.

So, I need to think about APT28's known behaviors and see if dividing large files into smaller chunks aligns with their modus operandi, particularly in the contexts mentioned.

First off, who is APT28? APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, and Strontium, is a Russian-based advanced persistent threat group. They're known for their state-sponsored activities, often targeting government entities, think tanks, political organizations, and, in some cases, the aerospace industry.

Now, regarding their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), APT28 has been observed using a variety of methods to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data from target networks. One of their notable techniques is the use of custom malware and tools, which might include modules like the "pr.dll" mentioned in the question.

Exfiltrating large amounts of data can be risky and may attract attention if not done carefully. Dividing large files into smaller chunks can help evade detection by security systems that monitor for large data transfers. This technique is known as "data fragmentation" or "chunking."

So, does APT28 employ such techniques? From what I've read in various threat reports and analyses, APT groups, including APT28, often use data fragmentation to make exfiltration less conspicuous. This aligns with the need to remain undetected for as long as possible.

Moreover, targeting political figures and the aerospace industry makes sense given APT28's known interests. Political targets can provide insights into foreign policy, diplomatic relations, and political strategies, which are valuable for intelligence-gathering purposes. The aerospace industry, on the other hand, may hold sensitive technological and defense-related information that could be of interest to a state actor.

Given this background, it seems plausible that APT28 would divide large files into smaller chunks, such as 0x1000000 bytes (which is 16 MB), to exfiltrate data more stealthily, especially when targeting sensitive sectors like politics and aerospace.

Therefore, considering their known tactics and the nature of their targets, the answer would be "Yes," it is likely that APT28 will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more when targeting political figures and the aerospace industry.

**Final Answer: A**
