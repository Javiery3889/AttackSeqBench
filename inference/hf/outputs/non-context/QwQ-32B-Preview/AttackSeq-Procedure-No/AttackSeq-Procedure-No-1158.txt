To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question describes an attack scenario where attackers impersonate technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages. These messages claim copyright violations or offer verified badges, which are likely social engineering tactics to trick victims into divulging sensitive information or granting access to their accounts.

Next, the question asks whether, after performing these initial phishing attacks, it is likely that the attackers will target various collaboration tools like Slack, Teams, JIRA, or Confluence. The purpose is to hunt for exposed credentials before locking out the original owners by changing account passwords.

Let's consider the motivations and typical behaviors of attackers in such scenarios.

1. **Initial Phishing Attack:**
   - The goal here is to gain initial access or credentials from the victim.
   - By impersonating trusted entities and using social engineering, attackers aim to lower the victim's defenses and convince them to take specific actions, such as clicking on malicious links or providing login credentials.

2. **Targeting Collaboration Tools:**
   - Once the attackers have gained access to a victim's account, especially if it's an email account or a work-related account, they might look for opportunities to expand their access and cause more damage.
   - Collaboration tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, JIRA, and Confluence are central to many organizations' operations. They often contain sensitive information, including credentials, project details, and communication records.
   - Accessing these tools can provide attackers with valuable data and the ability to move laterally within the organization.

3. **Hunting for Exposed Credentials:**
   - Attackers are likely to search for any stored credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information within these collaboration tools.
   - This information can be used to gain access to other systems or to perform more targeted attacks within the organization.

4. **Locking Out Original Owners:**
   - After gathering the necessary information, attackers might change account passwords to lock out the original owners. This action prevents the victims from regaining access and potentially alerts the organization to the breach.

Given this sequence of events, it is indeed plausible that attackers would target collaboration tools after a successful phishing attack. These tools are rich sources of information and control within an organization, making them high-value targets for attackers looking to maximize their gains from a breach.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
