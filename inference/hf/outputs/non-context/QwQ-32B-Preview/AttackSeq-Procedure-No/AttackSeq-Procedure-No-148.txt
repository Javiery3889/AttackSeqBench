To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the establishment of command and control (C2) via a one-way communication method using GitLab and Digital Point is plausible.

First, let's break down the sequence of events mentioned in the question:

1. **Accessing Shared Folders via SMB:** TG1021 gained access to shared folders on internal web servers using compromised domain credentials over SMB (Server Message Block). This is a common technique used by attackers to move laterally within a network.

2. **Dropping Web Shell Loader:** They dropped the "NodeIISWeb" web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement. Web shells are malicious scripts that allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a web server.

Now, the question is whether it's likely that they established C2 using a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point.

**Understanding C2 Communication:**

Command and control (C2) is essential for attackers to manage their compromised systems and exfiltrate data. C2 channels can be bidirectional or one-way. A one-way communication method typically implies that the C2 server sends commands to the compromised systems, but the systems do not respond back directly, which can help evade detection.

**Evaluating the Use of GitLab and Digital Point:**

GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager, offering source code management along with features like issue tracking, continuous integration, and continuous deployment. Digital Point is a platform that offers various services, including hosting and domain registration.

Using these platforms for C2 could involve several techniques:

- **Git Repositories for C2:** Attackers can use Git repositories to store and retrieve commands. For example, they can push commits containing encoded commands, and the compromised systems can pull these commits to get new instructions.

- **One-Way Communication:** In a one-way communication setup, the C2 server pushes commands, and the compromised systems only pull the commands without sending any data back, except perhaps for acknowledgments or status updates.

Given this context, let's consider the plausibility:

- **Plausibility of Using GitLab for C2:** It's known that attackers use version control systems like Git for C2 purposes. This technique, often referred to as "Git-to-C2," allows for a stealthy and low-and-slow communication method that can blend in with normal network traffic.

- **One-Way Communication:** If the compromised systems only pull commands from the Git repository and do not push any data back, this constitutes a one-way communication method. This can make detection more difficult because there are no outgoing beaconing signals that might trigger alerts.

- **Involvement of Digital Point:** Digital Point could be used for hosting the Git repository or for domain fronting to mask the C2 traffic. Domain fronting involves making requests to a domain that is different from the one being hosted, which can help evade network filters.

Given these points, it is plausible that TG1021 established C2 using a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the answer is likely "Yes," as using GitLab and Digital Point for one-way C2 communication is a feasible and stealthy approach for attackers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
