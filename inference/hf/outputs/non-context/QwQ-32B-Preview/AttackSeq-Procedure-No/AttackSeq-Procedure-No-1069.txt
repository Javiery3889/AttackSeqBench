To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the steps mentioned are logically connected in a typical cyber attack scenario, specifically related to the Tropic Trooper and Equation Group activities.

First, let's break down the components mentioned in the question:

1. **Tropic Trooper**: This is a cyber threat group associated with Vietnamese espionage activities. They are known for using various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to infiltrate targets, often related to political and military interests.

2. **Malicious DLL backdoor injected into dllhost.exe**: DLLhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used to host out-of-process COM servers. Injecting a malicious DLL into this process can allow attackers to execute code within the context of this trusted process, making it harder to detect.

3. **FakeRun loader**: This is a loader used by the Equation Group, another sophisticated threat actor associated with the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). FakeRun is known for its ability to load and execute additional payloads.

4. **Equation Editor exploits**: These are vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Equation Editor, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

5. **Installer package with malicious payloads**: This refers to a package that contains malicious software, likely designed to perform specific actions once executed on the target system.

Now, let's consider the sequence of events as described in the question:

- Tropic Trooper injects a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

- After using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

- Is Tropic Trooper likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe only after these steps?

To evaluate this, I need to consider the relationships and dependencies between these components.

First, Tropic Trooper is associated with Vietnamese espionage, while FakeRun is associated with the Equation Group, linked to the NSA. These are two different threat groups with different objectives and tools. It's unusual for one group to use tools specifically attributed to another, especially given the attribution to nation-states.

Second, the sequence suggests that Equation Editor exploits are used to execute an installer package, which presumably contains the malicious payloads, including the DLL backdoor. Then, after this, FakeRun is used to launch dllhost.exe.

However, considering that FakeRun is a loader used by the Equation Group, it's unlikely that Tropic Trooper would use FakeRun, given the different affiliations. Moreover, the sequence seems a bit convoluted. Typically, an exploit would be used to execute a payload directly, and then that payload would carry out further actions, such as downloading additional modules or establishing backdoors.

Injecting a DLL into dllhost.exe is a common technique for maintaining persistence and executing code in the context of a trusted process. However, the use of FakeRun in this sequence doesn't align well with the known TTPs of Tropic Trooper.

Given this analysis, it seems improbable that Tropic Trooper would use FakeRun in this manner, especially considering the tools' associations with different threat groups.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
