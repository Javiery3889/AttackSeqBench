So I've got this question here about phishing attacks and how attackers might adapt their tactics to evade security measures. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that attackers are using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. This makes sense because email filters and security software often scan for specific keywords or patterns in the text of emails to identify phishing attempts. By using images, attackers can bypass these text-based detection mechanisms since the images don't contain text that can be scanned for suspicious content.

Now, the question is asking whether, after employing this tactic, it's likely that attackers will gather account credentials via a keylogger plugin instead of verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code.

So, let's understand the difference between these two approaches:

1. **Gathering credentials via a keylogger plugin:** This involves installing a piece of malware on the victim's device that records keystrokes, thereby capturing usernames, passwords, and potentially 2-step verification codes as the user types them in.

2. **Verifying credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code:** This approach typically involves setting up a fake login page that mimics a legitimate one. When the victim enters their credentials, the attackers immediately verify them against the legitimate service. If the credentials are correct, the fake page may then prompt the victim to enter their 2-step verification code, thereby capturing it as well.

Both methods aim to capture sensitive information, but they differ in how they achieve this.

Given that the attackers have already adapted their phishing emails by using images to evade detection, we need to consider whether they are likely to continue with more sophisticated tactics or switch to a different method.

Using a keylogger plugin introduces an additional layer of complexity because it requires successfully installing malware on the victim's device. This can be more challenging and may require social engineering to convince the victim to download and install the plugin, which could raise suspicions.

On the other hand, the real-time verification method relies on the victim interacting with a fake login page and entering their credentials and 2-step verification code directly into that page. This method doesn't require installing any software on the victim's device, making it potentially less risky and easier to execute.

Considering the initial adaptation of using images in phishing emails, which is a tactic to evade email filters, it seems that the attackers are already employing methods to bypass security measures. However, installing a keylogger plugin would require further actions from the victim and could be more easily detected, especially if the device has antivirus software or if the user is cautious.

Therefore, it might be less likely that attackers would choose to gather credentials via a keylogger plugin after already adapting their phishing emails. Instead, they might prefer to continue with methods that don't require installing additional software, such as the real-time verification approach.

Moreover, using a keylogger plugin could be seen as overkill for the purpose of capturing login credentials and 2-step verification codes. The real-time verification method is more straightforward and directly achieves the same goal without the need for additional steps.

In conclusion, it's less likely that attackers would switch to gathering credentials via a keylogger plugin after adapting their phishing emails to use images. They are more likely to continue with methods that don't require installing software on the victim's device.

**Final Answer: B**
