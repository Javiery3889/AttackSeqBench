To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the context provided in the question. The adversaries have used reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager to evade defenses. Reflective code loading is a technique where malware loads itself into memory without writing to disk, which helps evade detection by security software that monitors file system activities. The Empire framework is a post-exploitation tool that allows attackers to maintain access and control over compromised systems.

The question then asks whether, after establishing connectivity and relaying victim information to primary C2 servers, the adversaries are likely to use secondary C2 servers for communication.

Let's consider why adversaries might use secondary C2 servers:

1. **Redundancy:** In case the primary C2 server is taken down or becomes unavailable, secondary servers ensure that the communication channel remains open.

2. **Evasion:** Using multiple C2 servers can help evade detection by security systems that may have flagged the primary server.

3. **Compartmentalization:** Different C2 servers can be used for different stages of the attack or for different types of commands, adding an extra layer of complexity and making it harder for defenders to understand the full scope of the attack.

4. **Geographical Distribution:** Having C2 servers in different locations can help the attackers maintain communication regardless of where the victim is located, potentially improving response times and reliability.

Given that the adversaries have already employed sophisticated techniques like reflective code loading and are using the Empire framework, it is reasonable to assume that they are likely to have a well-planned command and control structure.

Empire, being a post-exploitation framework, supports the use of multiple C2 servers and communication channels. It is designed to be resilient against takedown attempts and to evade network defenses.

Therefore, it is plausible that after establishing initial connectivity and relaying victim information to primary C2 servers, adversaries using Empire would set up secondary C2 servers as a backup or for further communication.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the above reasoning, the most likely answer is "Yes," as using secondary C2 servers aligns with best practices for maintaining persistent access and evading detection.

**Final Answer: A**
