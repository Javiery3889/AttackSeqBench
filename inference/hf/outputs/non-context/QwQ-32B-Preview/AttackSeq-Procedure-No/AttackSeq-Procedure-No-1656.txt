So I've got this question here about the FHAPPI campaign, which sounds like some kind of cyber attack. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, there's an APT phishing email that contains a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website. Geocities, that's like way back in the day, right? I remember that from the 90s. So, it's interesting that they're using an old hosting service for this.

Then, there's a VBScript that gets downloaded and opens a .doc file, which ends up getting executed. So, it seems like the malware is delivered through a Word document. Maybe it's using some exploit in Word to run malicious code.

Now, the question is asking whether, after all this, the malware is likely to install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.

Okay, so first things first: cron is a job scheduler in Unix-based systems, like Linux or macOS. It's used to schedule tasks to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. So, if the malware is installing itself as a cron job, that means it's targeting Unix-based systems.

On the other hand, PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, primarily used on Windows systems. So, using PowerShell would suggest the malware is targeting Windows machines.

Given that, the choice between using cron and PowerShell would depend on the operating system the malware is trying to infect.

But wait, earlier in the attack sequence, there's a VBScript and a .doc file. VBScript is typically associated with Windows, and Word documents can be opened on both Windows and macOS, but exploits in Word are more common on Windows, especially with older versions of Office.

However, the question mentions using the cron utility, which is Unix-based, but the initial delivery mechanism seems geared towards Windows.

This is a bit confusing. Maybe the malware is cross-platform and can adapt to the system it's running on. But that seems a bit advanced for a campaign that's using Geocities and VBScript, which seem a bit outdated.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack is targeting macOS or Linux systems, and they're using a Word document as a delivery mechanism. It's possible, but less common, because Windows is still more prevalent.

Let me think about the sequence again:

1. Phishing email with a link to malware on Geocities.

2. VBScript downloads and opens a .doc file.

3. The .doc file contains some exploit that executes malicious code.

4. The question is whether the malware is likely to install itself as a cron job instead of using PowerShell.

Given that VBScript is a Windows technology, and cron is a Unix technology, it seems like there's a mismatch here. Maybe the malware is designed to work on both Windows and Unix-based systems, but that seems unlikely for this kind of campaign.

Alternatively, perhaps the malware is using a technique to execute on both platforms, but again, it seems improbable.

Another possibility is that the question is testing whether I know that cron is a Unix utility and PowerShell is a Windows utility, and in this case, given the Windows-oriented initial attack vector, it's unlikely that the malware would switch to using cron.

Wait, but the question says "instead of using PowerShell for further execution." So, it's suggesting that perhaps the malware could use either cron or PowerShell for persistence or further execution steps.

Given that the initial attack seems targeted at Windows (VBScript, .doc file), it's more likely that the malware would use PowerShell for further execution on the same Windows system, rather than switching to cron, which is for Unix-based systems.

Unless, of course, the malware is designed to move laterally to other systems within the network, and some of those systems are Unix-based. But that seems like a more advanced scenario.

Moreover, using cron would require the malware to first compromise a Unix-based system and have the necessary permissions to edit cron jobs.

Given the information provided, it seems more plausible that the malware would continue to use Windows-specific technologies, like PowerShell, for further execution on the initially compromised Windows machine.

Therefore, the answer should be "No," it is not likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job instead of using PowerShell.

Wait, but let's consider another angle. Maybe the malware is designed to be cross-platform, and after compromising a Windows machine, it looks for other systems on the network and deploys itself accordingly.

However, that seems like a more sophisticated approach, and the initial attack vector seems rather rudimentary (using Geocities and VBScript). So, it's perhaps less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the malware is being executed on a Unix-based system, and the .doc file is a red herring, but that doesn't align with the VBScript part, which is Windows-specific.

I think the most reasonable conclusion is that the malware is targeted at Windows systems and would use Windows-specific tools like PowerShell for further execution, rather than cron.

So, the answer should be "No."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{B: No}} \]
