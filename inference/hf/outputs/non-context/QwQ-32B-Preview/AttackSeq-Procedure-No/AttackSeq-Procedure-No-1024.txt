So I've got this question here about some backdoors and their communication with command and control servers. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions "PyFlash backdoor" and says it gathers OS-related information from the infected machine and sends it to the C&C server. Then it asks whether NetFlash and PyFlash will likely use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers, and specifically mentions asymmetric cryptography.

Okay, so I need to think about how malware typically communicates with its C&C servers. Using HTTPS would make sense because it provides encryption, which helps hide the traffic from network monitoring tools. Asymmetric cryptography is also a common practice for securing communications.

But the question is a bit confusing because it mentions both NetFlash and PyFlash. I need to know if they are different pieces of malware or related. Assuming they are related or similar in functionality, it's plausible that they would use similar communication methods.

Now, looking at the answer choices: A: Yes and B: No.

I need to decide which one is more likely based on the information provided.

Given that HTTPS is a standard way to encrypt web communications and that malware often uses it to avoid detection, I would say that it's likely they use HTTPS.

Moreover, asymmetric cryptography is a fundamental part of HTTPS, as it's used for key exchange and authentication.

So, based on that, I think the answer should be A: Yes.

But let me double-check. Is there any reason why they wouldn't use HTTPS? Well, if they wanted to be really stealthy, they might use other protocols or even encrypt their traffic in a non-standard way. However, implementing HTTPS is straightforward and provides good security, so it's a reasonable choice for malware authors.

Also, considering that the question specifies "asymmetric cryptography," which is indeed used in HTTPS for operations like establishing a secure connection, it aligns well with the use of HTTPS.

Therefore, I don't see any red flags that would make me choose B: No.

In conclusion, I think the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
