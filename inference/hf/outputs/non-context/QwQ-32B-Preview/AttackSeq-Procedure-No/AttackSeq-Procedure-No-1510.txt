To answer this question, I need to analyze whether the Carbanak group, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) actor, is likely to have used LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to map an organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials, followed by compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

First, let's understand the techniques mentioned:

1. **LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning**: These are name resolution protocols used in Windows environments. Attackers can exploit these protocols to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing them to capture plaintext credentials when users attempt to access network resources.

2. **SMB Relay Attacks**: Server Message Block (SMB) is a protocol used for sharing access to resources such as files, printers, etc. In a relay attack, an attacker captures authentication credentials from one connection and relays them to another service to gain unauthorized access.

3. **Compromising Domain Administrator Credentials**: Domain Administrators have high-level privileges in Active Directory environments. Compromising their credentials can provide extensive control over the network.

4. **Compromising Additional Endpoints**: Once an initial foothold is established, attackers often move laterally within the network to compromise more systems and expand their access.

Now, considering the Carbanak group:

- Carbanak is known for targeting financial institutions and has been active since at least 2013.

- Their tactics typically involve long-term surveillance and data exfiltration.

- They are known to use various sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.

Given this background, let's evaluate the likelihood of them using the mentioned techniques:

- **LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: These are common techniques used by attackers to harvest credentials in Windows environments. Since Carbanak targets organizations with Windows-based infrastructures, it is plausible that they would use these methods to gain initial access or to escalate privileges.

- **Mapping the Internal Network**: After gaining initial access, mapping the network is a standard procedure for attackers to understand the environment and identify high-value targets.

- **Collecting Administrative-Level Credentials**: Once inside, targeting and obtaining high-level credentials like Domain Administrator is a strategic move to gain broader control over the network.

- **Compromising Additional Endpoints**: With elevated credentials, moving laterally to other systems is a typical step in advancing the attack objectives.

Given this sequence, it aligns with standard APT attack patterns, and there is no indication that Carbanak does not employ such tactics.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
