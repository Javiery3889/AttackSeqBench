So I've got this question here about the Nemesis bootkit and how it might evade detection after infecting a system's Volume Boot Record (VBR). The question is asking whether, after achieving persistence through the VBR infection, the malware is likely to evade detection by placing its install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. The answer choices are simply "A: Yes" and "B: No." Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what a bootkit is and how it works, especially in the context of the Nemesis bootkit. A bootkit is a type of malware that infects the boot process of a computer, which allows it to gain low-level access to the system and persist across reboots. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) is a critical component of a storage device that contains code to start the boot process. By infecting the VBR, the bootkit can execute its own code before the operating system even loads, which makes it particularly stealthy and difficult to detect and remove.

Now, the question is about whether, after achieving this persistence via VBR infection, the malware is likely to further evade detection by placing its installation files into directories that are excluded from scanning. So, I need to think about two main aspects here: the persistence mechanism and the evasion technique.

First, persistence through VBR infection is a sophisticated method that already provides a high level of stealth. The VBR is not typically scanned by antivirus software because it's a low-level system component, and modifying it could indicate either malware or legitimate system changes, such as those made by security software or system utilities.

Second, placing files in directories excluded from scanning is another evasion technique. Antivirus software often has a list of directories or files that it skips during scans to improve performance or to avoid false positives. These might include system directories, temporary folders, or other areas where frequent changes are expected.

So, considering that the Nemesis bootkit has already infected the VBR for persistence, is it likely that it would also employ the tactic of placing its files in excluded directories to further evade detection?

Well, malware often uses multiple layers of evasion techniques to maximize its chances of remaining undetected. Since the bootkit has already achieved a low-level persistence, adding an additional layer of file-based evasion could be beneficial. By placing its files in directories that antivirus software doesn't scan, the malware reduces the likelihood of being detected through file scans.

However, I need to consider whether this is a likely approach for a bootkit like Nemesis. Bootkits operate at a very low level, often below the operating system, and their code may not be stored in traditional file systems but rather in sectors of the disk that are not accessible or visible to the operating system once it has booted. So, in that case, the concept of placing files in specific directories might not directly apply.

Alternatively, the bootkit might have components that operate above the boot level, within the operating system, and those components could benefit from being stored in less-scanned directories.

Given that, it seems plausible that the malware could use both techniques: infecting the VBR for persistence and storing its files in less-scanned directories to evade detection.

But, I need to think about whether this is likely. The question is asking about likelihood, not just possibility. So, I need to consider how common it is for bootkits to use multiple evasion techniques.

From what I know about malware behavior, it's quite common for advanced malware to use multiple layers of obfuscation and evasion. Bootkits, being sophisticated malware, are likely to employ a variety of techniques to stay under the radar.

Therefore, it is likely that after achieving persistence through VBR infection, the Nemesis bootkit would also place its installation files into directories that are excluded from scanning to further evade detection.

So, based on this reasoning, the answer should be "A: Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
