So I've got this question here about a spear-phishing attack that used a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to get into a system. The exploit is CVE-2015-5119, and there's a Flash file called 'show.swf' involved, which is supposed to execute some shellcode. The question is asking whether it's likely that this 'show.swf' file will attempt to execute shellcode for defense evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in a GIF image.

Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events in this attack:

1. **Spear-phishing attack**: This is a targeted phishing attack where the attacker sends personalized emails to specific individuals, often posing as a trusted entity, to trick them into opening an attachment or clicking on a link.

2. **Malicious Adobe Flash exploit**: The attachment in the phishing email likely contains a Flash file that exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player.

3. **Exploiting CVE-2015-5119**: This is a specific vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that was patched in 2015. It's a use-after-free vulnerability that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

4. **Flash file 'show.swf'**: This is the malicious Flash file that contains the exploit code.

5. **Execute shellcode for defense evasion**: Shellcode is a small piece of code that performs a specific action, often used in exploits to execute commands on the target system. Defense evasion techniques are used by attackers to avoid detection and analysis.

6. **Install payload embedded in GIF image**: The payload is the actual malicious code that the attacker wants to run on the target system, and it's embedded within a GIF image.

Now, the question is asking whether the 'show.swf' file will attempt to execute shellcode for defense evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

To answer this, I need to consider the typical sequence of events in such an attack.

Usually, in an exploit chain:

- The exploit (in this case, the Flash file exploiting CVE-2015-5119) gains initial access to the system.

- Once the exploit is successful, it executes shellcode that performs initial actions, such as establishing a connection back to the attacker's server, downloading additional payloads, or performing defense evasion techniques to hide its presence.

- Defense evasion techniques might include things like disabling security software, creating backdoors, or modifying system settings to avoid detection.

- The payload, which is the ultimate goal of the attack, is then installed and executed.

Given this sequence, it's more likely that the shellcode executed by the exploit would first perform defense evasion techniques to ensure that the system remains compromised and undetected, and then proceed to install the payload.

However, the question specifies that the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image and then attempts defense evasion.

This seems a bit counterintuitive because, in most attack sequences, attackers prefer to establish a foothold and evade defenses before deploying the main payload. This is to ensure that the payload can operate without being immediately detected and removed.

But let's consider the possibility that the payload is embedded in a GIF image. Perhaps the attacker wants to install the payload first and then have the shellcode perform defense evasion steps to protect the payload.

Alternatively, maybe the shellcode installs the payload and then performs defense evasion to cover its tracks.

Another perspective is that the shellcode might install the payload and then execute additional shellcode for defense evasion.

Given these possibilities, I need to decide which sequence is most plausible.

Option A says "Yes," meaning it's likely that the 'show.swf' file will attempt to execute shellcode for defense evasion only after installing the payload.

Option B says "No," meaning it's not likely.

Based on my understanding of typical attack sequences, I would say that defense evasion techniques are usually employed early on to establish a foothold and avoid detection before installing the main payload.

Therefore, it's less likely that the shellcode would install the payload first and then perform defense evasion.

Hence, I think the answer is "No," it's not likely that the 'show.swf' file will attempt to execute shellcode for defense evasion only after installing the payload.

So, my final answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
