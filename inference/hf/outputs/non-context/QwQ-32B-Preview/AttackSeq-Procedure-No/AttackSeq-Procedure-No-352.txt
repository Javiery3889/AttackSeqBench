To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the specified actions are plausible given the context.

First, let's break down the attack sequence:

1. **Initial Access:** The attack begins with weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158. This CVE is related to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows remote code execution.

2. **Payload Delivery:** The exploitation drops an embedded downloader file. This suggests that the initial payload is designed to fetch additional malware from a remote location.

3. **Malware Execution:** The malware in question is MSIL/Crimson, which is a .NET-based malware.

4. **Actions Before C2 Communication:** The question asks whether it's likely that this malware will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing command and control (C2) using a custom TCP protocol.

Now, let's consider each part of this sequence and see how they relate to each other.

**Understanding MSIL/Crimson:**

MSIL stands for Microsoft Intermediate Language, which is used in .NET applications. Therefore, MSIL/Crimson is a .NET-based malware. This is important because .NET applications have different characteristics and capabilities compared to native Windows executables.

**Native Windows Functions:**

The functions mentioned, GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo, are Windows API functions. GetFileAttributesW is used to retrieve attributes of a file, and GetSystemInfo provides information about the current system, such as the amount of physical memory and the number of processors.

**Why Would Malware Use These Functions?**

Malware often gathers information about the target system to tailor its actions accordingly. For example:

- **GetFileAttributesW:** Could be used to check if certain files or directories exist, which might indicate the presence of specific software or configurations that the malware is interested in.

- **GetSystemInfo:** Helps the malware understand the capabilities of the system, such as the amount of memory or the number of processors, which could influence how the malware operates or what payloads it deploys.

**Establishing C2 Communication:**

After gathering necessary information, the malware establishes communication with its command and control server using a custom TCP protocol. This is a common step in malware operation, allowing the attacker to send commands and receive data from the infected system.

**Is It Likely?**

Given the context, it is indeed likely that MSIL/Crimson would execute such native Windows functions before establishing C2 communication. Here's why:

1. **Information Gathering:** Malware often performs reconnaissance on the compromised system to make informed decisions about its next steps.

2. **Customization of Attack:** By knowing details about the system, the malware can customize its behavior to avoid detection or to maximize its impact.

3. **Resource Management:** Understanding the system's resources helps the malware manage its operations efficiently without overloading the system, which could lead to detection.

4. **Compatibility Checks:** Certain actions or payloads may only be compatible with specific system configurations. Checking system attributes ensures that the malware operates correctly.

**Technical Feasibility:**

Since MSIL/Crimson is a .NET-based malware, it can interact with native Windows APIs through P/Invoke (Platform Invoke), which allows .NET code to call unmanaged DLLs, including kernel32.dll and other system libraries that contain functions like GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the typical behavior of malware and the technical feasibility of executing these functions within a .NET environment, it is plausible that MSIL/Crimson would execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing C2 communication using a custom TCP protocol.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
