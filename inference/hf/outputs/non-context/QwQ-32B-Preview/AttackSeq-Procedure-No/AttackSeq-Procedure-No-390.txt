So I've got this question here about threat actors using a technique called AtomBombing to inject malicious code into legitimate programs on Windows. Then it asks if, after doing that, they are likely to use a VBA script embedded in a malicious Word document as part of their strategy. The options are yes or no.

First, I need to understand what AtomBombing is. From what I know, AtomBombing is a method that threat actors use to inject code into another process without writing to the target process's address space. It leverages the atom tables in Windows, which are global tables stored in the kernel that processes can use to share data. By placing malicious code into an atom table and then executing it in the context of another process, attackers can achieve code injection in a way that's hard to detect because no traditional injection techniques like WriteProcessMemory are used.

Now, the question is about whether, after using AtomBombing, threat actors would likely use a VBA script embedded in a Word document as part of their strategy. VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications, and it's a scripting language that's been around for a long time, used in various Microsoft Office applications, including Word.

VBA scripts can be malicious; they can perform a wide range of actions, from simple macro activities to more complex tasks like downloading and executing malware. Malicious Word documents often contain VBA macros that, when enabled by the user, can carry out these actions.

So, the question is essentially asking if, after using AtomBombing to inject code into a process, threat actors would also use a VBA script in a Word document as part of their attack sequence.

To answer this, I need to think about how these two techniques fit together in an attack scenario.

First, AtomBombing is a code injection technique that's typically used after gaining some level of access to a system. It's a way for malware that's already running on a system to escalate its privileges or to hide its presence by injecting code into legitimate processes.

On the other hand, using a VBA script in a Word document is often an initial infection vector. Attackers might send a phishing email with a malicious Word document attached, and when the user opens the document and enables the macros, the VBA script runs and downloads and executes malware.

So, in a typical attack sequence, the use of a VBA script in a Word document would come before the use of AtomBombing. The VBA script would be the initial entry point, used to get the malicious code onto the system and executing, and then, once that code is running, it might use techniques like AtomBombing to further compromise the system.

Given that, it seems unlikely that threat actors would use a VBA script in a Word document after using AtomBombing, because AtomBombing is something that's done after the initial infection and execution of malware on the system.

Moreover, once malware is running on a system with sufficient privileges, it doesn't need to rely on user interaction to enable macros in a Word document to execute code. The malware can carry out its activities directly.

Therefore, it doesn't make much sense for threat actors to use a VBA script in a Word document after they've already used AtomBombing to inject code into processes.

So, my answer would be "No," it is not likely that they will use a VBA script embedded in a malicious Word document as part of their strategy after using AtomBombing.

But let me think about this a bit more to make sure.

Perhaps there are scenarios where threat actors might use a VBA script after using AtomBombing. For example, maybe they use AtomBombing to inject code into a process, and then that injected code somehow interacts with a Word document that contains a VBA script.

However, that seems convoluted. Normally, the initial infection vector, like a malicious Word document with a VBA script, is used to get the malware onto the system, and then the malware uses various techniques, like AtomBombing, to further its objectives.

I can't think of a realistic scenario where, after using AtomBombing, threat actors would then use a VBA script in a Word document as part of their strategy.

Therefore, I believe the correct answer is "No."

**Final Answer**
