To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the actions mentioned in the execution phase logically follow from the command and control phase as described.

First, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. **Command and Control Phase:**
   - A downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.

2. **Execution Phase:**
   - PowerShell scripts download a Windows executable and a decoy document.

I need to determine if it is likely that after retrieving the encoded malware in an image file, the next step would involve PowerShell scripts downloading additional files.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Command and Control Phase:**
   - The downloader retrieves an image file with encoded Asruex malware. This suggests that the malware is being delivered disguised as an image to evade detection.
   - Asruex is a type of malware, and the fact that it's encoded indicates an attempt to obfuscate its true nature.

2. **Role of PowerShell in Malware Execution:**
   - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often used by attackers for executing commands and downloading additional payloads because it is commonly allowed in enterprise environments.
   - It's common for initial malware droppers to use PowerShell to download and execute further stages of an attack.

3. **Sequence of Actions:**
   - After retrieving the encoded malware, it's plausible that the next step would involve executing this malware.
   - Asruex malware might include functionality to download additional components, such as a Windows executable and a decoy document, to carry out its objectives.

4. **Purpose of Additional Downloads:**
   - The Windows executable could be the main payload that performs the malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or establishing a backdoor.
   - The decoy document is likely used to distract the user or security personnel, making it seem like the system is compromised by something less sinister or diverting attention from the actual malicious activity.

5. **Likelihood of Sequence:**
   - It is common in malware operations for an initial downloader to fetch and execute additional payloads in stages.
   - Using PowerShell for these operations is standard practice among attackers due to its flexibility and prevalence in enterprise environments.

### Conclusion:

Given the sequence of events and the typical modus operandi of malware operations, it is likely that after retrieving the encoded Asruex malware in an image file, PowerShell scripts would be used to download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
