So I've got this question here about a spear-phishing attack that used a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to get into a system. The exploit is CVE-2015-5119, and there's a Flash file called 'show.swf' involved. The question is asking whether it's likely that this Flash file will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs a payload embedded in a GIF image.

First, I need to break down the components here:

1. **Spear-phishing attack**: This is a targeted attempt to steal sensitive information by masquerading as a trusted entity. In this case, it's using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit.

2. **Malicious Adobe Flash exploit**: Specifically, it's exploiting CVE-2015-5119, which is a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that allows for arbitrary code execution.

3. **'show.swf' Flash file**: This is the malicious file that's being used to deliver the exploit.

4. **Downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes**: NTLM is a authentication protocol used in Windows environments. Downgrading NTLM can allow attackers to capture NTLM hashes, which can then be used for pass-the-hash attacks.

5. **Shellcode installs payload embedded in GIF image**: After gaining access, the shellcode will install another payload, which is embedded in a GIF image.

Now, the question is asking whether it's likely that 'show.swf' will perform the NTLM downgrade before installing the payload from the GIF.

To answer this, I need to think about the typical sequence of events in such an attack.

First, the attacker sends a spear-phishing email with a link or attachment that lures the victim into opening the malicious Flash file, 'show.swf'. Once the victim opens it, the exploit code within 'show.swf' takes advantage of CVE-2015-5119 to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.

At this point, the attacker has code execution on the victim's machine. The next step would typically be to establish a foothold and potentially move laterally within the network.

NTLM downgrade attacks are often used in scenarios where the attacker is on the same network as the victim and can intercept authentication traffic. By downgrading the NTLM version, the attacker can capture NTLM hashes, which can be reused for authentication elsewhere.

However, in this scenario, the initial access is through a spear-phishing email and a Flash exploit. The 'show.swf' file is likely to contain shellcode that will reach out to a command and control server to download additional payloads, such as the one embedded in the GIF image.

So, considering this sequence:

1. Spear-phishing email with 'show.swf' attachment.

2. Victim opens 'show.swf', exploiting CVE-2015-5119.

3. Shellcode from 'show.swf' executes, possibly establishing a connection to a C2 server.

4. The C2 server sends additional payloads, such as the one embedded in the GIF image.

Now, where does the NTLM downgrade fit into this sequence?

NTLM downgrade would typically happen when the attacker is positioned to intercept network traffic, such as on the same local network. It's not something that the initial exploit file ('show.swf') would perform immediately upon execution.

Instead, after gaining initial access, the attacker might use various techniques to move laterally within the network, which could include performing NTLM downgrade attacks to capture hashes from other machines.

Therefore, it doesn't seem likely that the 'show.swf' file itself would perform an NTLM downgrade as part of its initial execution. The primary goal of 'show.swf' is to exploit the vulnerability and deliver the shellcode, which then sets up the connection to the C2 server to download further payloads.

The payload embedded in the GIF image might contain additional functionality, such as tools for lateral movement, which could include capabilities for NTLM downgrade attacks.

So, in summary, the NTLM downgrade is more likely to be a subsequent step performed by later-stage payloads rather than being part of the initial 'show.swf' exploit.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
