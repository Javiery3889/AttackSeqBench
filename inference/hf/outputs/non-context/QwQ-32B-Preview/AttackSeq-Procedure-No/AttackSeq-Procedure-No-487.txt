So I've got this question here about a group called FamousSparrow and their tactics after gaining initial access through some vulnerabilities. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that they gain initial access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. So, they're getting into these systems through these vulnerabilities. That makes sense as these are common entry points for attackers.

Next, it says that after gaining initial access, they use cmd.exe to download and install something called SparrowDoor backdoor. Cmd.exe is the command interpreter in Windows, and it's often used by attackers to execute commands on a compromised system. Using cmd.exe to download and install a backdoor is a plausible step because it's a straightforward way to get malicious software onto the system.

Then, the question mentions that they acquire infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for resource development. This seems like they're setting up their own infrastructure to support their operations, which could include command and control servers, data storage, or other resources needed for their attacks.

Now, the question is asking whether it's likely that FamousSparrow would follow this sequence: gain initial access through vulnerabilities, use cmd.exe to download and install the backdoor, and then set up infrastructure for resource development.

Let's think about this in terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary tactics and techniques. Gaining initial access is Tactics TA0001, and using cmd.exe falls under Execution (T1059) and likely Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059.003). Downloading and installing the backdoor would involve techniques like Software Deployment (T1037) or Install Util (T1117), perhaps.

Setting up infrastructure for resource development might fall under Resource Development (TA0006), which includes activities like acquiring additional systems or capabilities to support the operation.

In terms of sequence, it makes sense that after gaining initial access, an adversary would want to establish persistent access, which is what installing a backdoor like SparrowDoor achieves. Then, setting up their own infrastructure for resource development would be a subsequent step to support their ongoing operations.

So, considering this sequence:

1. Initial Access

2. Execute cmd.exe to download and install backdoor

3. Set up infrastructure for resource development

This seems like a logical progression in an attack campaign.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the sequence making sense from a tactical perspective, I would choose A: Yes.

However, let's consider if there might be any reasons to choose B: No.

One might argue that setting up infrastructure for resource development could happen before the actual attack, meaning they might set up their infrastructure first and then use it to launch the initial access attempts. That could be a valid point, but the question specifies that acquiring infrastructure is part of the sequence after gaining initial access and installing the backdoor.

Another consideration is that using cmd.exe to download and install the backdoor might not be the most stealthy method, and sophisticated groups might use more covert techniques. However, the question is about FamousSparrow specifically, and if that's their modus operandi, then it's plausible.

Also, the fact that they're acquiring infrastructure from specific companies suggests that this is a deliberate step in their operation, likely after they've gained initial access and established a foothold through the backdoor.

Given all this, I think the most plausible sequence is as described, so I'll go with A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
