To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events and analyze whether obfuscation techniques are likely to be used after the final stage of the attack as described.

First, let's understand the attack sequence:

1. **Suspicious Email with Word Document:** The attack starts with an email containing a Word document that has a macro dropper.

2. **Macro Dropper Executes JavaScript Payload:** When the user opens the Word document and enables macros, the macro dropper executes a JavaScript payload.

3. **JavaScript Downloader Drops a File:** This JavaScript payload then downloads a file from a specified URL.

4. **File is Executed in Temporary Directory:** The downloaded file is executed in the system's temporary directory.

Now, the question is asking whether, after this sequence, it is likely that the attacker used obfuscation techniques to hinder the analysis process.

Obfuscation is a technique used by attackers to make their code or activities difficult to understand or analyze. It is commonly used at various stages of an attack to evade detection and analysis.

Let's consider the timing of obfuscation in this context:

- **Before Execution:** Obfuscation is often applied to the initial payload (like the macro or the JavaScript) to make it harder for security solutions to detect the malicious code.

- **During Execution:** Some obfuscation techniques can be applied during the execution phase to hide the activities or the communication with command and control servers.

- **After Execution:** It's less common for obfuscation to be applied after the final payload has been executed, especially if the goal is to maintain persistence or perform further actions on the system.

In the given sequence:

- The macro dropper likely uses some level of obfuscation to avoid detection by antivirus or email filters.

- The JavaScript payload may also be obfuscated to make static analysis difficult.

- The downloaded file could be encrypted or packed to hide its true nature.

However, once the final payload is executed in the temporary directory, the need for obfuscation decreases if the payload is already running on the system and performing its intended actions.

Therefore, it is less likely that the attacker would apply obfuscation techniques after the final payload has been executed, as the main objectives (execution and potential system compromise) have already been achieved.

Moreover, applying obfuscation after the final payload execution might even draw attention from security analysts, as it would be an unusual step and could indicate that the attacker is trying to hide something.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
