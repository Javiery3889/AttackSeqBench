To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of events and understand the typical behavior of a backdoor program communicating with its command and control (C2) server, especially when using DNS tunneling.

First, it's important to understand what DNS tunneling is. DNS tunneling is a method of using the DNS protocol to exfiltrate data from a compromised system or to receive commands from a C2 server. It's a stealthy way for malware to communicate because DNS traffic is usually allowed through firewalls.

Now, let's look at the sequence of events described in the question:

1. The backdoor program establishes communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling.

2. It parses the returned data, extracting commands from the C2 server.

3. It gathers host information during the discovery phase.

The question is asking whether, after establishing communication and before gathering host information, the backdoor is likely to parse the returned data and extract commands from the C2 server.

To answer this, we need to consider the typical sequence of operations for a backdoor program.

Generally, when a backdoor establishes communication with its C2 server, it's to receive instructions or commands on what to do next. So, the sequence would be:

- Establish communication with C2.

- Receive data from C2.

- Parse the received data to extract commands.

- Execute those commands.

One of the commands might be to gather host information, which is part of the discovery phase. So, in this context, parsing the returned data to extract commands comes before gathering host information.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that the backdoor program would parse the returned data and extract commands from the C2 server before gathering host information during the discovery phase.

However, let's consider if there might be scenarios where this isn't the case.

Perhaps in some backdoors, the initial communication might involve sending some basic information about the host before waiting for commands. But even in such cases, after sending initial data, the backdoor would still expect to receive commands from the C2 server, which would require parsing the returned data.

Moreover, in the context of DNS tunneling, the backdoor might need to handle the data in a specific way due to the constraints of the DNS protocol, but the fundamental sequence of receiving data, parsing it, and then acting on the commands should still hold.

Therefore, based on standard backdoor behavior and the typical sequence of operations in malware communication with C2 servers, the most plausible sequence is that the backdoor parses the returned data to extract commands before gathering host information.

So, the answer is "Yes."
