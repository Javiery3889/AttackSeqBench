To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand what's being asked. The question is about a specific malware variant called Mustang Panda's Korplug. It mentions that this variant uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, involving compressed and encrypted messages. Then, it asks whether, after performing this data exfiltration, it is likely to perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

So, essentially, we need to determine if this malware, after exfiltrating data using a custom TCP protocol, would also engage in data discovery activities like scanning and collecting information from all mapped drives.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To make an informed decision, we need to consider a few things:

1. **Understanding the Malware's Objective**: Generally, malware has specific objectives, such as stealing data, disrupting systems, or maintaining persistence. Data exfiltration is a common goal, especially in the case of espionage or theft.

2. **Sequence of Actions**: The question suggests that the malware first uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration. After that, it's asking whether it's likely to perform data discovery.

3. **Data Discovery Activities**: Collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives sounds like an extensive data gathering process. This could be part of the initial reconnaissance or part of ongoing data theft.

Now, let's think about the likelihood of these activities occurring in sequence.

**Step 1: Data Exfiltration**

The malware uses a custom protocol over TCP to exfiltrate data. This suggests that it has already identified some data to steal and has a method to transmit it securely and stealthily.

**Step 2: Data Discovery**

After exfiltrating data, why would the malware need to perform data discovery? Typically, data discovery is an early step in a malware's lifecycle, where it identifies what data to steal. If it has already exfiltrated data, performing data discovery might be redundant unless it's looking for more data to steal in a continuous process.

However, it's possible that the malware is designed to continuously scan and exfiltrate data. In that case, after initial exfiltration, it might proceed to perform more data discovery to find additional information to steal.

On the other hand, if the malware's primary goal is to exfiltrate specific data and it has already done so, it might not need to perform further data discovery.

**Considering the Malware's Behavior**

Mustang Panda, also known as APT27 or Emissary Panda, is a Chinese state-sponsored threat group known for its espionage activities. Korplug is a backdoor used by this group.

Given that it's a state-sponsored actor, their malware is likely to be sophisticated and designed for long-term access and data theft. Therefore, it's plausible that after initial data exfiltration, the malware continues to look for more data to steal.

**Custom Protocol Implications**

The use of a custom protocol for data exfiltration suggests that the malware is designed to avoid detection by security systems. Compressing and encrypting messages further enhances its stealthiness. If it's set up for continuous data exfiltration, it makes sense that it would also perform continuous data discovery to feed that exfiltration process.

**Mapped Drives Consideration**

Collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives indicates that the malware is interested in data stored not only locally but also on network shares or other connected storage devices. This broad scope suggests a thorough data gathering approach, which aligns with the objectives of espionage groups.

**Conclusion**

Given the nature of Mustang Panda as a state-sponsored threat group and the sophistication of the Korplug variant, it is likely that after exfiltrating data, the malware would continue to perform data discovery to find more information to steal. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
