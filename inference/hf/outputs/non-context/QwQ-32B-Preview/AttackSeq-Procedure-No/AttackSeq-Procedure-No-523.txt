To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the scenario presented in the question is plausible based on common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the attack sequence as described:

1. **Initial Access:** A malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file is used to gain initial access.

2. **Execution of 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script:** This script is presumably dropped or executed as part of the initial access.

3. **Download of a zip file containing malware components:** The 'fmx.ps1' script is said to download a zip file with components for the malware payload.

4. **Decoding and executing a base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg':** After downloading the zip file, the script is supposed to decode and execute a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.

Now, let's evaluate the plausibility of this sequence.

**Step 1: Initial Access via Malicious Document**

It's common for attackers to use malicious Office documents, especially Word documents, as initial access vectors. These documents often contain macros or exploit vulnerabilities in Office applications to execute malicious code. So, this part aligns with known attack tactics.

**Step 2: Execution of 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell Script**

Once the malicious document is opened, it may execute a PowerShell script, in this case, 'fmx.ps1'. PowerShell is a favored tool among attackers because of its flexibility and powerful capabilities within Windows environments.

**Step 3: Downloading a Zip File Containing Malware Components**

It's plausible that the PowerShell script downloads additional payloads or components. Attackers often stage their attacks, dropping initial scripts to download more sophisticated malware to avoid detection and to make analysis more difficult.

**Step 4: Decoding and Executing a Base64 Encoded Script in 'sdmc.jpg'**

This part is a bit unusual. Typically, attackers may store encoded scripts in various files, including image files, to obfuscate their payloads. However, the sequence described suggests that after downloading a zip file containing malware components, the script then decodes and executes a base64 encoded script from 'sdmc.jpg'. This seems a bit convoluted.

Let's consider an alternative sequence that might be more plausible:

- The initial PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1') downloads a zip file containing multiple components, including 'sdmc.jpg'.

- The script then extracts 'sdmc.jpg' from the zip file.

- It decodes the base64 content embedded within 'sdmc.jpg' to reveal another script or payload.

- Finally, it executes this decoded script.

This alternative sequence makes more sense because it consolidates the download and execution steps. However, the question specifies that the 'fmx.ps1' script will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload only before decoding and executing the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.

Given this, I need to determine if this sequence is likely.

**Evaluation Based on MITRE ATT&CK Framework**

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, several tactics and techniques align with this sequence:

- **Initial Access (TA0001):** Using malicious files (T1566.001) such as malicious Office documents.

- **Execution (TA0002):** Executing a script (T1086) like PowerShell.

- **Persistence (TA0003):** Potentially establishing persistence through registry modifications or other means, but not directly mentioned here.

- **Defense Evasion (TA0005):** Using obfuscated scripts (T1027.002) and hiding code within images (T1003.004).

- **Command and Control (TA0011):** Downloading additional payloads (T1101).

- **Execution (TA0002):** Decoding and executing the downloaded script.

So, the sequence described does align with several techniques used in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Plausibility Assessment**

While the sequence is plausible, the specific order of operations seems a bit intricate. Attackers often aim for efficiency and minimize the number of steps to reduce the risk of detection. However, sophisticated attackers may employ such multi-step processes to evade defenses and analysis.

Considering that the sequence involves:

1. Delivering a malicious document.

2. Executing a PowerShell script.

3. Downloading a zip file.

4. Extracting and decoding a script from an image file.

5. Executing the decoded script.

This sequence is possible but might be more complex than necessary for many attack scenarios. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for malware to use multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation to protect its payload.

**Conclusion**

Given the analysis above, it is likely that the sequence described could be part of a cyber attack, especially one carried out by a sophisticated actor. Therefore, the answer to the question is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
