I have this question here about a sequence of events in a cyber attack, and I need to decide if it's likely that after people get tricked into opening a fake document, they'll then receive more phishing emails with links to RTF documents that exploit a specific vulnerability to deliver a malware called QuasarRAT, but only after they've already been infected with QuasarRAT. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events described in the question:

1. Recipients are presented with a document that looks like a legitimate blog post or report.

2. After that, they receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.

3. The key point is whether these phishing emails come only after the recipients have already been infected with QuasarRAT.

So, the question is asking if it's likely that the phishing emails with the RTF documents are sent only to those who have already been infected.

To answer this, I need to think about how cyber attacks typically work, especially those involving spear phishing and malware delivery.

First, spear phishing is a targeted attack where the attacker crafts emails that appear to come from a trusted source, with the goal of getting the recipient to click on a link or open an attachment that contains malware.

In this case, the initial document is a fake blog post or report, which might be part of the phishing email or something else. Then, later, they receive more phishing emails with links to RTF documents that exploit a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-8750) to deliver QuasarRAT.

Now, the question is whether these subsequent phishing emails are sent only to those who have already been infected with QuasarRAT.

To answer this, I need to consider the attacker's strategy. Generally, attackers want to maximize the number of infections with their malware. Sending phishing emails to those who have already been infected might not make much sense because those systems are already under the attacker's control.

However, there could be reasons why an attacker might send additional phishing emails to already infected systems:

1. **Redundancy:** Ensure that the infection is maintained in case the initial malware is removed.

2. **Upgrading Malware:** Deliver a newer version of the malware or additional malware.

3. **Data Verification:** Confirm that the system is still compromised.

4. **Lateral Movement:** Use the already infected system as a pivot point to infect other systems within the same network.

But, these actions might not necessarily require sending more phishing emails. Attackers can often update malware or move laterally without user interaction.

Moreover, sending phishing emails to already infected systems could raise red flags, as it might be detected by security systems or alert the users.

Therefore, it's less likely that attackers would send additional phishing emails specifically to those who have already been infected.

Instead, it's more common for attackers to use phishing campaigns to initially infect systems and then use the compromised systems for further activities without needing to phish the same targets again.

Additionally, targeting only those who have already been infected would require the attacker to have a way of identifying which systems have been successfully infected, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the attack.

Given this reasoning, I would say that it's not likely that the phishing emails with the RTF documents are sent only to those who have already been infected with QuasarRAT.

Therefore, the answer should be "No."

**Final Answer: B**
