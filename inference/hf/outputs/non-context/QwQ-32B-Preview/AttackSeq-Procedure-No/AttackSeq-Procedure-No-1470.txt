So I've got this question here about whether it's likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution, especially after some reconnaissance activities. There are two answer choices: A) Yes and B) No. I need to decide which one makes more sense based on what I know about cybersecurity and attack patterns.

First, let's break down the question and understand the components mentioned:

1. **Reconnaissance Activities**: This is the initial stage where attackers gather information about their target. They might look for publicly available data on the systems, employees, and network structure. Active discovery methods could involve scanning the network for open ports, identifying services, and looking for vulnerabilities.

2. **Malicious Implants like BlackEnergy 3**: BlackEnergy is a type of malware that has been used in various cyberattacks, particularly against industrial control systems. It's known for its modular design, allowing attackers to add different capabilities based on their needs.

3. **Ruby Scripts**: Ruby is a programming language that can be used to write scripts for various purposes, including automation and, unfortunately, malicious activities.

4. **Payload Execution through Employee-Enabled Macro Execution**: This refers to social engineering tactics where attackers trick employees into enabling macros in documents, which then execute malicious code, leading to the installation of malware on the network.

Now, considering these points, the question is asking if it's likely that, after performing reconnaissance, attackers using something like BlackEnergy 3 would use Ruby scripts to execute payloads that were installed via employee-enabled macro execution.

Let's think about this step by step.

**Step 1: Understanding the Attack Vector**

The attack starts with reconnaissance, which is standard procedure for most cyberattacks. Attackers need to know their target's environment, including systems, networks, and potential entry points.

**Step 2: Initial Compromise**

The initial compromise mentioned here is through employee-enabled macro execution. This is a common tactic where attackers send phishing emails with malicious attachments, often Microsoft Office documents that contain macros. When the employee enables these macros, the malicious code runs, often downloading and executing malware on the system.

**Step 3: Malware Deployment**

The malware in question is similar to BlackEnergy 3. BlackEnergy is known for its modular design, which allows attackers to include various plugins or modules to perform different functions, such as data exfiltration, system reconnaissance, or even destructive actions like wipers.

**Step 4: Use of Ruby Scripts for Payload Execution**

The question specifically asks whether it's likely that such malware would use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network.

Now, considering that BlackEnergy is a malware family, it's typically written in a programming language suitable for creating executable files, often C or C++. It's designed to run natively on the target system without depending on additional interpreters unless specifically included.

Ruby, being an interpreted language, would require the target system to have a Ruby interpreter installed to run Ruby scripts. While Ruby is not uncommon, it's not as universally present on systems as, say, Python or even PowerShell in Windows environments.

**Step 5: Likelihood Assessment**

Given that the malware is already installed on the system through macro execution, it would likely come with its own set of capabilities or download additional modules as needed. Using a Ruby script for executing payloads would add an extra dependencyâ€”ensuring that Ruby is installed on the target system.

Attackers generally aim for stealth and efficiency. Introducing an additional dependency like Ruby might increase the risk of detection or failure if Ruby isn't installed. Therefore, it's less likely that such malware would rely on Ruby scripts for executing payloads.

Moreover, malware authors tend to use execution methods that are more universally available and less likely to raise alarms. For example, in Windows environments, they might prefer using PowerShell, which is natively available and can execute scripts without leaving obvious file artifacts.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

Based on this reasoning, it seems less likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 would use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed via employee-enabled macro execution. Therefore, the answer is probably "No."

**Final Answer: B**
