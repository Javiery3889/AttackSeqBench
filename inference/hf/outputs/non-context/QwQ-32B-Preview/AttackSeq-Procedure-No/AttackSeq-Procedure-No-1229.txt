To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the establishment of command and control (C2) communication through backdoor malware is a plausible step in the attack sequence.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Actor**: Lazarus group

2. **Action**: Deployed Hermes ransomware

3. **Method**: Encrypted files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm

4. **Evidence**: Left ransom notes in encrypted directories

5. **Question**: Is it likely that they established C2 communication by utilizing backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands?

Given that the Lazarus group is known for its sophisticated and multi-stage attack campaigns, it's essential to consider the typical behavior of such advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Initial Compromise and Ransomware Deployment**:

   - The Lazarus group is known for deploying various malware, including ransomware, as part of their operations. Hermes ransomware is one such tool they have used.

   - Encrypting files with a 2048-bit RSA algorithm aligns with ransomware tactics, as the goal is to render data inaccessible until a ransom is paid.

   - Leaving ransom notes in encrypted directories is a standard procedure for ransomware operators to communicate their demands to the victims.

2. **Backdoor Malware for C2 Communication**:

   - APT groups often use backdoor malware to maintain persistent access to compromised systems and to establish C2 communication channels.

   - Backdoors allow attackers to execute commands, exfiltrate data, and perform other malicious activities without being detected.

   - The mention of "Samples #4 and #6" likely refers to specific malware samples identified by the researchers or analysts.

3. **Plausibility of C2 Communication After Ransomware Deployment**:

   - In many ransomware attacks, especially those carried out by APT groups, there is a phase before the actual encryption where the attackers map the network, exfiltrate sensitive data, and prepare for the ransomware deployment.

   - Establishing C2 communication through backdoor malware is crucial for these preparatory steps.

   - However, once the ransomware is deployed and files are encrypted, the primary objective might be achieved, and the need for continued C2 communication could diminish, especially if the attackers have already exfiltrated valuable data.

4. **Lazarus Group's Modus Operandi**:

   - The Lazarus group is known for conducting complex, multi-stage attacks that often involve a variety of malware and TTPs.

   - They have been associated with both espionage and financially motivated activities, including ransomware attacks.

   - Given their sophistication, it is plausible that they would use backdoor malware for C2 communication as part of their attack sequence.

5. **Sequence of TTPs**:

   - Initial compromise via phishing, exploit kits, or other vectors.

   - Deployment of backdoor malware to establish C2 communication.

   - Lateral movement within the network to gain access to more systems.

   - Exfiltration of sensitive data.

   - Deployment of ransomware to encrypt files and demand ransom.

   - Potential use of backdoors to monitor the environment or conduct further attacks.

Given this sequence, it is likely that backdoor malware was used earlier in the attack chain to establish C2 communication, which facilitated the deployment of the ransomware.

**Conclusion**:

Considering the typical behavior of the Lazarus group and the standard sequence of TTPs in APT attacks, it is plausible that they utilized backdoor malware to establish C2 communication as part of their attack sequence leading up to the deployment of Hermes ransomware.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
