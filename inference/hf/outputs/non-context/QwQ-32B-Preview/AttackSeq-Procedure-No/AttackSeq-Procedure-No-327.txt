To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of events in a typical cyber attack, particularly one involving malware on an iOS device. The question mentions that after certain actions during the Command and Control (C2) phase, there's a possibility of further activities like collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase. I need to determine if this sequence makes sense based on my knowledge of malware behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the phases mentioned:

1. **Command and Control (C2) Phase**: This is where the malware communicates with its operator or a server controlled by the attacker. Actions like sending gathered information, writing log messages, using tokens for communication, and uploading files are typical activities in this phase. The malware is essentially reporting back to its controller and possibly receiving new instructions.

2. **Discovery Phase**: In this phase, the malware likely seeks to understand the environment it's in, including the system it's running on and the network it's connected to. This can involve gathering information about user data, system configurations, and other details that could be useful for further attacks or exfiltration.

Given this context, the question is whether, after performing C2 activities, the malware would proceed to collect specific types of information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

Let's consider the following points:

- **Sequence of Phases**: Typically, in a malware lifecycle, the Discovery phase comes before the C2 phase. During Discovery, the malware gathers information about the target environment, which it then uses during the C2 phase to report back to the attacker and receive further instructions. However, the question suggests that C2 activities are happening first, followed by Discovery, which seems counterintuitive based on standard malware behavior.

- **Purpose of Each Phase**: The primary purpose of C2 is communication and control, whereas Discovery is about understanding the environment. Collecting sensitive user data like text messages, contacts, and location seems more aligned with the Exfiltration or Impact phases, where the malware aims to steal data or cause harm.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversarial behaviors, the actions described—such as sending information, writing logs, using tokens for communication, and uploading files—fall under different tactics and techniques. For example, sending information and uploading files relate to Exfiltration, while writing logs might be part of Defense Evasion or Command and Control.

Given these points, it seems unusual that the Discovery phase would follow the C2 phase in the sequence described. Moreover, collecting sensitive user data like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data is more characteristic of Exfiltration or Impact phases rather than Discovery.

Therefore, the answer is likely "No," it is not plausible that the app will collect such information during the Discovery phase after performing C2 activities as described.

**Final Answer: B**
