So I've got this question here about malware and cyber attacks, and I need to choose between "Yes" and "No." Let me try to understand what's being asked.

First, it mentions a "zero-day exploit" in a Word document that infects a target with something called "Plexor malware." Then it talks about "Longhorn's tools" performing system fingerprinting and discovery before following guidelines to avoid detection. The question is whether this sequence of events is likely.

Okay, let's break this down. A zero-day exploit is a vulnerability that is exploited before the developer knows about it, so there's no patch for it yet. That sounds pretty serious. The fact that it's in a Word document suggests that it's probably a Microsoft Office exploit, which isn't uncommon since Office has had its share of vulnerabilities over the years.

Plexor malwareâ€”I'm not familiar with that specific name, but malware comes in many forms, so maybe it's a specific type of malware used for espionage. The question mentions that it's espionage-focused, which gives me a clue about its purpose.

Then there's "Longhorn's tools." I think Longhorn might be a reference to a group or a set of tools used by attackers. I've heard of Cozy Bear, Fancy Bear, and other groups, but I'm not sure about Longhorn. Maybe it's a less-known group or perhaps a typo. Or maybe it's a placeholder name in this context. I'll assume it's a group associated with the malware.

The question is whether, after infecting a system with this malware, it's likely that these tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery before taking further actions to avoid detection.

Well, in general, when malware infects a system, one of the first things it often does is gather information about the environment it's in. This is called reconnaissance or discovery. It helps the malware understand the system's configuration, what data is available, and how to move laterally within a network if necessary. Fingerprinting is a part of this process, where the malware identifies the operating system, installed software, open ports, and other details that can be exploited.

Given that this malware is described as espionage-focused, it makes sense that it would want to gather as much information as possible about the target system and network to carry out its objectives effectively. Espionage malware is designed to steal sensitive information, so knowing what's on the system and how to access it without being detected is crucial.

Moreover, avoiding detection is a key aspect of any malware, especially those used for espionage. Attackers don't want their malware to be discovered and removed, as that would halt their data exfiltration efforts. Therefore, it's standard practice for such malware to have mechanisms in place to remain stealthy and to follow certain guidelines or routines to minimize their footprint.

So, putting it all together, it seems likely that after infecting a system with this zero-day exploit via a Word document, the malware would perform system fingerprinting and discovery to understand the environment and then proceed with its activities while following guidelines to avoid detection.

Therefore, I think the answer is "Yes."

But let me consider the "No" option as well. Maybe there are scenarios where the malware doesn't need to perform fingerprinting because it's already tailored to the specific environment it's targeting. Or perhaps the malware is designed to act immediately without needing to gather information first. However, even in such cases, some level of discovery can be beneficial to ensure the malware operates effectively.

Additionally, the question mentions that the malware is espionage-focused, which typically requires a thorough understanding of the target system to maximize data theft. So, overall, it seems more plausible that the malware would perform these activities.

Hence, my final answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
