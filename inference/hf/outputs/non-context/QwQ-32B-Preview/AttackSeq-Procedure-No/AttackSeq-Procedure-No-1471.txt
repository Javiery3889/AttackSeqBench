To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved in a cyber attack, particularly focusing on the use of malicious VBA scripts and the BlackEnergy 3 Remote Access Trojan (RAT). I'll also consider the role of phishing in such attacks and how these elements relate to each other in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Establishing C2 through malicious VBA script execution:** This suggests that adversaries have already gained initial access to a system by executing a malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script. VBA scripts are commonly used in Microsoft Office documents and can be a vector for delivering malware.

2. **Performing a phishing campaign to deliver BlackEnergy 3 RAT:** The question is asking whether, after establishing C2, adversaries are likely to conduct a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems.

Now, let's consider the sequence of events:

- **Initial Access:** The adversaries have already used a malicious VBA script to gain initial access and establish a C2 connection. This means they have a foothold in the target environment.

- **Next Steps:** The question is about whether they would then perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.

Let's think about this logically:

- **Phishing Campaign for RAT Delivery:** Phishing is a common initial access vector, where attackers send malicious emails to trick users into executing malware. However, in this scenario, the adversaries have already established C2 through a different method (malicious VBA script execution).

- **Need for Additional Phishing:** If adversaries already have a C2 channel, why would they need to conduct another phishing campaign to deliver the RAT? They might already have the ability to laterally move within the network and deploy additional malware without needing to rely on social engineering tactics like phishing.

- **BlackEnergy 3 RAT:** BlackEnergy is a well-known malware family associated with various cyber operations, including those attributed to the Sandworm threat group. It's capable of performing various malicious activities, including data exfiltration and system compromise.

Considering the above points, it seems unlikely that adversaries who have already established C2 through a malicious VBA script would need to perform another phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT. They might choose to deploy the RAT directly through their existing C2 channel or through lateral movement techniques.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
