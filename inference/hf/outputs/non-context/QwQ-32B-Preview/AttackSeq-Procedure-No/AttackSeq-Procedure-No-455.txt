To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the statement in the question is likely to be true based on typical APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack patterns, especially those involving the use of PowerShell and Shellcode for initial access and command and control (C2) communication.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.

2. **Core Step of the Attack:** The question is whether Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No," so I need to determine which one is more plausible based on my knowledge of APT tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), particularly within the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Understanding the Components:**

- **PowerShell:** Often used by attackers for execution because it's a built-in scripting language in Windows, providing extensive capabilities to interact with the operating system and applications.

- **Shellcode:** This is a piece of code that is injected into a process to perform specific actions, often to establish a foothold or to download and execute additional payloads.

- **Multi-beacon Communication:** This likely refers to using multiple C2 channels or beacons to communicate with the compromised system, which can be a tactic for defense evasion to avoid detection by security solutions.

**Sequence of Events:**

1. **Initial Access:** APT-TOCS uses PowerShell to execute Shellcode.

2. **Execution in Memory:** The Shellcode is executed in memory.

3. **Multi-beacon Communication:** Employed for defense evasion.

The question is whether the Shellcode functionalities were executed in memory only after multi-beacon communication was established.

**Analysis:**

In typical APT attack sequences, the initial access vector is used to gain a foothold on the target system. This often involves executing some form of payload, such as Shellcode, which can then reach out to a C2 server to receive further instructions or download additional tools.

Defense evasion techniques, such as using multi-beacon communication, are usually employed throughout the attack lifecycle to avoid detection. This could include varying communication patterns, using encryption, or communicating over multiple channels.

Given this, it's plausible that after initial access, the attackers would establish C2 communication (possibly with multi-beacon techniques for evasion) and then execute further functionalities based on commands received from the C2 server.

However, the question specifies whether the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after employing multi-beacon communication.

Considering that the Shellcode needs to be executed to establish C2 communication in the first place, it's likely that some initial Shellcode is executed to set up the communication channel. Then, additional functionalities could be downloaded or executed based on that established communication.

Therefore, it's more accurate to say that the initial Shellcode is executed to establish C2 communication (possibly using multi-beacon techniques), and then further functionalities are executed based on that communication.

So, in the core step of the attack, after initial access, the Shellcode is executed to set up multi-beacon communication, and then further actions are taken.

Thus, the statement in the question seems plausible: Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory during the core step of the attack only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
