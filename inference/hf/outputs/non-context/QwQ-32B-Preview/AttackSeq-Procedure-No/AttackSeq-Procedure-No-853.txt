To answer this question, I need to analyze the relationship between fileless techniques for defense evasion and process hollowing in the context of the Dexphot malware's behavior.

First, let's understand what fileless techniques and process hollowing are:

1. **Fileless Techniques**: These are methods used by malware to operate without writing files to the disk, making them harder to detect by traditional antivirus software that relies on file signatures.

2. **Process Hollowing**: This is a technique where an attacker creates a new process in a suspended state and then replaces its memory content with malicious code before resuming its execution. This makes the malicious activity appear as part of a legitimate process.

Now, the question states that Dexphot uses fileless techniques for defense evasion and asks whether it is likely to use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage.

Let's consider the following points:

- **Defense Evasion through Fileless Techniques**: If Dexphot is already using fileless techniques, it means that it is operating in memory without leaving artifacts on the disk that could be easily detected.

- **Process Hollowing as a Method of Execution**: Process hollowing is a method that can be used to execute code within the address space of a legitimate process, which can help in evading detection as the malicious activity is disguised within a trusted process.

Given that Dexphot is already employing fileless techniques for defense evasion, it is plausible that it would use process hollowing as part of its execution strategy. Process hollowing aligns with fileless techniques because it involves executing code in memory without writing to the disk, thereby maintaining a low profile and avoiding detection.

Moreover, process hollowing is a known technique used by malware to inject code into legitimate processes, which can help in bypassing security measures that monitor for unusual process creations or modifications.

Therefore, considering the context provided and the nature of both fileless techniques and process hollowing, it is likely that Dexphot would use process hollowing during the execution stage.

**Final Answer: A**
