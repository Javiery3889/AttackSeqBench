To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and evaluate whether it's plausible for BlackSoul to encrypt C2 traffic using a copy of the OpenSSL library before communicating with the C2 server over the RESTful Strapi protocol with JSON-based data encoding.

First, let's break down the components mentioned:

1. **Gathering browser data**: This is a common tactic used by malware to steal sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

2. **Encrypting C2 traffic using OpenSSL**: OpenSSL is a widely used library for implementing secure communications and encrypted data transfers. Using it to encrypt C2 traffic would help conceal the data being sent to the C2 server, making it harder for security solutions to detect malicious activities.

3. **Communicating with the C2 server over RESTful Strapi protocol with JSON-based data encoding**: Strapi is an open-source headless CMS and a powerful Node.js Content Management Framework. It can be used to set up a RESTful API, and using JSON for data encoding is standard in many web applications and APIs due to its simplicity and efficiency.

Now, considering these components, is it likely that BlackSoul would follow this sequence of actions?

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- **Tactic Plausibility**: Malware stealing browser data and communicating with a C2 server is entirely plausible. It's a common modus operandi for many types of malware, including information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs).

- **Use of OpenSSL for Encryption**: Using a library like OpenSSL to encrypt C2 traffic is also plausible. Malware authors often employ encryption to obfuscate their communications and evade detection by network security solutions. Including a copy of OpenSSL in the malware would provide a robust way to handle encryption without relying on system-installed libraries, which could be monitored or altered.

- **Choosing Strapi with JSON Encoding**: Selecting Strapi as the C2 protocol and using JSON for data encoding is also reasonable. Strapi is a modern, flexible framework that can easily handle RESTful APIs, and JSON is a standard format for data interchange. This combination would allow for efficient and flexible communication between the malware and the C2 server.

Given these points, the sequence of actions described seems plausible for a piece of malware like BlackSoul. Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely.

**Final Answer: A**
