To answer this question, we need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the sequence makes sense in the context of the attack lifecycle, particularly focusing on the activities of Moafee and DragonOK, which are known threat groups.

First, let's break down the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails are used as the primary attack vector.

2. **Execution:** Custom-built backdoors and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are utilized during resource development.

3. **Persistence and Evasion:** Environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, are employed to execute payloads.

The question is whether it's likely that these threat groups would use the evasion techniques after executing the backdoors and RATs.

To evaluate this, we need to understand the typical sequence of events in a cyber attack, especially one involving targeted threats like those from Moafee and DragonOK.

### Analysis

**Step 1: Initial Access**

Spear-phishing emails are a common initial access vector for sophisticated threat actors. They craft convincing emails with attachments or links that, when interacted with, deliver the payload to the target system.

**Step 2: Execution**

Once the target interacts with the phishing email, the payload is executed. This could be a backdoor or a RAT that allows the threat actor to gain initial control over the system.

**Step 3: Persistence and Evasion**

To maintain access and avoid detection, threat actors often employ various evasion techniques. Environment-based evasion techniques, such as checking the number of CPU cores, are used to ensure that the payload only executes in a genuine environment and not in a virtual machine or sandboxes that security researchers might use to analyze the malware.

### Sequence Evaluation

The question suggests that the evasion techniques are used "only after" using backdoors and RATs. However, in reality, evasion techniques are typically employed before executing the main payload to ensure that the environment is safe and conducive for the malware's operation.

Here's why:

- **Pre-Execution Evasion:** Malware often performs checks before executing its payload to avoid analysis and detection. For example, checking the system's configuration, presence of security software, or environmental characteristics like the number of CPU cores.

- **Post-Execution Activities:** After ensuring the environment is safe, the malware proceeds to execute its payload, which may include installing backdoors or RATs for persistent access.

Therefore, the sequence described in the question seems inverted. Evasion techniques are usually applied prior to executing the backdoors and RATs, not after.

### Conclusion

Given the typical attack lifecycle and the usual sequence of TTPs employed by threat actors, it is unlikely that Moafee and DragonOK would utilize environment-based evasion techniques after executing their backdoors and RATs during resource development.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
