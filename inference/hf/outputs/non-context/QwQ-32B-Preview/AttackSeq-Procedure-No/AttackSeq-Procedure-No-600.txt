To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the Sednit group and determine if the described sequence is plausible based on known behavior.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** The Sednit group launches campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros.

2. **Post-Initial Access:** After gaining initial access, the malware is likely to target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase.

I need to evaluate if this sequence of events is likely based on what is known about the Sednit group's modus operandi.

**Step 1: Understanding the Sednit Group**

The Sednit group, also known as APT28, Sofacy, Fancy Bear, and Strontium, is a Russian-based advanced persistent threat group. They are known for their sophisticated cyber espionage campaigns targeting government, military, diplomatic, and political organizations worldwide.

**Step 2: Initial Access Vector**

The group is known to use various initial access vectors, including phishing emails with malicious attachments. These attachments often contain macro-enabled documents that, when enabled, execute malicious code, leading to the deployment of their malware.

So, the initial access described in the question—using malicious documents with VBA macros—is consistent with Sednit's known tactics.

**Step 3: Post-Initial Access Activities**

After gaining initial access, APT groups typically perform several activities to establish a foothold, maintain persistence, and move laterally within the target network. One of the key phases in the MITRE ATT&CK framework is the "Discovery" phase, where adversaries seek to understand the target environment better.

**Step 4: Targeting IP Ranges for Vulnerability Scanning**

During the Discovery phase, it is common for adversaries to scan the target network for vulnerable systems or services. This can involve scanning IP ranges to identify potential entry points or assets of interest.

Given that the target is government and critical infrastructure organizations, these entities often have extensive networks with various systems that could be of interest to an adversary like Sednit.

**Step 5: Plausibility Assessment**

Is it plausible that Sednit would target IP ranges related to government and critical infrastructure organizations for vulnerability scanning after gaining initial access?

Given that Sednit is known for targeting these types of organizations, and that vulnerability scanning is a standard activity in the Discovery phase, this sequence of TTPs aligns well with their known modus operandi.

**Step 6: Considering Alternatives**

Option B suggests "No," implying that this sequence is not likely. However, based on the analysis above, there is no indication that this sequence deviates from Sednit's known behaviors.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase after launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.

**Final Answer: A**
