To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that FamousSparrow, a hypothetical threat actor, might employ after using a custom version of Mimikatz for credential access. The question specifically asks whether, during the Discovery phase, FamousSparrow is likely to retrieve metadata for files on disk and list the current working directory before reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the command and control (C&C) server.

First, let's break down the components of the question:

1. **Credential Access using Mimikatz:** Mimikatz is a well-known tool for extracting plaintext credentials from memory. A custom version suggests that the threat actor has modified it to suit their needs or evade detection.

2. **Discovery Phase:** In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the Discovery phase involves actions taken by the attacker to understand the target environment better. This includes identifying systems, users, permissions, and available data.

3. **Retrieve metadata for files on disk and list the current working directory:** These activities fall under the Discovery phase as they help the attacker understand what files are present, their properties, and the current operational context.

4. **Read file contents and exfiltrate to C&C server:** These actions are part of the Collection and Exfiltration phases, where the attacker gathers sensitive information and sends it back to their control server.

Now, evaluating the sequence:

- **After Credential Access:** Once credentials are obtained, the attacker can use them to move laterally within the network, access restricted resources, or perform actions with higher privileges.

- **Discovery Activities:** It is common for attackers to perform Discovery activities after gaining initial access or obtaining credentials. This helps them map the environment, identify high-value targets, and plan further steps.

- **Sequence of Actions:** The question proposes that after credential access, the attacker would perform Discovery activities (retrieve file metadata and list the current working directory) before collecting and exfiltrating files.

Let's consider whether this sequence makes sense:

- **Plausibility of Sequence:**

  - **Retrieve metadata for files on disk:** This activity aligns with Discovery as it helps the attacker identify which files are of interest based on metadata such as file names, sizes, modification dates, etc.

  - **List the current working directory:** This provides context about the attacker's current location within the file system, aiding in navigation and understanding the directory structure.

  - **Read file contents and exfiltrate:** These actions follow logically after identifying the files of interest during the Discovery phase.

Therefore, the sequence described seems plausible.

Given this analysis, the answer to the question is that yes, it is likely for FamousSparrow to perform these Discovery activities before collecting and exfiltrating files.
