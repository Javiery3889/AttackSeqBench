To answer this question, I need to think about the typical steps an attacker might take when targeting a specific application like Kavach, which is a multi-factor authentication (MFA) app used by the Government of India. The question is asking whether, before targeting Kavach specifically, the attacker is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems.

First, I need to understand what each of these components is:

- **LNK files**: These are shortcut files in Windows that can contain commands to execute when opened. Malicious LNK files can be used to execute arbitrary code.

- **HTAs (HTML Application files)**: These are files that can contain scripts and are executed by Microsoft's HTML Application host, which can run with higher privileges than a web browser.

- **Loader DLLs**: These are dynamic link libraries that can be used to load other DLLs or executables, often used in malware to inject code into processes.

The question is about the sequence of actions an attacker might take. Specifically, it's asking whether these infection vectors (malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs) are used only after the attacker has already gained initial access to the victim's system.

To answer this, I need to consider the typical phases of an attack, such as those outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The framework describes various stages of an attack, including initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, and impact.

Given this, initial access is the first stage where the attacker tries to gain a foothold on the target system. After initial access, the attacker may use various techniques to execute payloads, establish persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network.

Now, considering the tools mentioned:

- **Malicious LNK files**: These could be used as part of the initial access vector, for example, by tricking a user into opening a malicious shortcut file attached to an email or downloaded from a compromised website.

- **HTAs**: Similarly, HTAs could be used as part of the initial access, for example, by convincing a user to open an HTML application that contains malicious scripts.

- **Loader DLLs**: These might be used after initial access to load other malicious components or to inject code into processes for persistence or privilege escalation.

Given this, it seems that some of these tools could be used for initial access, while others might be used for subsequent stages.

However, the question specifies "before targeting Kavach, is SideCopy likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems?"

SideCopy is a tool associated with the UNC2630 threat group, which has been linked to attacks involving the side-loading of DLLs to bypass security measures. Kavach is the target in this scenario.

Given that, it's important to consider whether the infection chain involving these tools would be used only after initial access has been established.

Considering that malicious LNK files and HTAs could be used for initial access, it seems that using them only after initial access has been established might not make sense from an attacker's perspective. Instead, these tools are likely used as part of the initial access vector to gain a foothold on the system.

On the other hand, loader DLLs might be used after initial access to maintain persistence or to load additional payloads.

Therefore, the statement "only after establishing initial access to victim systems" seems incorrect because some of these tools are likely used for initial access.

Moreover, in the context of targeting a specific application like Kavach, the attacker might need to perform reconnaissance and understand the environment before deploying these tools. This suggests that initial access is necessary before targeting a specific application.

However, the question is specifically about whether these infection chains are executed only after initial access. Given that some of these tools can be used for initial access, saying "only after" would exclude that possibility.

Therefore, the correct answer is likely "No," because these tools can be used for initial access as well as for subsequent stages.

To summarize:

- Malicious LNK files and HTAs can be used for initial access.

- Loader DLLs are more likely used after initial access for persistence or privilege escalation.

- Therefore, saying that these tools are used only after initial access excludes their potential use as initial access vectors.

Hence, the answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
