To answer this question, I need to consider the typical behavior of Stuxnet, especially in terms of its command and control (C2) communication mechanisms. Stuxnet is a sophisticated malware that was discovered in 2010 and is known for its complexity and specific targeting of industrial control systems, particularly those used in nuclear facilities.

First, I need to recall how Stuxnet operates in terms of propagation and communication. I know that Stuxnet used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to spread and propagate within a network. The question mentions MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities, which are indeed associated with Stuxnet's lateral movement capabilities. So, the context seems accurate.

Now, regarding C2 communication, I need to think about how Stuxnet maintained communication with its operators. From what I remember, Stuxnet used a variety of C2 channels, including both hard-coded IP addresses and domain names. It employed a peer-to-peer updating mechanism where infected machines could communicate with each other to update their payloads.

But specifically, did Stuxnet use FTP for C2 communication? I don't recall FTP being a primary protocol used by Stuxnet for C2. I believe it mainly used HTTP and sometimes DNS for communication. FTP is not something that stands out in my memory regarding Stuxnet's C2 mechanisms.

Moreover, FTP is a relatively straightforward protocol, and using it for C2 could potentially be more easily detected by network monitoring tools, especially if data is being transferred in plain text. Stuxnet, being a highly sophisticated malware, likely employed more stealthy methods for C2 communication to avoid detection.

Additionally, Stuxnet was designed to be resilient and operate even in environments with limited internet access. Using FTP might not have been the most efficient or stealthy method in such scenarios.

Therefore, based on my knowledge of Stuxnet's operations, I would say that it is unlikely that Stuxnet used FTP for C2 communication to send system information and receive commands or updates after exploiting the mentioned vulnerabilities for lateral movement.

So, the answer should be B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
