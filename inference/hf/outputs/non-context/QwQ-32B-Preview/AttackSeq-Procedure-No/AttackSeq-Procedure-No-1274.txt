To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine if the attackers likely conducted research on software code for supply-chain operations during the Reconnaissance phase, prior to using the SocGholish framework to compromise websites and deliver malicious JavaScript.

First, let's break down the components mentioned in the question:

1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: This is the initial stage of an attack where attackers gather information about their target. This can include identifying vulnerabilities, understanding the target's environment, and planning the attack vector.

2. **Supply-Chain Operations**: These involve compromising the supply chain of an organization to gain access to the target. This could mean targeting software vendors, updating systems, or other components that are part of the target's infrastructure.

3. **SocGholish Framework**: This appears to be a specific tool or method used by attackers to compromise legitimate websites. Without specific knowledge of SocGholish, I'll assume it's a known malicious framework used for such purposes.

4. **Compromising Legitimate Websites**: Attackers are using SocGholish to take over legitimate websites, likely to distribute malware without raising suspicion.

5. **Delivering Malicious JavaScript Disguised as a Browser Update**: The payload is malicious JavaScript that masquerades as a legitimate browser update, aiming to trick users into executing it.

Now, considering the sequence:

- **Reconnaissance**: Researching software code to enable supply-chain operations.

- **Action**: Using SocGholish to compromise legitimate websites.

- **Delivery**: Delivering malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.

The question is whether it's likely that the research on software code for supply-chain operations occurred during the Reconnaissance phase before using SocGholish.

To evaluate this, I need to consider if researching software code for supply-chain operations is a plausible activity in the Reconnaissance phase leading up to the actions described.

**Analysis:**

- **Supply-Chain Research in Reconnaissance**: It makes sense that attackers would research software code and supply-chain processes during the Reconnaissance phase. Understanding the supply chain can help them identify weak points to exploit, such as vulnerabilities in third-party software or update mechanisms.

- **Link to SocGholish**: If the attackers are using SocGholish to compromise legitimate websites, it's possible that this is part of their supply-chain attack. For example, they might be targeting websites that are suppliers or partners of the ultimate target organization.

- **Disguising Malware as Browser Update**: This delivery method suggests that the attackers are aiming for broad infection, possibly to gain access to multiple systems within an organization or to spread malware further through the supply chain.

Given this sequence, it seems plausible that the attackers conducted research on software code related to supply-chain operations during the Reconnaissance phase to plan their attack vectors, including the use of SocGholish to compromise websites and deliver malware.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes," it is plausible that the attackers researched software code to enable supply-chain operations as part of the Reconnaissance phase before using SocGholish to compromise websites and deliver malicious JavaScript.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
