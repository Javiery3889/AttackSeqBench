To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether it's likely that Taidoor malware would perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers, given the initial access vector and the modifications to the traffic pattern.

First, let's break down the attack sequence:

1. **Initial Access:** The attack begins with exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) through email attachments. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code, which in this case is used to drop the Taidoor malware.

2. **Decoy Document:** After exploitation, a decoy document is opened to distract the user, possibly making the attack less noticeable.

3. **Malware Deployment:** Taidoor malware is dropped onto the target system.

4. **Communication with CnC:** The malware is expected to communicate with its command and control (CnC) servers at roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

5. **Modified Traffic Pattern:** The communication pattern has been modified, suggesting some level of obfuscation or evasion technique.

Now, considering the above sequence, the question is whether it's likely that Taidoor would perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

**Anti-Sandboxing and Anti-Virtualization Techniques:**

These techniques are commonly used by malware to delay or prevent analysis in controlled environments such as sandboxes and virtual machines. By detecting these environments, malware can alter its behavior to avoid detection, such as delaying payload delivery or terminating itself.

**Likelihood Assessment:**

Given that Taidoor is a malware variant, it's plausible that it incorporates such evasion techniques. Advanced malware often includes mechanisms to detect analysis environments to evade detection and prolong its operational life on a target system.

Moreover, the fact that the traffic pattern has been modified suggests that there is an effort to evade detection, which aligns with the use of anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided and the common practices of malware to include evasion techniques, it is likely that Taidoor performs anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
