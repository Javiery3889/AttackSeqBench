To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involved in the described attack and evaluate whether the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files is a plausible step before downloading a Crimson RAT from a specified IP address.

First, let's break down the attack sequence as described:

1. **Targeting officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs:** This indicates a specific and likely high-profile target, suggesting a targeted attack rather than a mass phishing campaign.

2. **Spear phishing campaign:** Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers send personalized messages to specific individuals to gain access to sensitive information or systems.

3. **Use of social media channels to deliver malicious files:** This technique involves leveraging social media platforms to distribute malware or malicious links.

4. **Downloading a Crimson RAT from a specified IP address:** A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that provides attackers with remote control over the victim's system. Crimson RAT is a specific type of RAT.

Now, let's consider whether it is likely that the attack will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files before downloading the Crimson RAT.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Spear Phishing and Social Engineering:** Spear phishing often involves social engineering techniques to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or opening infected attachments. Social media is a common vector for such attacks because it allows attackers to gather information about their targets and craft more convincing messages.

2. **Delivery Mechanism:** In many cyberattacks, especially targeted ones, attackers use multiple stages to deliver their payload. The first stage might be to get the victim to click on a link or open an attachment that then leads to the download of more malicious software.

3. **Use of Social Media:** Social media platforms are widely used and can be an effective way to reach high-profile targets. Attackers can create fake profiles, send direct messages, or post malicious links in groups or pages that the target is likely to engage with.

4. **Downloading the RAT:** Once the initial payload is delivered through social media, it can execute a script or executable that connects back to a command and control server (specified IP address) to download the Crimson RAT.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**

- **Option A: Yes**

  - This option suggests that it is likely the attack will involve social media channels to deliver malicious files before downloading the Crimson RAT.

  - Given that spear phishing often uses social engineering and that social media is a popular vector for such attacks, this seems plausible.

- **Option B: No**

  - This option suggests that it is not likely the attack will involve social media channels for delivering malicious files.

  - This could be the case if there are other more likely delivery mechanisms or if social media is not considered a effective vector for this particular attack.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the nature of spear phishing attacks and the utility of social media in delivering malicious content, it is reasonable to conclude that social media channels could be used to deliver malicious files as part of this attack sequence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
