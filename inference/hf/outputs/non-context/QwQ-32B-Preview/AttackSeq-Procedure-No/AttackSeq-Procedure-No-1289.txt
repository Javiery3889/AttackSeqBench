To answer this question, we need to analyze the behavior of the threat actor known as Mustang Panda and determine if they are likely to use the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaign, given that they are already using documents to communicate with C2 servers.

First, let's understand who Mustang Panda is. Mustang Panda is a Chinese state-sponsored threat group known for its cyber espionage activities. They have been observed using various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to infiltrate targets and maintain persistence.

The question mentions that Mustang Panda is using documents to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses. This suggests that they are employing malware or malicious documents that can communicate with their command and control servers once they gain access to a target's system.

Now, the double extension trick involves using file names with two extensions, such as "sample.doc.lnk." The idea is that the operating system may interpret the file based on the last extension, potentially misleading users into thinking it's a different type of file. For example, "sample.doc.lnk" might appear to users as a Word document, but it's actually a shortcut file, which could execute malicious code when opened.

So, the question is whether Mustang Panda is likely to use this specific trick in their spearphishing campaign.

To answer this, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Tactics and Procedures**: We need to look at the TTPs typically used by Mustang Panda. If they have previously used social engineering tactics like spearphishing with malicious attachments, and if they have used tricks to make these attachments appear benign, then using the double extension trick could be plausible.

2. **Evasion Techniques**: The double extension trick is a method to evade user suspicion and potentially some security controls. If Mustang Panda is known to employ such evasion techniques, then it's likely they would use this trick.

3. **Target Audience**: The effectiveness of such tricks depends on the target audience. If the targets are likely to be fooled by double extensions, then Mustang Panda might find this technique useful.

4. **Alternatives**: We should also consider if there are more effective or less risky methods available to Mustang Panda for their phishing campaigns.

Let's consider each point in detail:

1. **Tactics and Procedures**:

   - Mustang Panda has been known to use spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to target networks.

   - They have used various document types, such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PDFs, which are common vectors for delivering malware.

   - In some cases, they have used document exploitation techniques, such as embedding malicious macros or exploiting vulnerabilities in document parsing.

   - Therefore, it is plausible that they would use additional tricks to make their attachments more enticing or less suspicious.

2. **Evasion Techniques**:

   - The double extension trick is a social engineering ploy to make a file appear as a harmless document when it's actually a different type of file.

   - Users might be trained to be cautious of .exe files but may trust .doc files. By using a double extension like .doc.lnk, the file might bypass some user scrutiny.

   - However, modern email filters and security software can detect such tricks, so their effectiveness might be limited.

   - Given that Mustang Panda is a sophisticated threat group, they are likely aware of such techniques and may use them as part of their toolkit.

3. **Target Audience**:

   - The success of the double extension trick depends on the target's familiarity with file extensions and their security awareness.

   - If the targets are not tech-savvy or are not trained to recognize such tricks, they might fall for it.

   - Mustang Panda likely conducts reconnaissance on their targets to tailor their phishing attempts effectively.

4. **Alternatives**:

   - There are other methods to make malicious files appear benign, such as using archive files with password prompts or exploiting trusted file types.

   - Additionally, Mustang Panda might use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) or other C2 communication methods to maintain control over compromised systems.

   - Therefore, while the double extension trick is one possible method, it may not be the only or even the primary method they use.

Given this analysis, it seems plausible that Mustang Panda could use the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaigns, especially if it aligns with their existing TTPs and helps them evade detection.

However, the question is whether they are "likely" to use this trick, given that they are already using documents to communicate with C2 servers.

Considering that Mustang Panda is a sophisticated actor, they probably have a repertoire of techniques to obfuscate their malware and evade defenses. Using double extensions is just one among many possible tactics.

But, to determine likelihood, we need to look at their past behavior and see if they have used similar tricks in the past.

Upon reviewing available reports on Mustang Panda, there isn't explicit mention of their use of double extensions in their phishing attachments. However, they have employed various social engineering techniques and file type deceptions.

Given that, and considering that the double extension trick is a known technique used by other threat actors, it is possible that Mustang Panda may use it as well.

But, without concrete evidence that they have used this specific trick, we cannot say with certainty that they are likely to use it.

Therefore, the answer to the question is probably "No," meaning that it is not necessarily likely that Mustang Panda will use the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaign, at least based on the information provided.

However, it's essential to note that threat actors continually evolve their tactics, and just because they haven't been observed using a particular technique in the past doesn't mean they won't in the future.

In conclusion, while the double extension trick is a possible method for evading defenses, there isn't sufficient evidence to confirm that Mustang Panda is likely to use it in their spearphishing campaigns, especially given that they already have other methods in place for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: B**
