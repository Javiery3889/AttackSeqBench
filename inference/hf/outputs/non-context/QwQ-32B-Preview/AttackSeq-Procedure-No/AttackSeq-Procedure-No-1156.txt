So I've got this question here about attackers who've collected Instagram credentials through phishing sites. It's asking whether it's likely that these attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The sequence of events seems to be:

1. Attackers set up phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials.

2. They successfully collect victims' credentials.

3. Before changing the passwords to lock out the original owners, they stop specific services related to backups.

The question is whether this sequence is likely.

Okay, let's break this down.

**Step 1: Understanding the Attack Sequence**

Phishing for credentials is a common tactic. Attackers create fake login pages that mimic legitimate ones, like Instagram's, to trick users into entering their usernames and passwords. Once they have these credentials, they can log in to the victims' accounts.

**Step 2: Considering the Next Steps**

After gaining access, attackers might want to maintain control over the account. One way to do this is by changing the password, which locks out the original owner.

But the question introduces an additional step: stopping specific services related to backups before changing the password.

**Step 3: Evaluating the Plausibility**

I need to think about why attackers might want to disable backup services before changing passwords.

Backups can be a way for the original owner to restore their account to a previous state, potentially reversing any changes made by the attacker, including password changes.

By disabling backup services, attackers may be trying to prevent the victim from restoring their account and regaining access.

**Step 4: Considering the Feasibility**

Is it feasible for attackers to disable backup services?

Well, that depends on how backups are set up. If Instagram offers backup services that can be controlled within the account settings, then yes, an attacker with access to the account could potentially disable them.

However, I'm not entirely sure about Instagram's specific backup features. Maybe I should look that up.

**Step 5: Researching Instagram's Backup Features**

Upon a quick search, I find that Instagram doesn't have a built-in backup feature for posts in the same way that some other platforms do. Users can download their data, including posts and comments, but there isn't a real-time backup service that can be enabled or disabled within the app.

So, if Instagram doesn't have active backup services that can be toggled, then the idea of attackers stopping backup services before changing passwords doesn't make much sense.

**Step 6: Reevaluating the Question**

Given that Instagram doesn't seem to have adjustable backup services within the app, the scenario presented in the question might not be applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to third-party backup services that users might be employing, but that seems less likely, as attackers might not have control over those services.

**Step 7: Considering the Likelihood**

Given the above, it's unlikely that attackers would need to stop specific backup services before changing passwords on Instagram, simply because such services aren't a standard feature of the platform.

Therefore, the answer should be "No," it's not likely that attackers will stop specific services related to backups before changing passwords.

**Final Answer: B: No**
