So I've got this question here about a cyber attack scenario. It seems like some bad actors are looking into medical infrastructure, using tools like masscan to find vulnerabilities in systems that manage buildings and printers. Specifically, they're targeting Building Management systems that use something called the Niagara Fox protocol and printer web interfaces that don't require authentication. The question is asking whether, during the discovery phase of this attack, it's likely that they'll be able to retrieve metadata for files on disk or get listings of files and directories.

Let's break this down. First, I need to understand what's happening in this scenario. The attackers are doing reconnaissance, which is the initial step where they gather information about their target. They're using masscan, which is a fast port scanner, to find open ports on the target's network. Open ports can indicate services that are running, like web servers, database servers, or in this case, Building Management systems and printer interfaces.

Building Management systems, especially those using the Niagara Fox protocol, are used to control and monitor various aspects of a building's operations, like heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, and security systems. If these systems are exposed to the internet without proper authentication, they can be vulnerable to attacks.

Similarly, printer web interfaces that don't require authentication are also a security risk because anyone can access them and potentially exploit them.

Now, the question is asking about the discovery phase, which is likely part of the attack chain where attackers try to learn more about the target's environment, identify valuable assets, and find ways to access them.

So, regarding whether metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during this phase, I need to think about what kind of information these systems might expose.

First, Building Management systems using Niagara Fox: I'm not entirely familiar with this protocol, but from what I can recall, it's used for communication between different devices in a building's automation system. It might not directly expose file systems or metadata, but if the system is running on a vulnerable server or has poor security configurations, it's possible that an attacker could find a way to access underlying file systems.

As for printers with unauthenticated web interfaces, these often have web-based management portals where administrators can configure settings, view logs, and manage print jobs. Some printers may expose file listings or metadata if there are vulnerabilities in their firmware or if they have misconfigurations.

However, typically, printers and Building Management systems are not designed to store or expose sensitive files or metadata. Their primary functions are to manage physical infrastructure and printing tasks, respectively. So, it might not be likely that an attacker would find valuable file metadata or directory listings directly from these systems.

But, in the context of a broader attack, gaining access to these systems could provide a foothold into the network, allowing attackers to move laterally and access other more sensitive systems that do store valuable data.

Given that, I would say that directly from these systems, it's not very likely that they would retrieve metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings. Therefore, the answer would be "No."

Wait a minute, but I should consider that some Building Management systems might have logging capabilities that store data in files, and if the system is compromised, an attacker might be able to access those logs, which could contain some metadata.

Similarly, if the printer servers are poorly segregated from the rest of the network, gaining access to them could potentially allow an attacker to jump to other systems where file metadata and directory listings are available.

However, based on the information provided in the question, it seems that the focus is on the initial discovery phase through reconnaissance of these specific systems.

So, considering that, I think the most accurate answer is "No," because these systems are not typically used to store files or metadata that an attacker would be interested in during the discovery phase.

But perhaps I should look at this from another angle. Maybe the attackers are looking for ways to exploit these systems to gain more information about the network or to find credentials that could be used to access other systems.

For example, if the Building Management system has been configured to communicate with other systems using plaintext protocols or if it stores passwords in plaintext, an attacker could potentially access that information.

Similarly, printer configurations might include network shares or other connections that could expose more about the network structure.

In that case, it's possible that some metadata or directory listings could be retrieved indirectly through these systems.

Given that, maybe the answer is "Yes," it is likely that some metadata or directory listings could be retrieved during the discovery phase by exploiting these systems.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more of a maybe, but since the answer choices are only "Yes" or "No," I need to pick one.

Considering that these systems are not primary targets for file data, but could potentially provide indirect access to such data, I'm going to lean towards "No," unless there's a specific known vulnerability in Niagara Fox or unauthenticated printer interfaces that directly expose file metadata, which I'm not aware of.

Therefore, my final answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
