To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and determine whether data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client is likely during the Collection phase, given that RYUK ransomware was deployed using manual and scripted methods, including remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **RYUK Ransomware Deployment:**
   - Deployed a week later.
   - Both manual and scripted methods were used.
   - Remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec.

2. **Data Exfiltration:**
   - Using SmartFTP Client.
   - During the Collection phase.

RYUK is a well-known ransomware variant that often involves a multi-stage attack, where initial access is gained, followed by lateral movement, persistence, data exfiltration, and finally, ransomware deployment.

Given this context, let's consider the timeline and phases of a typical RYUK attack:

- **Initial Access:** Attackers gain initial foothold in the network.
- **Discovery:** Attackers map the network and identify valuable assets.
- **Lateral Movement:** Attackers move laterally within the network to access more systems.
- **Persistence:** Attackers establish persistent access to the network.
- **Collection:** Attackers exfiltrate data, often to blackmail the victim or to demand an additional ransom.
- **Action on Objectives:** Deploy ransomware to encrypt files and demand ransom.

According to the question, RYUK ransomware was deployed a week later using manual and scripted methods, including WMI and PsExec. This suggests that the attackers had already completed the lateral movement and persistence phases, as they are able to deploy the ransomware across the network using these methods.

Now, regarding the Collection phase and data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client:

- **Collection Phase:** This is typically a phase where attackers gather sensitive data to exfiltrate from the network.
- **SmartFTP Client:** This is a legitimate FTP client that could be abused by attackers to transfer files out of the network.

Given that the ransomware was deployed a week later, it's possible that the Collection phase occurred before the ransomware deployment. In many ransomware attacks, including RYUK, data exfiltration happens prior to deploying the ransomware to increase pressure on the victim to pay the ransom.

However, the question is asking whether it's likely that data was exfiltrated using SmartFTP Client during the Collection phase, given the methods used for ransomware deployment.

Let's consider the following points:

1. **Timeline:** Since the ransomware was deployed a week later, there was sufficient time for the attackers to perform the Collection phase.

2. **Methods Used for Ransomware Deployment:**
   - WMI command execution and PsExec indicate that the attackers have administrative privileges and can execute commands remotely on multiple systems.
   - These methods are typically used for lateral movement and persistence.

3. **Data Exfiltration Methods:**
   - Using SmartFTP Client for exfiltration is plausible, as FTP is a common protocol for file transfer.
   - However, attackers often use more stealthy methods for exfiltration to avoid detection.

4. **Likelihood:**
   - Given that RYUK attacks often involve data exfiltration, it's likely that a Collection phase occurred.
   - Using SmartFTP Client is possible, but it's just one of many tools that could be used for exfiltration.

Considering these points, it's plausible that data was exfiltrated using SmartFTP Client during the Collection phase. However, the question is whether it's likely, given the information provided.

Given that the question specifies the methods used for ransomware deployment but doesn't provide direct information about the Collection phase, we have to make an inference based on typical attack patterns.

Since RYUK attacks commonly involve data exfiltration before deploying ransomware, and SmartFTP Client is a possible tool for exfiltration, it's reasonable to conclude that data was likely exfiltrated using SmartFTP Client during the Collection phase.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
