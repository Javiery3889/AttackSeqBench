To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of actions described and determine whether the Rising Sun implant would collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

First, let's break down the sequence of events mentioned in the question:

1. **Persistence**: The implant ensures persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process. This suggests that the initial infection vector has already occurred, and the implant is taking steps to maintain access to the compromised system.

2. **Discovery Activities**: After establishing persistence, the implant likely engages in discovery activities to gather information about the compromised host and potentially the broader network. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle, as it helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Communication with Control Servers**: Finally, the implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests to exfiltrate data or receive further instructions.

Now, the question specifically asks whether it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers.

To answer this, I need to consider the following points:

- **Purpose of Collecting MAC Address**: The MAC address is a unique identifier for network interfaces. Collecting it could help the attacker identify the host uniquely within the network, understand the network topology, or correlate with other collected data.

- **Commonality of Collecting MAC Address**: Many malware strains collect various system information, including MAC addresses, as part of their standard information-gathering routines. This information can be useful for targeting specific systems or avoiding detection.

- **Timing of Collection**: The question specifies that this collection occurs as part of the discovery activities before communicating with control servers. This makes sense because the implant would likely gather as much information as possible about the compromised environment before reaching out to its command and control servers.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that collecting the MAC address is a plausible action for the Rising Sun implant during its discovery phase.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
