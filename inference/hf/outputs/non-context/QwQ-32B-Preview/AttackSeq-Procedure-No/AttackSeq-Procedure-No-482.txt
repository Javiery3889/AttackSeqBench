I've got this question here about a malware called FamousSparrow and its behavior after using something called SparrowDoor. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what FamousSparrow and SparrowDoor are. From what I can gather, FamousSparrow seems to be a type of malware, and SparrowDoor might be a backdoor or a component used for maintaining access to the compromised system.

The question states that SparrowDoor is used to communicate with the C&C (Command and Control) server using HTTPS protocol and employs multi-byte XOR keys for encrypted communications. This suggests that the malware is trying to hide its communications by using encryption to avoid detection.

Now, the question is asking whether FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after using SparrowDoor.

Let's think about this. Exfiltrating data at regular intervals, like every 10 minutes, could be a strategy used by malware to systematically steal information from the compromised system. Using a scheduled transfer method makes sense because it can help avoid drawing attention by causing network spikes at irregular intervals.

Given that SparrowDoor is already set up for communication with the C&C server using HTTPS and encryption, it's plausible that the malware would use this established communication channel to exfiltrate data at regular intervals.

However, I need to consider whether this specific behavior is likely for FamousSparrow. Malware behaviors can vary widely, and not all malware exfiltrates data at fixed intervals. Some may do it based on certain triggers, data size, or other factors.

But in this case, the question provides specific details about the use of SparrowDoor for communication, and it's asking about a specific exfiltration schedule. Given that, and assuming that FamousSparrow is designed to exfiltrate data, scheduling transfers every 10 minutes could be a feasible approach.

Moreover, using HTTPS and multi-byte XOR keys indicates that the malware authors are attempting to hide their traffic, which aligns with the need to exfiltrate data without being detected.

Therefore, considering all these factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after utilizing SparrowDoor.

So, my answer would be:

Final Answer: A: Yes
