So I've got this question here about phishing and account takeovers on Instagram. Let's break it down step by step. The question is: After impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges, is it likely that the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords only before using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials? And the answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events described here. It seems like there's a phishing attack where the bad guys are pretending to be technical support or friends. They send messages to victims, either claiming that there's a copyright violation or offering them a verified badge, which is something that might entice someone on social media.

So, the attackers are sending these phishing messages to trick people into giving up their login information. Now, the question is asking whether it's likely that after doing this, the attackers would change the account passwords to lock out the original owners before using phishing sites to collect more credentials.

Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. Let's see. If the attackers have already collected the usernames and passwords through phishing, why would they need to change the passwords to lock out the original owners? Wouldn't changing the password be a way to maintain control over the account once they've gained access?

Wait, actually, if they change the password after gaining access, that would prevent the original owner from logging back in, ensuring that the attackers keep control of the account. That makes sense.

But then the question mentions "before using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials." So, are the attackers going to set up phishing sites to collect more credentials after they've already gained access and changed the passwords?

This seems a bit out of sequence. Typically, in a phishing attack, the bad guys create a phishing site to trick victims into entering their credentials, which the attackers then collect. Once they have the credentials, they can log into the accounts and do whatever they want, including changing passwords to lock out the original owners.

So, in the normal sequence, it's:

1. Create phishing sites.

2. Send phishing messages pretending to be technical support or friends.

3. Trick victims into entering their credentials on the phishing site.

4. Collect the credentials.

5. Log into the accounts using the stolen credentials.

6. Change the passwords to lock out the original owners.

But the question is suggesting that the password change happens before using phishing sites to collect credentials. That doesn't align with the typical sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that after the initial phishing attempt, the attackers change the passwords to lock out the owners, and then set up phishing sites to collect more credentials from other victims. But that doesn't make much sense because once they've taken over an account, why would they need to set up more phishing sites to collect credentials? They already have the credentials they need to control the account.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the sequence. Let's look at it again.

"After impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges, is it likely that the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords only before using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials?"

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. Attackers impersonate technical support or friends and send phishing messages about copyright violations or verified badges.

2. Victims click on these messages and are directed to phishing sites where they enter their credentials.

3. Attackers collect these credentials.

4. Attackers log into the accounts and change the passwords to lock out the original owners.

5. Then, the attackers use phishing sites again to collect more credentials.

But step 5 seems redundant. Once they've taken over the account by changing the password, why would they need to set up more phishing sites to collect additional credentials? They already have control of the account.

Alternatively, maybe the attackers are using the taken-over accounts to spread more phishing messages, leading to more phishing sites collecting credentials. But that would be a continuation of the attack, not part of the initial sequence.

I think there's some confusion in the way the question is phrased. It's mixing up the sequence of events in a way that doesn't quite make sense.

Let me consider the answer choices. A: Yes, and B: No.

If I had to choose, I would go with B: No. Here's why:

In a typical account takeover scenario via phishing:

- Attackers create phishing sites to collect victims' credentials.

- They send phishing messages pretending to be legitimate entities (like technical support or friends).

- Victims enter their credentials on the phishing site.

- Attackers collect these credentials and use them to log into the accounts.

- Once inside, attackers may change passwords to lock out the original owners.

- They might also use the compromised account to spread more phishing messages or engage in other malicious activities.

So, in this standard sequence, changing the passwords to lock out the original owners comes after collecting the credentials, not before setting up the phishing sites.

The question seems to suggest that after impersonating technical support or friends and sending phishing messages, attackers will change account passwords before using phishing sites to collect credentials. This doesn't align with the typical sequence, as the phishing sites are used to collect credentials in the first place.

Therefore, it's not likely that attackers would change account passwords before setting up phishing sites to collect credentials, because they need the credentials first to access and control the accounts.

Hence, the answer should be B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
