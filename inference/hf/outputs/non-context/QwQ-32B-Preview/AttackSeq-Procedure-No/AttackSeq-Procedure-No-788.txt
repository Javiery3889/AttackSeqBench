To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if it's plausible that the Higaisa APT group would follow this path in their operations.

First, let's break down the sequence:

1. **Distribution of malicious LNK files**: These are disguised as CVs or IELTS exam results and are sent via spear-phishing emails.

2. **Compromise of legitimate web browser updates**: After initial access, the group plans to use this method to deliver a backdoor.

I need to evaluate if this sequence makes sense and if it aligns with known APT group behaviors, specifically Higaisa.

**Step 1: Understanding Higaisa APT Group**

Higaisa, also known as BlackTech or Zebrocy, is a threat group primarily associated with espionage activities, particularly targeting government entities, think tanks, and diplomatic organizations. They are known for their use of spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Initial Compromise**

The initial vector mentioned is spear-phishing emails containing malicious LNK files disguised as CVs or IELTS exam results. This aligns with Higaisa's known tactics. They often use social engineering techniques to trick victims into opening malicious files, and using documents that seem legitimate, like CVs or test results, is a common ploy.

**Step 3: Evaluating the Subsequent Step**

After gaining initial access through the malicious LNK files, the question suggests that Higaisa might compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.

**Compromising Browser Updates**

Compromising software update mechanisms is a sophisticated technique that involves intercepting or modifying legitimate update processes to inject malicious code. This is a high-risk operation because it requires a deep understanding of the update mechanism and the ability to maintain persistence without being detected by both the software vendor and end-users.

**Is This Plausible for Higaisa?**

Higaisa is known for its association with espionage activities and has been linked to state-sponsored operations. State-sponsored groups often have the resources and capabilities to undertake complex operations, including compromising software supply chains.

However, compromising browser updates is an advanced technique that not all APT groups may employ. It requires significant resources and could have severe consequences if exposed, including legal repercussions and damage to national interests.

**Alternative Methods**

More commonly, APT groups use other methods to maintain persistence and distribute backdoors, such as:

- **Exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate software**.

- **Using living-off-the-land binaries**.

- **Creating fake update servers**.

- **Leveraging legitimate administrative tools**.

**Step 4: Weighing the Plausibility**

Given that Higaisa is known for spear-phishing and using malicious attachments, the initial part of the sequence is plausible. However, the subsequent step of compromising legitimate browser updates seems more ambitious and risky than their known capabilities.

While it's not impossible for Higaisa to attempt such a technique, especially if backed by a nation-state with significant resources, it might be beyond their typical operational scope.

**Step 5: Considering the Likelihood**

Considering the above points, it's more likely that Higaisa would use more conventional methods to deliver a backdoor after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files. These methods are generally less risky and require fewer resources.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, it is not likely that Higaisa APT group will compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor after distributing malicious LNK files. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
