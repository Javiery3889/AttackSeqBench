To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is about Iranian state-backed hackers who used phishing attacks through email and social media to target individuals involved in sanctions against Iran. The question is whether, after gaining initial access through these phishing attacks, it's likely that they scanned specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach.

So, we need to consider the sequence of events here:

1. **Initial Access via Phishing:** The hackers used phishing attacks through email and social media to target specific individuals involved in sanctions against Iran. This suggests that they already had a list of targets they were interested in.

2. **Tailoring the Targeting Approach:** After gaining initial access, the question is whether they would scan specific lists of target IP addresses to further tailor their approach.

Now, let's think about why they might do this.

**Possible Reasons for Scanning IP Addresses:**

- **To Identify Additional Targets:** Once they have access to initial targets, they might want to expand their reach within the organization or related entities by scanning IP addresses to find more potential victims.

- **To Understand the Network Topology:** Scanning IP addresses can help them map out the network structure, identify high-value targets, and plan further attacks.

- **To Deploy Malware or Backdoors:** Scanning can be a part of deploying malware or setting up backdoors on specific systems within the target network.

However, considering that they have already gained initial access through targeted phishing, it might be more efficient for them to move laterally within the network using other techniques rather than scanning IP addresses.

**Alternative Approaches:**

- **Lateral Movement:** Using techniques like credential dumping, pass-the-hash, or exploiting trust relationships to move within the network.

- **Internal Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the internal network from the compromised systems without necessarily scanning IP addresses.

Given that they have already targeted specific individuals, it's possible that they have a good idea about the internal network structure or can obtain it through the compromised systems.

**Is IP Scanning Necessary or Likely?**

IP scanning can be noisy and might trigger security alerts, which could compromise their operation. Since they have already gained access through targeted phishing, they might prefer to proceed with more stealthy techniques.

Moreover, state-sponsored actors are typically sophisticated and cautious, aiming to maintain persistence and avoid detection. Therefore, they might avoid activities that could raise alarms.

**Conclusion:**

Given the context, it's not necessarily likely that they would scan specific lists of target IP addresses after gaining initial access through targeted phishing. They might have other, more discreet methods to achieve their objectives.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
