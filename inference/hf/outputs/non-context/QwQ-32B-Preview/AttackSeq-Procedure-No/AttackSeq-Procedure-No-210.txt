To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned and determine the most plausible sequence based on the attack scenario described.

First, let's break down the question:

1. The backdoor in question is called "Milestone."

2. It has employed two initial techniques:

   a. System information discovery

   b. Screen capture capabilities

3. The question is whether, after these actions, it is likely that Milestone will communicate with a command and control (C2) server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.

Now, let's look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To determine the most plausible answer, I need to consider the typical behavior of malware, specifically backdoors, and how they operate in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, system information discovery is a common initial step for malware to gather details about the compromised system. This can include information like system architecture, installed software, running processes, and network configuration. This information is valuable for the attacker to understand the environment and decide on the next steps.

Screen capture capabilities suggest that the backdoor is designed to collect visual data from the victim's machine, which could be used for various purposes such as stealing credentials, observing user behavior, or capturing sensitive information displayed on the screen.

Given these initial actions, it is logical to assume that the backdoor would need to communicate this collected information back to the attacker's C2 server. This communication is a crucial step in the exfiltration process.

Now, regarding the communication over a non-standard port: Malware often uses non-standard ports to evade detection by security systems that may be monitoring standard ports. For example, instead of using port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS, the malware might use a less monitored port to establish its C2 channel.

Therefore, it is plausible that Milestone would communicate with its C2 server over a non-standard port to avoid detection.

Furthermore, exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel is a common practice, as it simplifies the communication and reduces the number of channels that need to be managed.

Considering all these points, the sequence makes sense:

1. System information discovery

2. Screen capture

3. Communication with C2 over a non-standard port

4. Exfiltration of data through the C2 channel

This sequence aligns with typical malware behavior and the principles of stealth and evasion.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes," which is option A.

Final Answer: A
