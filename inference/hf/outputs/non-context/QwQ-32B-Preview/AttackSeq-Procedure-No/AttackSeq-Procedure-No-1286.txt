So I've got this question here about Turla operators and their tactics. Let me try to understand what's being asked. It says that after setting up a hidden foothold in infected networks, they have persistent access to search other computers and store stolen information. Then, the question is whether it's likely that they will set auto-forward rules on victims' email accounts to collect data before updating their command and control (C2) servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems.

First, I need to know who Turla is. Turla is a sophisticated cyber threat group that has been active since at least 2008. They are known for their complex and stealthy operations, often targeting government agencies, diplomatic missions, and research institutions.

Now, the question is asking about a specific sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Let's break it down:

1. Establishing a hidden foothold: This likely refers to installing malware or backdoors on the target systems to maintain access.

2. Searching other computers: Once inside, they look for other systems to compromise within the network.

3. Storing stolen information: They collect data and store it somewhere, probably on the infected systems or exfiltrate it to their C2 servers.

4. Setting auto-forward rules on email accounts: This suggests they might configure email servers or clients to automatically forward emails to addresses they control, allowing them to collect more data without direct access.

5. Updating C2 servers worldwide: This implies they change or update the servers that their malware communicates with to maintain control over the infected systems and possibly to evade detection.

The question is whether it's likely that Turla operators will perform steps 4 and 5 in this sequence after steps 1-3.

Let me think about this in terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversarial behaviors. Turla's activities can be mapped to various techniques in this framework.

First, establishing a foothold could involve techniques like Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001), where they send malicious emails to gain initial access.

Then, searching other computers might involve techniques like Local Network Share Discovery (T1135) or Network Service Scanning (T1046) to map the network and find valuable targets.

Storing stolen information could be achieved through Data Staged (T1074) where they collect data in a central location before exfiltration.

Setting auto-forward rules on email accounts aligns with the technique Account Manipulation (T1098), specifically configuring email forwards.

Updating C2 servers worldwide might relate to Command and Control (C2) masquerading or using common protocols to blend in with normal traffic.

Now, considering the sequence: after setting up a foothold, searching, and storing data, would they set up email forwards and then update their C2 infrastructure?

Well, setting up email forwards seems like a way to continuously collect data, especially if the victims are using email for communication. This could be a long-term data collection method, allowing them to monitor communications without having to directly access the systems frequently, which could reduce the risk of detection.

Updating C2 servers worldwide might be part of their strategy to maintain operational security and evade defensive measures. By changing C2 servers, they can avoid being traced and blocked.

So, logically, it makes sense that after gaining initial access and setting up a foothold, they would look to establish持续的数据收集机制，如自动转发电子邮件，以持续获取信息。然后，为了保持对受感染系统的控制并避免被发现，他们可能会定期更新其命令和控制服务器。

因此，从这个角度来看，答案应该是“是的”，这是很有可能的。

但是，我需要考虑一下其他因素。也许Turla有其他的偏好或已知的TTP，使得这个序列不那么可能。

根据公开的威胁情报报告，Turla确实以其复杂和长期的运营而闻名。他们被观察到使用多种技术来维持对目标网络的访问，并且经常更新其工具和基础设施以逃避检测。

此外，Turla与俄罗斯有关联，其目标往往具有地缘政治意义。因此，他们可能会特别关注持续的数据收集和长期的网络存在。

在MITRE ATT&CK框架中，Turla与多个技术相关联，包括但不限于：

- 使用恶意文档进行初始访问 (T1566.001)

- 利用合法工具进行侦察和 lateral movement (T1218)

- 使用自定义恶意软件 (T1559)

- 数据压缩和加密以进行 exfiltration (T1090, T1571)

- 定期更新 C2 服务器以保持隐蔽性

因此，设置自动转发规则和更新 C2 服务器都符合 Turla 的已知行为。

再者，设置自动转发规则可以被视为一种被动的数据收集方法，允许他们在不活跃于网络的情况下仍然获取信息。这与他们追求长期、低关注度的存在相一致。

因此，综合考虑，我认为答案是“是的”，这是很可能的。
