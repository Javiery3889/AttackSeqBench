To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of events in a cyber attack and how the different phases relate to each other, particularly focusing on the Initial Access and Resource Development phases as per the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's clarify the terms and phases mentioned:

1. **Initial Access**: This is the phase where an adversary tries to gain their first foothold into a target's network. This can be achieved through various methods such as phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.

2. **Resource Development**: This phase isn't a standard phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The framework outlines phases such as Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact. It's possible that "Resource Development" refers to activities that support the attack, such as developing or acquiring malware tools.

Given that, I'll interpret "Resource Development" as the phase where adversaries prepare their tools and resources needed for the attack, which might include creating or obtaining malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor.

Now, let's analyze the question:

- The adversary sends emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to "ENVYSCOUT" during the Initial Access phase. This sounds like a phishing attempt where the PDF likely contains a malicious link or payload designed to exploit the target.

- The question asks whether it is likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

To answer this, I need to consider whether the development and use of custom malware would typically occur before or after the initial access.

Custom malware development would generally be part of the preparation phase before launching the attack. Adversaries would create or acquire the necessary tools, including backdoors and other malicious software, to carry out their objectives.

In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the development of such tools would fall under the "Tool" tactic, which is more of a preparatory step rather than a phase in the attack lifecycle.

However, considering the question's structure, it seems to suggest a sequence where Initial Access is followed by Resource Development.

Given that, it's plausible that after gaining initial access through phishing, the adversary would then deploy their custom malware as part of establishing a foothold or gaining persistence.

But, to align with the phases in the MITRE framework, using malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor would likely correspond to tactics such as Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation, rather than a separate "Resource Development" phase.

Despite this, considering the question's phrasing, it seems to be asking whether, after achieving initial access via phishing, the adversary would then proceed to use custom malware during the Resource Development phase.

Given that, and interpreting Resource Development as a phase where the adversary sets up their resources within the target network, the answer would be:

**A: Yes**

This is because, after gaining initial access, adversaries typically deploy malware to maintain access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network. Custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor would be used during these subsequent steps to achieve the adversary's objectives.

However, if Resource Development is interpreted as the phase before Initial Access, where the adversary prepares their tools, then the answer would be different.

But based on the question's sequence—Initial Access followed by Resource Development—it's more logical to consider Resource Development as the phase after Initial Access, where the adversary establishes their resources within the network.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Yes**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
