To answer this question, I need to analyze the given scenario and evaluate whether the Lazarus group, after establishing command and control (C2) communication using backdoor malware, is likely to engage in double-extortion ransomware activities. The answer choices are "Yes" and "No," so I need to determine which one is more plausible based on the information provided.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. **Actor**: Lazarus group - This is a well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group associated with North Korea. They are known for their sophisticated cyber operations, including espionage, cyber attacks, and financial gain activities.

2. **Initial Action**: Established C2 communication using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6). Backdoors allow persistent access to the compromised system, enabling the attackers to control the system remotely and perform various actions without being detected.

3. **Purpose of Backdoor**: To poll remote C2 servers for tasks and execute commands. This indicates that the attackers have set up a infrastructure to manage their operations and can issue commands to the compromised systems as needed.

Now, the question is whether, after achieving this level of access and control, it is likely that the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them to force victims to pay a ransom.

To evaluate this, I need to consider the following points:

- **Modus Operandi of Lazarus Group**: Lazarus is known for a wide range of activities, including espionage, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, banking trojans, and cryptocurrency theft. They have also been involved in ransomware attacks, although double-extortion ransomware is more commonly associated with groups like REvil or Darkside.

- **Double-Extortion Ransomware Trend**: Double-extortion ransomware has become a prevalent tactic in recent years, where attackers exfiltrate sensitive data before encrypting it, threatening to leak the data if the ransom is not paid.

- **Plausibility of Transition**: Given that the group has already established a foothold in the network through backdoors and has control over the systems, moving to exfiltrate data and then encrypting it for ransom is a logical next step. This would allow them to maximize their gains by not only demanding a ransom for the decryption key but also threatening to release stolen data.

- **Alignment with Group's Goals**: Lazarus group is known to conduct operations for both political and financial motives. Engaging in double-extortion ransomware aligns with their capability to conduct complex cyber operations and their interest in generating revenue, especially considering the financial sanctions against North Korea.

- **Evidence of Such Activities**: There have been instances where Lazarus group has been linked to ransomware attacks, although double-extortion specifically might not be as prominently associated with them compared to other groups. However, their adaptability and the evolving nature of cyber threats suggest that they could adopt such tactics.

Considering these points, it is plausible that after establishing C2 communication via backdoor malware, the Lazarus group could proceed to engage in double-extortion ransomware activities. Their capabilities, motives, and the general trend in cybercrime support this likelihood.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
