So I've got this question here about the Infamous Chisel malware. It says that this malware automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. Then it asks whether, after doing that, it's likely to perform a SYN flood attack on a host. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand what's being asked. Chisel is described as malware that exfiltrates files using Tor and SSH. Tor is an anonymity network, and SSH is a protocol for secure communication. So, it's using these tools to secretly send files somewhere. Then, the question is whether it's likely to follow that up with a SYN flood attack.

A SYN flood attack is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack where the attacker sends a large number of TCP SYN requests to a target's system, aiming to consume resources and make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

So, is it likely that after exfiltrating files, this malware would perform a SYN flood attack?

I need to think about the objectives of malware. Generally, malware is designed with specific goals in mind, such as stealing data, disrupting services, or maintaining access to a network. The actions it takes are usually aligned with these goals.

In this case, Chisel is exfiltrating files, which suggests that its primary goal is to steal data. Performing a SYN flood attack after exfiltration might serve a different purpose, such as covering the tracks by taking down the system or distracting administrators.

However, whether it's likely or not depends on the malware's design and the attacker's intentions. Some malware is designed to perform multiple types of attacks, while others have a more focused purpose.

To answer this question, I should consider whether it's common for data exfiltration malware to also perform DoS attacks. From what I know, these are often separate stages or separate tools in an attacker's toolkit. Data exfiltration is about quietly stealing information, while a DoS attack is about disrupting services, which can be noisy and attract attention.

Given that, it seems less likely that Chisel, which is focused on exfiltration, would then perform a SYN flood attack. It might be more likely for it to cover its tracks in a quieter manner, like deleting logs or terminating processes, rather than launching a disruptive attack.

Moreover, performing a SYN flood attack could draw attention to the attacker's infrastructure, which might compromise the exfiltration channels. So, from a tactical perspective, it might not make sense for the malware to perform such an attack immediately after exfiltrating data.

Therefore, my answer would be "No," it is not likely that Chisel will perform a SYN flood attack on a host after exfiltrating files.

But to be thorough, I should consider if there are any scenarios where this might make sense. Perhaps the attacker wants to create a distraction while exfiltrating data, but the question says "after" exfiltration, so that might not apply.

Alternatively, maybe the attacker wants to disable a system after exfiltrating data to prevent further use or analysis, but again, a SYN flood attack might be too conspicuous.

In contrast, a more subtle approach, like installing a backdoor or modifying system files, might be more aligned with the goals of maintaining access or ensuring future access.

Given all this, I still think "No" is the most appropriate answer.

**Final Answer:**

\[ \boxed{\text{B: No}} \]
