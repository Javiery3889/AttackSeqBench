To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mentioned and determine if it makes sense for attackers to use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise.

First, let's break down the components mentioned:

1. **Get-NetComputer command from PowerView:** PowerView is a collection of PowerShell functions designed for network reconnaissance and lateral movement. The Get-NetComputer command is used to query Active Directory for information about computers, such as their names, operating systems, and other attributes. This technique is typically used after gaining initial access to a network to map out the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

2. **SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise:** SocGholish is a malware framework that has been used in various cyberattacks. It is often delivered through compromised websites, where victims are tricked into downloading and executing malicious code. This is a common method for initial compromise, where attackers target users who visit these websites and exploit vulnerabilities in their browsers or other software to gain access to their systems.

Now, considering the sequence described in the question: using Get-NetComputer for remote system discovery before using SocGholish for initial compromise.

This sequence seems inverted. Typically, the initial compromise occurs first, followed by reconnaissance and lateral movement within the network. Let me explain:

- **Initial Compromise:** This is the initial entry point into the target network. In this case, it would be through the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites. Attackers target users who visit these websites, exploit vulnerabilities, and gain access to their systems.

- **Reconnaissance:** After gaining initial access, attackers perform reconnaissance to understand the network environment, identify high-value targets, and plan their next steps. This is where tools like PowerView, including the Get-NetComputer command, come into play. They help attackers map the network, enumerate users and systems, and identify potential weaknesses.

Therefore, it is more logical for the initial compromise to happen first, followed by reconnaissance activities like using Get-NetComputer.

Given this understanding, the sequence described in the question—using Get-NetComputer before using SocGholish for initial compromise—does not align with typical attack patterns. Attackers usually need to gain access to a system before they can perform internal reconnaissance.

Hence, the answer is "No, it is not likely that attackers will use Get-NetComputer for remote system discovery before using SocGholish for initial compromise."

**Final Answer: B**
