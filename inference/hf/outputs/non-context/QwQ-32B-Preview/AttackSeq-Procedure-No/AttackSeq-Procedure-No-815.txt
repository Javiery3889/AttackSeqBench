To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the specified action during the exfiltration phase is likely, given the earlier activities.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Communication with C2 servers using AES key encrypted with RSA:**
   - This indicates that WinDealer uses a combination of symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption for secure communication with its command and control (C2) servers.
   - AES is efficient for encrypting large amounts of data, while RSA is used to securely exchange the AES key.

2. **Command and Control (C2) activities:**
   - This suggests that WinDealer has already established a connection with the C2 server and is receiving commands or sending data back.

3. **Exfiltration phase:**
   - This is the stage where stolen data is being prepared to be sent out of the compromised system to the attacker's control.

4. **Processing and encrypting stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory:**
   - The question is whether WinDealer will create encrypted files with the extension ".a" in the temporary directory during this exfiltration phase.

Now, let's consider the likelihood of this action based on the given TTPs.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- **Encryption practices:**
  - WinDealer already uses AES and RSA for C2 communication. It's plausible that similar encryption methods are used for exfiltrating data to ensure confidentiality.

- **File handling:**
  - Storing data in the %TEMP% directory is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection, as this directory is often overlooked by users and some security software.

- **File extension ".a":**
  - The use of ".a" as a file extension is unusual for standard file types. It might be an attempt to make the files less conspicuous or to bypass certain file extension-based filters.

- **Sequence of actions:**
  - After communicating with C2 servers and receiving instructions, it's logical that WinDealer would proceed to collect and prepare data for exfiltration.

- **Consistency in TTPs:**
  - If WinDealer has already demonstrated the use of encryption for C2 communication, it's reasonable to assume that it would also encrypt data during exfiltration to prevent interception or analysis.

Given these points, it seems likely that WinDealer would process and encrypt stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase. This aligns with common malware behaviors aimed at stealth and data protection.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
