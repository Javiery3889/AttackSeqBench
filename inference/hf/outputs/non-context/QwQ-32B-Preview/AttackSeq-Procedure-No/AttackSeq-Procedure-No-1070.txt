So I've got this question here about some cyber attack tactics, and I need to figure out the most plausible sequence of actions based on the given scenario. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Equation Editor exploits are used to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. I know that Equation Editor is a component in Microsoft Office that allows users to insert equations into documents. It's been vulnerable to exploits in the past, which attackers can use to run malicious code on a victim's machine.

So, the attack starts with exploiting Equation Editor to run an installer package that contains malicious payloads. That makes sense as an initial infection vector.

Next, the question asks whether, after this initial step, the attackers—referred to as Tropic Trooper, which I believe is a threat actor group—are likely to drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activities before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

Okay, so let's understand what RegAsm.exe and dllhost.exe are. RegAsm.exe is a tool provided by Microsoft that registers .NET assemblies for use in COM interop. It's a legitimate Windows tool. Dllhost.exe is a process that hosts in-proc servers, which are components that run within the address space of the calling process.

Now, the idea here seems to be that the attackers would use RegAsm.exe to register some malicious DLL, and then inject that DLL into dllhost.exe to maintain persistence or perform further malicious activities.

But, I need to think about whether this sequence makes sense and is plausible.

First, why would they drop RegAsm.exe onto the system? RegAsm.exe is already present on most Windows systems as it's part of the .NET Framework. So, unless the system doesn't have it, there might not be a need to drop it separately.

Wait, but maybe they're dropping a specific version of RegAsm.exe that they trust or that has certain properties they need. That could be a possibility.

Then, using RegAsm.exe to register a malicious DLL makes sense because RegAsm.exe can be used to register .NET assemblies for COM interop, which could allow the DLL to be called by other components.

After that, injecting the malicious DLL into dllhost.exe could be a way to hide their activities within a legitimate process, making it harder for security software to detect the malicious activity.

So, overall, this sequence seems plausible.

But, the question is, is this likely to be the sequence that Tropic Trooper would follow?

I need to consider whether this sequence aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Tropic Trooper.

Unfortunately, I don't have specific knowledge about Tropic Trooper's TTPs. I've heard of various APT groups and their methods, but Tropic Trooper isn't one I'm familiar with. It's possible that it's a less-known group or perhaps a nickname for a specific campaign.

Given that, I might need to rely more on general knowledge of APT tactics and see if this sequence fits within common practices.

In general, APT groups often use living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) like RegAsm.exe to perform actions on a system because these binaries are already present and trusted by the operating system, reducing the chances of detection.

Dropping additional tools or specific versions of tools could also be a practice, but as I mentioned earlier, RegAsm.exe is typically already present on Windows systems.

Injecting DLLs into legitimate processes like dllhost.exe is a common technique for maintaining persistence and hiding malicious activities.

So, based on general APT tactics, this sequence seems plausible.

However, the question is whether it's likely for Tropic Trooper specifically to follow this sequence.

Without specific knowledge about Tropic Trooper's TTPs, I have to make an assumption based on common practices.

Given that, I would倾向于认为这个序列是可能的，因此答案是A: 是。

但是，为了更确信，我可能需要查找更多关于Tropic Trooper的信息，看看是否有任何报告或分析描述了他们的具体战术。

假设我有时间进行一些快速研究，我可能会搜索“Tropic Trooper APT TTPs”或类似的关键词，看看是否能找到相关的网络安全报告。

不过，由于时间限制，我可能无法进行深入的研究。

因此，基于一般的APT行为和所描述的序列，我倾向于选择A: 是。

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
