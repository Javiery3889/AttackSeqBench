To answer this question, I need to consider the behavior of malware actors, specifically whether it's common for them to perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information.

First, I should understand why an attacker would want to detect virtualized environments. Virtual machines (VMs) are often used by security researchers and analysts to study malware behavior in a controlled environment. If malware can detect that it's running in a VM, it might alter its behavior to avoid analysis, such as by not executing certain malicious activities or by terminating itself.

Common methods for detecting virtualized environments include checking for specific strings in system information, such as "Virtual", "vmware", or "VirtualBox", as mentioned in the question. These strings might appear in system properties, registry entries, or other system data that the malware can access.

On the other hand, gathering victim system information like username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and running processes is a standard activity for malware. This information helps the attacker understand the target environment, plan further attacks, or exfiltrate data.

Now, considering the sequence of actions described in the question: performing system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information. Is this a likely sequence?

From a malware perspective, it makes sense to first check if the environment is virtualized. If it is, the malware might decide not to proceed with its usual activities to avoid being analyzed. Therefore, performing these checks before gathering system information is a logical step.

Moreover, many malware samples include anti-analysis techniques, and VM detection is a common anti-analysis method. So, it's plausible that BlueBravo, whoever or whatever that is in this context, would perform such checks.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes", it is likely that BlueBravo will perform system checks to detect virtualized environments before gathering victim system information.

**Final Answer: A**
