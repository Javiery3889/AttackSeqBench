So I've got this question here about Yellow Garuda and their use of a Telegram 'grabber' tool. The question is asking whether, after collecting various data from victims' Telegram accounts, it's likely that these data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand who Yellow Garuda is and what their modus operandi might be. Yellow Garuda is a threat actor group that has been associated with cyber espionage activities, particularly in the context of Southeast Asia. They are known for using various tools and techniques to gather intelligence and sensitive information from their targets.

The Telegram 'grabber' tool mentioned in the question suggests that they are targeting Telegram users to collect messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. Telegram is a popular messaging app known for its security features, including end-to-end encryption. Therefore, compromising Telegram accounts could provide significant intelligence value to the threat actors.

Now, regarding the exfiltration of this data, the question is whether it's likely that the data are divided into fixed-size chunks to evade detection. To answer this, I need to consider the following factors:

1. **Detection Evasion Techniques**: Threat actors often employ various techniques to avoid detection by security systems. One such technique is to split data into smaller, less conspicuous chunks that are less likely to trigger alarms in network monitoring tools.

2. **Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Many organizations use IDS to monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity. Large data transfers or unusual patterns can raise red flags. By dividing data into smaller, more manageable chunks, attackers can blend in with normal traffic patterns.

3. **Data Exfiltration Methods**: There are different methods for exfiltrating data, including using command and control (C2) servers, file transfer protocols, or even social media platforms. The choice of method might influence whether chunking the data is necessary or beneficial.

4. **Efficiency and Reliability**: Dividing data into fixed-size chunks can also have practical benefits, such as ensuring that data is transmitted reliably, especially over unreliable networks. It can also make it easier to resume interrupted transfers.

5. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: If data is exfiltrated in large, uncompressed files, it might be easier for security analysts to identify and track. Smaller chunks might be harder to piece together and attribute to a specific exfiltration event.

Considering these factors, it seems plausible that Yellow Garuda, or any sophisticated threat actor, would employ techniques to evade detection during data exfiltration. Dividing data into fixed-size chunks is a common tactic used by malware and attackers to avoid triggering alerts based on large data transfers.

However, it's also important to consider that modern security systems can detect patterns of small, frequent data transfers that may indicate exfiltration activities. Therefore, while chunking data can help evade simple threshold-based detection, more advanced systems might still identify such activities.

Additionally, the nature of the data being exfiltrated could influence the approach. If the data are sensitive and the threat actors are particularly cautious, they might go to greater lengths to obfuscate their exfiltration methods, possibly including not only chunking but also encryption and using covert channels.

Given that the question is about whether it's "likely" that Yellow Garuda divides the data into fixed-size chunks to evade detection, and considering the general practices of threat actors in employing evasion techniques, I would lean towards answering "Yes."

But to make a more informed decision, I should look for any specific information about Yellow Garuda's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to data exfiltration. Unfortunately, without access to the latest threat intelligence reports, I have to rely on general knowledge about cyber espionage groups.

In summary, based on common practices in the cyber threat landscape, it is likely that Yellow Garuda divides the collected data into fixed-size chunks for exfiltration to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A**
