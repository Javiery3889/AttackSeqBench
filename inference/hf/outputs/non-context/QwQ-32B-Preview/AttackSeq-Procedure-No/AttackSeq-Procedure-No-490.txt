To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the sequence makes sense in the context of a typical cyber attack, specifically focusing on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the sequence mentioned in the question:

1. **Stealing application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.**

2. **Collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.**

I need to evaluate whether this sequence is plausible in the context of an attack attributed to "FamousSparrow," assuming FamousSparrow is an adversary group known for certain TTPs. However, since specific information about FamousSparrow isn't provided, I'll consider general adversary behavior.

### Step 1: Initial Access - Phishing Emails with Malicious Links

Phishing emails containing malicious links are a common initial access vector used by many adversaries. These links often lead to pages that either exploit browser vulnerabilities or trick users into downloading malware. The goal is to gain an initial foothold on the target's system.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this corresponds to the "Initial Access" phase, specifically techniques like:

- **Phishing (T1566):** Using social engineering via email to trick users into performing actions that result in compromise.

- **Drive-by Compromise (T1195):** Compromising a victim's machine by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in software when the user visits a malicious or compromised website.

### Step 2: Discovery - Collecting System Information and Probing Files

Once the adversary has gained initial access, the next phase is usually "Discovery," where they gather information about the compromised system and the network to which it's connected. This helps them understand the environment, identify high-value targets, and plan further steps.

Techniques under the Discovery phase include:

- **System Owner/User Discovery (T1033):** Gathering information about the logged-in user and local users.

- **System Information Discovery (T1082):** Gathering information about the system, such as OS version, installed software, etc.

- **File and Directory Discovery (T1083):** Enumerating files and directories to understand the structure and identify sensitive or useful information.

### Sequence Analysis

The sequence described in the question is:

1. Steal application access tokens via phishing emails.

2. Collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase.

This sequence makes sense because:

- **Initial Access:** Phishing emails are used to deliver the initial payload, likely a malware that can steal application access tokens.

- **Execution:** The malware is executed on the victim's system, potentially allowing the adversary to steal access tokens.

- **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the access tokens obtained, the adversary might gain persistent access or escalate privileges.

- **Discovery:** With a foothold established, the adversary proceeds to discover more about the system and network.

However, there's a slight overlap or potential confusion in the sequence:

- **Stealing application access tokens** could be part of the initial access or credential access phases.

- **Collecting system information and probing files** is clearly part of the Discovery phase.

In many attack scenarios, after gaining initial access, adversaries perform discovery activities to map the environment before moving laterally or escalating privileges. Stealing access tokens could be part of this discovery process or a separate step for maintaining access.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices

**A: Yes**

This answer acknowledges that the sequence is plausible. Given that phishing is a common initial access vector and discovery is a standard subsequent step, this seems reasonable.

**B: No**

This answer suggests that the sequence is not likely, implying that either the initial access method or the discovery activities don't align with typical adversary behavior.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the sequence described is consistent with typical adversary behavior as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Therefore, it is likely that FamousSparrow, or any adversary group, would follow such a sequence in their attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
