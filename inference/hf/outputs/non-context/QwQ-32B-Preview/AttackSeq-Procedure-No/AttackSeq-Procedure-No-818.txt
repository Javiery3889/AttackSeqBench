To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the threat actor group WinDealer and determine if it's plausible that they would use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for command and control (C2) communication before stealing information from social networking service (SNS) applications and encrypting that data using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

First, I need to understand the typical behavior of WinDealer. WinDealer is a threat actor group known for targeting organizations in various sectors, including government, military, and think tanks. Their primary objective is to steal sensitive information, often related to political and military affairs. They have been observed using a variety of malware and techniques to achieve their goals.

Next, I need to consider the use of FTP for C2 communication. FTP is an older protocol that is not typically used for C2 due to its lack of encryption and the ease with which it can be monitored and intercepted. Most modern malware uses more sophisticated and stealthy methods for C2 communication, such as DNS, HTTP/S, or even peer-to-peer networks. Using FTP for C2 would be risky for the threat actors, as it could make their communications easier to detect and disrupt.

Then, I need to think about the theft of information from SNS applications. Social networking services often contain a wealth of personal and organizational data that could be of interest to threat actors. Stealing this information would require the malware to have access to the victim's system and be able to extract data from installed SNS applications or browsers.

Finally, encrypting the stolen data using AES makes sense from a threat actor's perspective, as it helps to protect the stolen information during exfiltration and ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the decryption key.

Given this context, the sequence described in the question seems unlikely for several reasons:

1. **Use of FTP for C2:** As mentioned earlier, FTP is not a secure protocol for C2 communication. Threat actors generally prefer more stealthy and secure methods to avoid detection and ensure the integrity of their communications.

2. **Sequence of Actions:** Typically, in a cyber attack, C2 communication happens after initial access and often throughout the entire attack lifecycle. However, the sequence suggested in the question places FTP C2 before the data theft and encryption steps. This seems out of order because, in most attack scenarios, C2 communication is used to receive commands and exfiltrate data, not necessarily before specific data theft activities.

3. **Encryption of Stolen Data:** While encrypting stolen data is a common practice among threat actors, the use of AES is standard. However, the specific sequence of using FTP for C2 before stealing and encrypting SNS data seems inefficient and risky.

Considering these points, it is unlikely that WinDealer would use FTP for C2 communication before stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting it with AES. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
