So I've got this question here from FireEye Research Labs about a zero-day exploit in Internet Explorer. The question is asking whether, after the zero-day is identified, it executes some native Windows functions like GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before bypassing ASLR and DEP protections and then downloads the next stage payload.

The answer choices are simply A: Yes or B: No. Okay, so I need to decide between these two.

First, I need to understand what a zero-day exploit is. A zero-day exploit is a vulnerability that is exploited before the developer or vendor is aware of it or has released a patch for it. So, in this case, it's a vulnerability in Internet Explorer that FireEye has identified.

Now, the question is about the sequence of actions that this exploit takes once it's triggered. It mentions specific Windows functions: GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo. These are standard Windows API functions. GetFileAttributesW is used to retrieve attributes of a file, and GetSystemInfo is used to get information about the current system, like the amount of physical memory, page size, and so on.

ASLR stands for Address Space Layout Randomization, which is a security mechanism that randomly arranges the positions of key data areas, like the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap, and libraries, in the system's memory space. This makes it harder for an attacker to predict where their code will be in memory.

DEP stands for Data Execution Prevention, which is a security feature that marks certain areas of memory as non-executable, meaning that code cannot be run from those areas. This is to prevent an attacker from injecting and executing malicious code in those regions.

So, the exploit is supposed to execute these native Windows functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP and then downloading the next stage payload.

I need to think about whether this sequence makes sense.

First, why would the exploit execute GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo? Well, these functions could be used for various purposes in the context of an exploit. For example, GetFileAttributesW could be used to check if certain files exist or to gather information about the file system, which might be useful for the exploit to determine the environment it's running in.

GetSystemInfo could provide information about the system, like the amount of memory, which could be used to allocate buffers or to adjust the exploit's behavior based on the system's capabilities.

So, it's plausible that the exploit would use these functions as part of its operation.

Next, bypassing ASLR and DEP. These are security measures that make it harder for exploits to reliably execute code. To bypass ASLR, an exploit might need to leak memory addresses to find the locations of certain libraries or code sections. To bypass DEP, it might use techniques like Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) or find executable memory regions.

The exploit would need to perform these bypasses in order to execute its own code successfully.

Finally, downloading the next stage payload. This is a common practice in exploits where the initial exploit code is small and only responsible for gaining an initial foothold and then fetching more sophisticated malware to carry out further actions.

So, the sequence makes sense: execute some native functions to gather information, bypass security protections, and then download and execute additional payload.

Now, looking back at the question, it's asking whether this sequence occurs after the zero-day exploit is identified by FireEye Research Labs.

I think there might be a slight confusion here. The identification by FireEye would come after the exploit is in the wild, but the sequence of actions described would be part of how the exploit works when it's executed on a victim's machine.

So, perhaps the question is asking whether, once FireEye has identified the exploit, they have determined that this sequence of actions takes place during the exploit's execution.

Given that FireEye is a cybersecurity firm that researches and analyzes threats, it's likely that they would disassemble and analyze the exploit to understand its behavior, including the sequence of API calls it makes and the techniques it uses to bypass security measures.

Therefore, if FireEye has identified the zero-day exploit, they would have analyzed it and documented its behavior, including whether it executes these specific functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP and downloading the next stage payload.

Given that, the answer should be "Yes," assuming that FireEye's analysis has confirmed this sequence.

But to be thorough, I should consider if there's any reason to believe otherwise.

Is it possible that the exploit doesn't use these specific functions? Well, maybe, but the question specifies these functions, so if FireEye has identified them in their analysis, then it's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the exploit uses different functions to achieve the same goals.

But based on the information provided, the answer should be "Yes," assuming that FireEye's analysis confirms this sequence.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A}} \]
