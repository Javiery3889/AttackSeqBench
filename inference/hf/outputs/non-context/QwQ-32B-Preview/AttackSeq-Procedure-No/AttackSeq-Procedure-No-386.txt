To answer this question, I need to analyze the given information and evaluate the likelihood based on the actions described.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.**

   - Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for credential dumping, which allows attackers to extract plaintext credentials from memory. Obtaining domain administrator credentials gives APT15 high-level access to the network.

2. **Stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.**

   - By stealing a VPN certificate, APT15 can gain remote access to the network without needing to compromise additional systems or install backdoors.

Now, the question is asking whether it's likely that APT15 used valid account information, such as VPN credentials, to remotely access victim networks instead of deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

Let's consider the implications:

- **Using valid credentials:** This approach leverages legitimate access methods, which can be stealthier because it doesn't involve installing potentially detectable malware. It also avoids raising alarms since the activity appears to be authorized.

- **Deploying backdoors:** Backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS are tools that provide persistent access to the network. While effective, they can be detected by security measures and may raise suspicions if found.

Given that APT15 already has domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate, they have legitimate means to access the network remotely. Using these valid credentials would be more discreet and lower the risk of detection compared to deploying backdoors.

Moreover, deploying backdoors carries additional risks, such as:

- **Detection:** Backdoors can be identified by antivirus software or network monitoring tools.

- **Noise:** Installing and maintaining backdoors may generate network traffic that could be flagged as anomalous.

- **Cleanup:** If discovered, backdoors need to be removed or replaced, adding complexity to the operation.

In contrast, using valid credentials minimizes these risks. The attackers can blend in with normal user activity, making their actions harder to distinguish from legitimate traffic.

Therefore, it is more plausible that APT15 would prefer using the stolen VPN credentials and domain administrator credentials for remote access rather than deploying backdoors.

**Final Answer: A**
