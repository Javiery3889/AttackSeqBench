To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the scenario is plausible, given what I know about malware operations, particularly those involving Ursnif and GandCrab.

First, let's break down the attack sequence as described:

1. **Initial Access:** The attack begins with phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This is a common method for initial access, as phishing emails can trick users into opening attachments that contain malware.

2. **COM Object Execution:** After gaining initial access, the malicious document is supposed to execute a COM object that gathers system information.

3. **Payload Download:** Finally, the COM object downloads payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Now, let's examine each part of this sequence.

**Initial Access via Phishing Emails:**

This is a standard tactic used by many malware campaigns. Phishing emails often contain attachments like Word documents that are rigged to execute malicious code when opened. This is consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1193: Spearphishing Attachment.

**COM Object Execution:**

COM (Component Object Model) is a platform for building reusable, component-based applications. Malware can abuse COM objects to execute code or perform various actions on a system. Using COM objects for executing queries to gather system information is plausible, as they can interact with system components and services.

In the context of malware, using COM objects might be part of the execution or persistence tactics. For example, malware might use COM to execute scripts, interact with the registry, or communicate with other system components.

**Payload Download:**

After gathering system information, the malware proceeds to download additional payloads. This is a common behavior in malware, especially in multi-stage attacks where the initial payload is used to assess the target system and download more sophisticated malware based on the system's characteristics.

Ursnif and GandCrab are both types of malware, with Ursnif being a banking Trojan and GandCrab being a ransomware variant. It's unusual for both to be downloaded in the same attack, as they serve different purposes. However, it's not impossible; an attacker might use Ursnif to steal banking information and then deploy GandCrab for additional monetization through ransom demands.

**Evaluating the Plausibility:**

Given the sequence:

- Initial access through phishing emails with a malicious Word document.

- Execution of a COM object to gather system information.

- Downloading of Ursnif and GandCrab payloads.

This sequence seems plausible for several reasons:

1. **Initial Access Method:** Phishing with malicious attachments is a widely used and effective method for initial access.

2. **Use of COM Objects:** Malware often uses system components like COM objects to perform actions without raising suspicion.

3. **Multi-Stage Attack:** Downloading additional payloads based on system information is a common tactic to maximize the effectiveness of the attack.

However, the combination of Ursnif and GandCrab in the same attack is somewhat unusual, as they serve different purposes. Typically, an attacker would choose one type of malware depending on their goalâ€”either information theft or ransomware for monetary gain.

Despite this, it's not impossible for an attacker to use both. They might use Ursnif to steal sensitive information first and then deploy GandCrab to encrypt files and demand a ransom.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the sequence of events described in the question is plausible. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
