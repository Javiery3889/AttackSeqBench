To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether they form a plausible sequence for the malware TDrop2.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.

2. **Discovery Activities:** Gathering system information and network views.

3. **Execution Technique:** Process hollowing to evade detection.

The question is asking whether it's likely that TDrop2 would follow this sequence of actions after gaining initial access.

### Step 1: Understanding TDrop2

TDrop2 is a variant of the TDrop malware, which is known for its use in cyber espionage campaigns. It's important to understand the typical behavior of TDrop2 to assess the plausibility of the described sequence.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence of TTPs

#### Initial Access: Spear-Phishing with Trojanized Executables

Spear-phishing is a common initial access vector, especially in targeted attacks. Using trojanized installation executables is a standard technique to entice users to run malicious code under the guise of legitimate software.

#### Discovery Activities: Gathering System Information and Network Views

After gaining access, adversaries often perform discovery activities to understand the target environment. This includes gathering system information (e.g., OS version, installed software, running processes) and network views (e.g., mapping the network topology, identifying other devices and systems).

#### Execution Technique: Process Hollowing

Process hollowing is a technique used to evade detection by antivirus software and other security measures. It involves creating a new process in a suspended state and then modifying its memory to execute malicious code, while the process appears to be a legitimate executable.

### Step 3: Evaluating Plausibility

Is it likely that TDrop2 would engage in discovery activities before using process hollowing for execution?

1. **Sequence of Actions:**

   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing with trojanized executables.

   - **Discovery:** Gather system and network information.

   - **Execution:** Use process hollowing to run malicious code.

2. **Plausibility:**

   - **Initial Access:** Plausible; spear-phishing is a common method.

   - **Discovery:** Adversaries typically perform discovery to understand the environment and plan further actions.

   - **Execution:** Process hollowing is a known technique for evasion, and it's plausible that TDrop2 would use it to execute its payload.

3. **Order of Operations:**

   - The sequence makes sense: gain access, understand the environment, and then execute the payload using evasion techniques.

4. **Specific to TDrop2:**

   - While I don't have specific details about TDrop2's behavior, given that it's a malware variant used in espionage, it's likely to employ such tactics.

### Step 4: Considering Alternatives

- **Alternative Sequence:** Executing process hollowing immediately after initial access without performing discovery.

  - This could be possible, but performing discovery helps the adversary to tailor their actions to the specific environment, increasing the effectiveness of the attack.

- **Omitting Discovery:**

  - Skipping discovery might lead to less efficient lateral movement and data exfiltration.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Given the typical behavior of malware in cyber espionage campaigns and the logical sequence of actions described, it is plausible that TDrop2 would engage in discovery activities before using process hollowing for execution.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
