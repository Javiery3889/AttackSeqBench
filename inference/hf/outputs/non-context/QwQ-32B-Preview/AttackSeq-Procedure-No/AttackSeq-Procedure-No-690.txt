To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the sequence of events described in the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Attackers gain initial access to hosts by identifying internal systems and remote control software using tools like Advanced IP Scanner and PushVNC package.

2. **Defense Evasion:** The question asks whether it's likely that attackers will use Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) injection to execute commands received from the Command and Control (C2) server as part of their defense evasion tactics.

Now, let's look at each part in more detail.

**Initial Access:**

- **Advanced IP Scanner:** This is a network scanner tool that can discover devices on a network by scanning IP addresses. It's a legitimate tool but can be misused by attackers to identify potential targets.

- **PushVNC Package:** VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a graphical desktop sharing system that allows remote control of another computer. PushVNC might be a specific implementation or variant used by attackers to gain remote access to systems.

So, the attackers are using network scanning and remote control software to gain initial access to systems within a network.

**Defense Evasion:**

- **Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) Injection:** APC is a mechanism in Windows operating systems used for asynchronous procedure calls. Attackers can exploit this mechanism to inject code into the address space of another process, allowing them to execute code in the context of that process.

- **Executing Commands from C2:** Once initial access is gained, attackers typically need to maintain persistence and execute various commands received from their C2 server. Defense evasion techniques are used to hide their activities from security defenses.

Now, is it likely that attackers will use APC injection for this purpose?

Let's consider the following points:

1. **Technique Relevance:** APC injection is a technique used for process injection, which is a method of executing code within the address space of another process. This can help attackers evade detection because the execution is occurring within a legitimate process.

2. **MITRE ATT&CK Framework:** According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, process injection techniques like APC injection are indeed used for defense evasion. Specifically, under the "Defense Evasion" tactic, there are multiple sub-techniques related to process injection.

3. **Likelihood of Use:** While APC injection is a viable technique, it's just one of many process injection methods available to attackers. Other techniques include DLL injection, atom bombing, process hollowing, etc. The choice of technique may depend on various factors such as the target environment, available privileges, and the specific goals of the attack.

4. **Context of the Attack:** Given that the attackers have already gained initial access using network scanning and remote control software, it's plausible that they would employ advanced techniques like APC injection to maintain persistence and execute commands from their C2 server while evading detection.

However, it's essential to note that not all attackers are equally sophisticated, and the use of such techniques may vary based on the attacker's capabilities and the specific circumstances of the attack.

Considering the above points, it seems reasonable to conclude that using APC injection for defense evasion is a possible tactic for attackers who have gained initial access through the methods described.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
