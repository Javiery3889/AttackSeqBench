So I've got this question here about Microsoft Outlook MAPI and how it relates to collecting email accounts from contacts, and then whether those collected email accounts are automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what MAPI is. MAPI stands for Messaging Application Programming Interface. It's a part of Microsoft's messaging architecture that allows developers to create applications that can interact with messaging systems, like Microsoft Outlook. So, if someone is accessing Outlook via MAPI, they're essentially interacting with the Outlook application to retrieve or manipulate data, such as emails, contacts, etc.

Now, the question mentions that after accessing Outlook MAPI, email accounts are collected from contacts. So, assuming that someone has access to Outlook via MAPI, they can retrieve contact information, which includes email addresses.

The next part is about whether these collected email accounts are automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server.

So, the question is asking whether, as part of this process, the email addresses collected from Outlook contacts are automatically sent over FTP to some remote server.

To answer this, I need to consider how MAPI works and whether it inherently includes functionality to exfiltrate data over FTP.

MAPI is primarily designed for interacting with Outlook and managing messaging data. It doesn't have built-in functionality to transfer files over FTP. FTP is a separate protocol that would require additional implementation to use in conjunction with MAPI.

Therefore, unless there is specific code or software that is using MAPI to collect email addresses and then using FTP to upload those email addresses to a remote server, it wouldn't happen automatically.

In other words, MAPI alone doesn't automatically exfiltrate data over FTP. Someone would need to write a script or develop a program that uses MAPI to collect the email addresses and then uses FTP to send that data to a remote server.

So, in the context of this question, it's unlikely that the collection of email accounts from Outlook contacts via MAPI would automatically result in those email accounts being exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers, unless there is specific malicious software or script that is designed to do so.

Given that, I would say the answer is "No," because there's no inherent connection between MAPI and FTP that would cause automatic exfiltration.

But, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any scenarios where this might happen automatically.

Perhaps, if there is a malware or a tool that uses MAPI to collect email addresses and then uses FTP to upload them to a command and control server, then in that case, it could be considered "automatic."

However, the question seems to be asking about the general behavior of MAPI, not about specific malicious tools that might use MAPI in conjunction with FTP.

Therefore, in the general case, accessing Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts does not automatically exfiltrate those email accounts over FTP to remote servers.

Hence, the correct answer should be "No."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{B: No}} \]
