To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the WINDSHIFT Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group and determine if the described activities align with their known modus operandi.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Actions:**
   - Sending benign daily emails duplicating local media content to build a relationship with the target.
   - Tracking interactions via domains like Wasmyemailread[.]com and ifread[.]com.

2. **Subsequent Actions:**
   - Using fake social media personas to gather identifiable information.
   - Employing social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents as part of reconnaissance.

I need to assess whether these subsequent actions are likely to be part of WINDSHIFT APT's strategy following the initial steps.

**Step 1: Understanding WINDSHIFT APT**

WINDSHIFT is an APT group known for its cyber espionage activities, particularly targeting entities in the Middle East. Their tactics often involve spear-phishing emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, aiming to gain a foothold in the target's environment.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Initial Actions**

- **Benign Emails Duplicating Local Media Content:** This technique is designed to establish trust with the target by appearing as a reliable source of local news and information.
- **Tracking Interactions via Specific Domains:** Using domains like Wasmyemailread[.]com and ifread[.]com suggests that the attackers are monitoring whether their emails are being read, which helps them gauge the target's engagement and adjust their approach accordingly.

These initial steps are consistent with the reconnaissance phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the "Reconnaissance" and "Initial Access" tactics.

**Step 3: Evaluating the Subsequent Actions**

- **Fake Social Media Personas:** Creating and using fake profiles on social media platforms to gather identifiable information is a common tactic in social engineering. This can help attackers gather personal details, interests, and connections of the target, which can be used to craft more convincing phishing attempts.
- **Stealing Contact Lists, Emails, and SMS Contents:** Gaining access to a target's contact list, emails, and SMS can provide valuable intelligence for further reconnaissance and lateral movement within a network. This aligns with the "Collection" and "Exfiltration" phases in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Step 4: Correlating with Known APT Behavior**

APT groups often employ multi-stage approaches to maximize their chances of success. Starting with benign emails to build trust and then progressing to more invasive techniques like using social media to gather sensitive information is a plausible sequence.

Moreover, the use of social media for espionage activities is not uncommon among APT groups. For instance, groups like APT28 and APT33 have been known to leverage social media for intelligence gathering and phishing purposes.

**Step 5: Considering the Plausibility**

Given that WINDSHIFT APT is already engaged in phishing campaigns via email, expanding their efforts to social media platforms to gather more information and potentially gain access to additional data seems logical. Social media provides a rich source of personal and professional information that can be exploited for targeted attacks.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT would use fake social media personas to gather identifiable information and employ social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents as part of their reconnaissance activities following the initial email-based approach.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
