I have this question here about CosmicDuke, which seems to be a type of malware or a threat actor. The question is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, it mentions that CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected data to remote servers via FTP. So, it's already collecting some data and sending it out through File Transfer Protocol. Then, the question asks whether, after doing this, CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather more information. But there's a condition: this would be only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.

I need to decide if this sequence of actions makes sense for CosmicDuke based on what I know about such threats.

Let me start by understanding what each of these components means:

1. **Exfiltration via FTP**: This is a common method for malware to send stolen data to remote servers controlled by attackers. FTP is an older protocol, and using it might indicate that the malware is designed to operate in environments where newer protocols are restricted.

2. **Keylogger, Screenshotter, Clipboard Stealer**: These are tools used to capture sensitive information in real-time. A keylogger records keystrokes to capture passwords and other typed information. A screenshotter takes periodic screenshots of the user's screen to capture visual information. A clipboard stealer monitors the clipboard for sensitive data that users might copy.

3. **Searching removable drives**: This suggests that the malware also looks for data stored on external devices like USB drives.

4. **Skipping certain file types**: This implies that the malware is selective about the types of files it collects, possibly focusing on documents, spreadsheets, or other files that are likely to contain sensitive information.

Now, considering the sequence:

- Exfiltrate data via FTP

- Search removable drives and skip certain file types during collection

- Use keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information

The question is whether the last step (using the keylogger, etc.) is likely to happen only after the second step (searching removable drives and skipping file types).

I need to think about the typical behavior of malware like CosmicDuke. Generally, malware is designed to collect as much information as possible in various ways. Exfiltrating data via FTP is one method, but using additional tools like keyloggers can provide real-time information that might not be captured otherwise.

So, does it make sense for the malware to first exfiltrate data via FTP and then, after searching removable drives and being selective about file types, start using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer?

Hmm. Maybe the idea is that after initial data exfiltration, the malware assesses what data is available on removable drives and which file types are worth targeting, and then decides to employ more invasive techniques like keylogging to capture additional, potentially more sensitive information.

Alternatively, perhaps the malware uses these different collection methods concurrently or in a different order.

I need to consider the timeline and dependencies between these actions.

First, exfiltration via FTP suggests that there's already a channel for data export. Then, searching removable drives and skipping certain file types indicates that the malware is methodically collecting data from different sources on the compromised system.

After that, employing a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer suggests a shift towards real-time monitoring and collection of ongoing activities on the system.

Is there a logical reason why the malware would wait until after searching removable drives before enabling these real-time collection tools?

Perhaps the malware prioritizes exfiltrating existing data first and then sets up for ongoing data collection.

Alternatively, maybe the malware uses these tools in parallel.

But according to the question, it's "only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection" that it uses the keylogger, etc.

This seems like a specific sequence, and I need to judge whether this sequence is plausible for CosmicDuke.

Given that CosmicDuke is likely a sophisticated threat, it's possible that it employs a phased approach to data collection and exfiltration to avoid detection and to maximize the value of the data collected.

So, perhaps it first exfiltrates readily available data, then moves on to more targeted and invasive data collection methods.

But is this sequence necessary or efficient?

Exfiltrating data via FTP and then setting up for real-time data collection could be a valid strategy. However, often, malware will perform multiple collection methods simultaneously to maximize the chances of capturing sensitive information.

Moreover, using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer is more about real-time monitoring, while exfiltrating data via FTP is about sending already collected data out.

So, perhaps these actions aren't strictly sequential but rather happen concurrently.

Alternatively, maybe the malware is designed to first collect and exfiltrate data from persistent storage (like hard drives and removable media), and then set up for ongoing monitoring through real-time collection methods.

This could make sense from an operational security perspective, ensuring that both existing and future data are captured.

However, the question specifies that the real-time collection tools are used "only after" searching removable drives and skipping certain file types.

This seems like a specific sequence that might not be necessary or efficient for the malware's operations.

In practice, malware often performs multiple data collection activities simultaneously to maximize the amount of data collected.

Therefore, it might be unlikely for CosmicDuke to wait until after searching removable drives and skipping file types before enabling real-time collection tools.

Alternatively, perhaps the malware is designed to prioritize exfiltrating existing data first and then set up for ongoing monitoring once the initial data exfiltration is complete.

This could be a way to manage bandwidth usage or to ensure that existing data is exfiltrated before setting up for future data collection.

But again, this seems like an unusual sequence, as real-time monitoring could capture data that is being created or accessed in real-time, which might not be captured through initial exfiltration.

Moreover, searching removable drives and being selective about file types during collection might be part of the initial data collection phase, but enabling real-time monitoring tools wouldn't necessarily depend on the completion of that phase.

In fact, enabling real-time monitoring as soon as possible could be beneficial for capturing user activities that occur after the initial infection.

Therefore, it seems less plausible that CosmicDuke would wait until after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types before enabling keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.

Hence, the answer is likely "No," it is not plausible that CosmicDuke would follow this specific sequence.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{B: No}} \]
