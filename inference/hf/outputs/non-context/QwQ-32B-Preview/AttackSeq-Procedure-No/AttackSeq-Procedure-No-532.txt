So I've got this question here about some cyber threat called the "Dropping Elephant backdoor." It says that this thing evades defenses by decoding some blobs into PowerShell scripts and then downloads additional malware. The question is whether it's likely to steal browser cookies from Google Chrome and Apple Safari on the victim's machine.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. There's an attack sequence here: decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts, which then download more malware. The backdoor in question is called "Dropping Elephant," and the question is about its likelihood to steal browser cookies specifically from Chrome and Safari.

I need to evaluate the answer choices, which are simply "Yes" or "No." So, my task is to determine whether, based on the information provided, it's plausible that this backdoor would steal browser cookies from these two specific browsers.

Let me break this down. The attack uses PowerShell, which is a powerful scripting language on Windows. It's commonly used by attackers because it's built into the system and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including downloading and executing malware.

The fact that it's decoding encoded blobs suggests that the attackers are trying to obfuscate their commands to avoid detection by security software. This is a common tactic in malware to evade signature-based detection.

Now, about the backdoor stealing browser cookies. Browser cookies can contain sensitive information, like session tokens, which can be used for session hijacking. So, it makes sense that malware might want to steal them.

But the question is specifically about Google Chrome and Apple Safari. Are there any reasons to think that this particular backdoor targets these browsers?

Well, Chrome and Safari are two of the most popular web browsers, so it makes sense that malware would target them to maximize the chance of stealing useful information. However, the question is whether it's "likely" given the information provided.

The information given is about the method of evasion and the download of additional malware via PowerShell. There's no direct mention of the backdoor's capabilities regarding stealing browser cookies.

But, considering that backdoors are typically designed to maintain access and exfiltrate data, it's plausible that stealing browser cookies could be one of their functions. Moreover, since Chrome and Safari are widely used, targeting them would make sense from an attacker's perspective.

However, the question asks specifically about the likelihood based on the given sequence of TTPs ( Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). The sequence is: evading defenses by decoding blobs into PowerShell scripts, which then download additional malware.

Is there a direct link between these actions and stealing browser cookies? Not necessarily. The sequence describes how the malware gets onto the system and becomes persistent, but it doesn't explicitly state that it steals cookies.

But, considering that dropping a backdoor likely implies that the attackers want to maintain access and gather information, it's reasonable to assume that stealing browser cookies could be one of the activities they engage in.

Moreover, the fact that it's called a "backdoor" suggests that it provides remote access to the system, which could be used for various malicious activities, including stealing cookies.

But, the question is specifically about whether it's likely to steal cookies from Chrome and Safari. Is there anything in the provided information that suggests it targets these specific browsers?

Not really. The information is generic and doesn't specify which browsers are targeted. However, since Chrome and Safari are two of the most widely used browsers, it's plausible that the backdoor is designed to steal cookies from them.

On the other hand, some backdoors might be more targeted and only go after specific browsers based on the attacker's goals. Without more information, it's hard to say for sure.

But, given that the question is about likelihood based on the provided sequence of TTPs, and considering that stealing browser cookies from popular browsers like Chrome and Safari is a common practice in malware, I think it's reasonable to conclude that yes, it's likely.

Therefore, I would choose answer A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
