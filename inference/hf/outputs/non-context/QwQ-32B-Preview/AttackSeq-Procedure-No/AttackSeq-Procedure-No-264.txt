To answer this question, we need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the proposed sequence is plausible based on known cyber threat actor behaviors, particularly focusing on the group Mustang Panda and their use of specific tools like LoJax and control-flow obfuscation.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Mustang Panda delivers a downloader with filenames linked to current events to open a decoy document.

2. **Next Steps:** The question asks whether, after gaining initial access, the group is likely to deploy a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.

We need to assess the plausibility of this sequence.

### Step 1: Understanding Mustang Panda and LoJax

Mustang Panda, also known as APT27 or Emissary Panda, is a Chinese state-sponsored threat group known for its cyber espionage activities. LoJax is a UEFI rootkit that was used by another group, FIN7, in their attacks. It's important to note that LoJax is not typically associated with Mustang Panda.

LoJax is a sophisticated rootkit that modifies the UEFI firmware of a system, allowing persistent access even after the operating system is reinstalled. This is a high-level persistence mechanism that is difficult to detect and remove.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence of TTPs

The proposed sequence is:

1. Deliver a downloader via a decoy document with filenames linked to current events.

2. Deploy LoJax UEFI rootkit.

3. Engage in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.

Let's evaluate each step:

#### Initial Access

- **Downloader with filenames linked to current events:** This is a common social engineering tactic where threat actors use timely and relevant subjects to entice targets to open attachments. This is plausible.

#### Persistence and Evasion

- **Deploying LoJax:** Given that LoJax is associated with FIN7 and not Mustang Panda, it's less likely that Mustang Panda would use LoJax. Threat groups typically have their own set of tools and techniques, and using a tool attributed to another group would be unusual unless there is evidence of tool sharing or borrowing.

- **Control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion:** Control-flow obfuscation is a technique used to make reverse engineering difficult by altering the program's control flow without changing its functionality. This is a valid defense evasion technique, but its placement after deploying a UEFI rootkit seems out of sequence.

### Step 3: Evaluating Plausibility

Given that LoJax is not typically associated with Mustang Panda, the likelihood of them deploying LoJax after initial access is low. Additionally, the sequence of deploying a UEFI rootkit followed by control-flow obfuscation seems inverted. Typically, persistence mechanisms are established early in the attack chain to ensure long-term access, while defense evasion techniques are employed throughout the attack to avoid detection.

A more plausible sequence for Mustang Panda would be:

1. Initial access via a decoy document with a downloader.

2. Establishing persistence using tools and techniques typical to Mustang Panda, such as registry modifications, scheduled tasks, or other less sophisticated persistence mechanisms.

3. Employing defense evasion techniques, including code obfuscation, to hide their activities and avoid detection.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
