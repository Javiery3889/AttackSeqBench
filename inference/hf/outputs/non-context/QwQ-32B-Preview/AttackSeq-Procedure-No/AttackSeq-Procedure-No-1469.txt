So I've got this question here about cyber threats and attack sequences. It's a bit technical, but I think I can wrap my head around it. Let's see.

The question is: "After reconnaissance activities such as gathering publicly available information on systems and conducting active discovery methods, is it likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution?"

And the answer choices are simply A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like there's a sequence of events in a cyber attack, and the question is about the timing of communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers in relation to the installation of malware on a network.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Reconnaissance Activities:**

   - Gathering publicly available information on systems.

   - Conducting active discovery methods.

This is the initial phase where attackers gather intelligence about their target. They look for vulnerabilities, open ports, software versions, and other details that can be exploited.

2. **Malicious Implants like BlackEnergy 3:**

BlackEnergy is a type of malware that has been used in various cyber attacks, particularly for targeted intrusions and data exfiltration. BlackEnergy 3 is a variant that gained notoriety for its use in attacks against Ukrainian organizations.

3. **Establish Communication with C2 Servers:**

After gaining access to a target network, attackers need to maintain control over the compromised systems. They do this by establishing communication with C2 servers, which act as the command centers for managing the malware.

4. **Installation through Employee-Enabled Macro Execution:**

This refers to the method of delivering the malware to the target network. In this case, it's through social engineering, likely by sending phishing emails that convince employees to enable macros in documents, which then execute the malware.

Now, the question is asking whether, after the reconnaissance phase, it's likely that such malware will establish communication with C2 servers only before being installed on the network via employee-enabled macro execution.

Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let's try to clarify the sequence of events.

- **Reconnaissance:** Attackers gather information about the target.

- **Delivery of Malware:** They send phishing emails with documents containing malicious macros.

- **Execution:** An employee enables macros, which executes the malware.

- **Communication with C2:** The malware then contacts the C2 server to receive further instructions.

So, based on this sequence, the communication with C2 servers happens after the malware is installed on the network, not before.

But the question is asking if the malware establishes communication with C2 servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

Wait, that seems backwards. Typically, the malware is installed first (when the macro is enabled), and then it communicates with the C2 server.

Let me check the wording again.

"Is it likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution?"

So, it's asking if the communication with C2 happens before the malware is installed via macro execution.

But according to my understanding, it's the other way around: the malware is installed first, and then it communicates with C2.

Therefore, the answer should be "No," because the communication with C2 typically occurs after the malware is installed, not before.

Wait, but maybe there are scenarios where communication happens before installation. Let's think about that.

In some advanced malware, there might be a preliminary communication to download a staging payload or to receive instructions before fully installing itself. But in the case of macro-based malware, usually, the macro executes the malware on the system, and then the malware reaches out to the C2 server.

Moreover, in the context of BlackEnergy 3, which is known for its use in targeted attacks, the typical sequence is to get the malware onto the system first and then establish communication.

Also, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the sequence generally follows:

- Initial Access (phishing with macros)

- Execution (enabling macros)

- Persistence (malware establishes itself)

- Command and Control (communication with C2)

- and so on.

So, according to this, C2 comes after the malware is installed.

Therefore, the statement in the question seems incorrect because it suggests that communication with C2 happens before installation, which isn't aligning with the typical attack sequence.

Hence, the answer should be B: No.

But let me consider if there are any circumstances where communication could occur before installation.

Perhaps, in some cases of reflective loading or other memory-based execution techniques, there might be an initial communication to fetch parts of the malware before full execution. However, in the context of macro-based attacks, it's more common for the macro to execute a payload that then communicates outward.

Additionally, enabling macros typically allows the execution of malicious code on the system, which is when the malware can begin its operations, including reaching out to C2 servers.

Therefore, it's unlikely that communication with C2 occurs before the malware is installed via macro execution.

So, the correct answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
