To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to APT28 and see if the described sequence aligns with known behaviors of this threat group.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing and Exploit Documents:**
   - APT28 is known for using spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain initial access to target networks.
   - These attachments often contain exploit documents, such as Microsoft Office documents with embedded exploits.

2. **Installation and Execution of VBA Script (vba_macro.exe):**
   - VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros are commonly used in malware to execute malicious code.
   - The mention of "vba_macro.exe" seems a bit unusual because typically, VBA macros are part of Office documents and are not executed as standalone .exe files. However, it's possible that the macro drops or executes a malicious executable.

3. **Dropping Malware like FONTCACHE.DAT:**
   - FONTCACHE.DAT is a known malware file associated with APT28.
   - It's used for maintaining persistence and communicating with command and control servers.

4. **Leveraging Tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE:**
   - These are all tools attributed to APT28.
   - CHOPSTICK is a backdoor used for remote access.
   - EVILTOSS is a dropper used to deliver other malware.
   - SOURFACE is a backdoor that provides remote access and control.

Now, let's evaluate the sequence:

- **Spear-phishing with exploit documents:** This is consistent with APT28's known initial access vectors.

- **Installing and executing a VBA script:** APT28 has used macros in documents to execute malicious code. While "vba_macro.exe" seems unusual, it's possible that the macro drops an executable.

- **Dropping FONTCACHE.DAT:** This is plausible, as FONTCACHE.DAT is part of their toolkit.

- **Using CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE:** These tools are part of APT28's arsenal and are used at various stages of their operations.

Given this information, the sequence described seems plausible for APT28's modus operandi.

However, I need to consider if this sequence is typical or if there are variations.

- APT28 is known for using a variety of initial access vectors and malware families.

- The specific sequence might vary depending on the target and the environment.

- But the overall pattern of using spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, dropping malware for persistence, and then using backdoors and droppers aligns with their known tactics.

Therefore, it is likely that APT28 would follow such a sequence in their operations.

Looking back at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
