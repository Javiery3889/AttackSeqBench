So I've got this question here about SparrowDoor and its relation to initial access through remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that cmd.exe commands were used to execute SparrowDoor for execution, and that there's communication with a C&C server via encrypted HTTPS for command and control. Then it asks if, given these facts, it's likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for initial access.

Okay, so we need to think about the sequence of events here. SparrowDoor is being executed after some commands are run in cmd.exe, and it's communicating back to a command and control server over HTTPS. The question is asking about the initial access vector—how the attack started in the first place.

Now, the answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No," so I need to decide whether it's likely that remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications were exploited for initial access, given the information provided.

Let's consider what initial access means. Initial access is the first step in the kill chain, where the attacker gains a foothold in the target network. This could be through various methods, such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, social engineering, etc.

In this case, the question mentions that SparrowDoor is being executed using cmd.exe commands and communicates back to a C&C server over HTTPS. But it doesn't specify how the attacker gained initial access to run those commands in the first place.

So, is it likely that the initial access was through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications?

Well, remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications are indeed a common initial access vector. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the target system, thereby gaining initial access.

However, the question doesn't provide any direct information about how the initial access was gained. It only describes the actions after initial access has been achieved—namely, executing SparrowDoor via cmd.exe and communicating with a C&C server over HTTPS.

Given that, I have to rely on general knowledge about attack patterns and the likelihood of certain initial access vectors being used.

Remote code execution vulnerabilities are certainly a popular method for initial access, especially in targeted attacks. Internet-facing applications, such as web servers, email servers, or other services exposed to the internet, are common targets because they provide a direct attack surface from the outside.

Moreover, the fact that the communication with the C&C server is over HTTPS suggests that the attackers are trying to blend in with normal traffic, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.

But, without more specific information about how the initial access was gained, I have to make an educated guess based on typical attack patterns.

Another consideration is that SparrowDoor is being executed via cmd.exe commands. This could imply that the initial access was through some means that allowed the execution of commands, such as exploiting a vulnerability that provides command execution capabilities.

Remote code execution vulnerabilities often allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the target system, which aligns with the execution of SparrowDoor via cmd.exe.

Furthermore, the use of an encrypted HTTPS channel for C&C communication suggests that the attackers are using established and encrypted protocols to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

Given all this, it seems plausible that the initial access was indeed through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.

However, it's important to note that there are other possible initial access vectors. For example, phishing attacks could have been used to gain initial access, and then the attacker could have used cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor and set up C&C communication.

But, based on the information provided, exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities seems like a likely scenario.

Therefore, I would choose answer A: Yes, it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for initial access.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
