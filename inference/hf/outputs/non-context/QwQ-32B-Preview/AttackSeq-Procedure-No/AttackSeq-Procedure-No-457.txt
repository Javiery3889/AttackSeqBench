To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the proposed sequence makes sense in the context of typical attack patterns.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection:**
   - This sounds like social engineering, possibly phishing, where attackers send fake documents to specific targets to trick them into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code.

2. **Exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access:**
   - Ghostscript is an interpreter for PostScript and PDF files. A vulnerability in Ghostscript could be exploited to execute code remotely.
   - HWP (Hangul Word Processor) is a word processing software popular in South Korea. Malicious HWP files could contain exploit code targeting Ghostscript.

3. **Using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion:**
   - EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is a file format for graphics that uses PostScript language. Simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files might be used to evade detection by security systems.

Now, the question is whether attackers will exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access only after using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.

Let's evaluate this step by step:

- **Initial Access via HWP files exploiting Ghostscript:**
  - HWP files can embed PostScript code, which could exploit vulnerabilities in Ghostscript when rendered.
  - This seems like a plausible initial access vector, especially if the target uses software that processes HWP files and has Ghostscript installed.

- **Defense Evasion through simplified PostScript in EPS files:**
  - Using simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files could make the malicious code less conspicuous, helping it evade detection by security solutions.
  - This technique could be used in conjunction with or separately from the initial access vector.

The question suggests that the exploitation of Ghostscript through HWP files for initial access happens only after using simplified PostScript in EPS files for defense evasion. Is this a logical sequence?

- It's possible that attackers first use defense evasion techniques to establish a foothold or to prepare the environment for a more significant exploit.
- However, the sequence isn't strictly necessary. Attackers might use different techniques at different stages of the attack, and the specific sequence described may not be a standard approach.

Given that, the answer is likely "No," because there's no inherent requirement for attackers to use simplified PostScript in EPS files for defense evasion before exploiting Ghostscript through HWP files for initial access. These could be separate steps or even parallel tactics depending on the attack strategy.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
