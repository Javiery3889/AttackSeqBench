I need to answer this question about the XAgent app and its behavior on iOS 7 devices. The question is a bit complex, so I'll break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the XAgent app collects a list of processes for discovery. This sounds like part of the reconnaissance phase in an attack, where the malware gathers information about the system it's running on. So, the app is gathering data about running processes, which could be useful for the attacker to understand the environment better.

Next, it asks whether, after collecting this list of processes, the app is likely to execute by hiding its icon and running in the background, but only after sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 (command and control) server.

So, there are a few key points here:

1. The app collects process information.

2. It sends this information via HTTP to a C2 server.

3. After sending the data, it hides its icon and runs in the background.

The question is asking whether this sequence of actions is likely for the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.

Now, I need to think about how malware typically behaves on iOS devices, especially on version 7. iOS is known for its security features, such as sandboxing and app review processes, which make it harder for malware to operate. However, there have been instances where malware managed to bypass these protections, so it's possible.

Let's consider each part of the sequence:

1. Collecting process information: This seems plausible. Malware often gathers as much information as possible about the system it's running on to better tailor its actions.

2. Sending data to a C2 server: This is a common behavior for malware. Attackers need to receive the information gathered by the malware to make further decisions or to use the data for other purposes.

3. Hiding its icon and running in the background: This also makes sense from a malware perspective. Malware typically tries to remain undetected by the user, so hiding its icon and running invisibly in the background helps achieve that.

However, I need to consider whether this sequence is likely specifically for the XAgent app on iOS 7.

I'm not entirely familiar with the XAgent app specifically, but I do know that there have been malware strains targeting iOS devices, and they often exhibit similar behaviors.

Moreover, iOS 7 was released in 2013, and at that time, there were already known vulnerabilities that malware could exploit to gain higher privileges or bypass certain security features.

Given that, it's plausible that the XAgent app could perform these actions on iOS 7 devices.

But let's think about the sequence:

- Collect process information.

- Send the data via HTTP to C2.

- Then hide its icon and run in the background.

Is this a logical sequence?

Yes, it is. The app first gathers information, exfiltrates it, and then attempts to hide itself to continue running without the user's knowledge.

Alternatively, one might think that hiding itself first before sending data could be a way to avoid detection, but sending data is a critical step that needs to be accomplished, so ensuring that happens before hiding might not be the most logical approach.

Wait, actually, perhaps the app hides itself first to avoid detection while sending the data. But the question specifies that it sends the data out via HTTP first and then hides.

Hmm, maybe the sequence is:

- Collect data.

- Send data.

- Then hide.

From a malware perspective, sending data first is important because if it hides first and then sends data, there's a risk that the user might interfere or that the app might be terminated before the data is sent.

So, sending data first makes sense from ensuring that the exfiltration occurs before hiding.

Additionally, hiding the icon and running in the background would make the app less noticeable to the user, reducing the chance of it being discovered and removed.

Therefore, the sequence makes sense.

Given that, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that the app will execute in this manner.

But the question says "is it likely that the app will execute by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices only after sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server?"

So, considering all of the above, I think the answer is yes, it is likely.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
