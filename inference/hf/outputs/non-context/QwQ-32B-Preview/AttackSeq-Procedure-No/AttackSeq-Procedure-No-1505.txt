So I've got this question here about RIG EK and its use of encrypted exploit code and proxy servers in their infrastructure. Let me try to break this down.

First off, RIG EK is a exploit kit that's been around for a while. I know that exploit kits are used by attackers to deliver malware to victims' systems, usually through drive-by downloads or other sneaky methods.

The question mentions that RIG EK uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for encrypting exploit code and establishing an encrypted channel for command and control (C2) operations. RC4 is an old stream cipher that's been used in various protocols, but it's known to have some security issues, which is why it's being phased out in many places. However, attackers might still use it because it's simple and fast.

So, the question is asking whether, given that RIG EK uses this encrypted communication, it's likely that they also use proxy servers within their infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

Let's look at the answer choices: A: Yes and B: No.

I need to decide which one makes more sense based on the information provided.

First, thinking about why attackers might use proxy servers: Proxy servers can help obfuscate the origin of malicious traffic, make it harder to block individual IP addresses, and generally add a layer of anonymity between the attacker and the victim. So, from an attacker's perspective, using proxies can be beneficial for evading detection and staying under the radar.

Now, considering that RIG EK is already employing encryption for its exploit code and C2 communications, which is another way to hide their activities from network monitoring tools and security professionals, it seems consistent that they would also use proxy servers to further conceal their operations.

In fact, many advanced threat actors use a combination of techniques to evade detection, including encryption, domain generation algorithms, fast-flux networks, and proxy servers.

So, given that RIG EK is already taking steps to encrypt their communications, it's plausible that they would also use proxy servers as part of their infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

Therefore, I think the answer is A: Yes.

But let me consider the other side as well. Maybe there's a reason why they wouldn't use proxy servers.

Well, using proxy servers adds complexity to the infrastructure. It requires maintaining a network of proxies, ensuring they're available and not blocked, and managing the traffic through them efficiently. If RIG EK operators feel that their encryption is sufficient to evade detection, maybe they don't see the need to use proxies.

However, in practice, relying solely on encryption for evasion isn't always enough, especially since security tools are getting better at detecting encrypted malicious traffic through other means, like behavior analysis or known bad signatures.

Moreover, using proxies can help in bypassing geoblocking or accessing targets that have specific network restrictions.

Given all that, it still seems more likely that RIG EK would use proxy servers in addition to encryption to enhance their evasion capabilities.

So, my final answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
