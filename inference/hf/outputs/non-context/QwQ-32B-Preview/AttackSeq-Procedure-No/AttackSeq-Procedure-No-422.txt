To answer this question, I need to analyze the given information and determine whether it's likely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

First, let's break down the components of the question:

1. **Phishing Emails**: The campaign uses phishing emails as an initial attack vector.

2. **Malicious Attachment**: These emails contain a malicious Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.

3. **Exploiting CVE-2018-13379**: After initial access, the attackers are expected to exploit this specific vulnerability in FortiOS devices.

My task is to assess the likelihood of this sequence of events.

### Step 1: Understanding the Attack Sequence

1. **Initial Access via Phishing**: Phishing emails are a common method for initial access. Attachments like 'Richard_Johnson.doc' are often used to deliver malware.

2. **Exploiting FortiOS Vulnerability**: After gaining initial access, attackers might look for internal systems to exploit, such as firewalls or other network devices.

### Step 2: Researching CVE-2018-13379

CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiOS SSL-VPN portal. It allows unauthenticated remote code execution due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the handling of HTTP requests.

- **Impact**: High, as it can lead to complete compromise of the device.

- **Exploitation**: Requires the attacker to send specially crafted HTTP requests to the SSL-VPN portal.

### Step 3: Linking Phishing to FortiOS Exploitation

I need to consider whether it makes sense for attackers who gain initial access through phishing to then target FortiOS devices.

1. **Target Environment**: FortiOS is commonly used in enterprise environments for firewall and VPN purposes.

2. **Post-Initial Access Actions**: After gaining access through phishing, attackers often perform lateral movement to access more critical systems.

3. **FortiOS as a Target**: Exploiting FortiOS could provide attackers with a persistent backdoor or allow them to intercept encrypted traffic.

### Step 4: Assessing Likelihood

1. **Plausibility**: It is plausible that attackers, after gaining initial access, would look for FortiOS devices to exploit, especially if they are part of the network's security infrastructure.

2. **Motivation**: Compromising FortiOS devices can provide significant advantages, such as bypassing security measures or maintaining persistent access.

3. **Technical Feasibility**: If the network uses FortiOS devices and the vulnerability is present and unpatched, exploitation is feasible.

### Step 5: Considering Alternatives

1. **Other Targets**: Attackers might have other targets in mind, such as servers, workstations, or other network devices.

2. **Opportunity and Risk**: Exploiting FortiOS might be riskier if it triggers alerts or requires more sophisticated techniques.

### Step 6: Making a Decision

Given that the attackers have already gained initial access through phishing, it is reasonable to assume that they might attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in the network's security devices, such as FortiOS, to enhance their access or persistence.

Therefore, it is likely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

**Final Answer: A**
