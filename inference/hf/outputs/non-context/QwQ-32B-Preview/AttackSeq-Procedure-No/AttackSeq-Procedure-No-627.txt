To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to understand the context provided:

- There's a campaign called CostaRicto, which uses a backdoor called SombRAT.

- This backdoor communicates with command and control (C2) servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

- The question is about what happens during the "Discovery phase" after this communication is established.

Specifically, it's asking whether it's likely that the backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during this phase.

Let's clarify some terms:

- **Command and Control (C2) servers**: These are servers controlled by the attackers that communicate with the malware installed on the victim's system.

- **Protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP**: This is a technique used to encapsulate one protocol within another to evade detection. DNS (Domain Name System) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) are commonly used because they are usually allowed through firewalls.

- **Discovery phase**: In the context of cybersecurity and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the discovery phase refers to the stage where the malware gathers information about the compromised system and the network it's connected to. This information helps the attackers understand the environment and plan their next steps.

Now, let's look at the specific techniques mentioned:

- **Process discovery**: This involves the malware identifying running processes on the system. Attackers might do this to find specific processes to target, to avoid detection by security software, or to hijack processes for their own purposes.

- **System information discovery**: This refers to gathering details about the system itself, such as operating system version, installed software, hardware specifications, and other configuration details. This information can be crucial for the attackers to choose the right exploits or tools for further compromise.

Given that the backdoor has already established communication with the C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, it's reasonable to assume that the next step would be for the malware to gather information about the system and the network. This is a common pattern in cyber attacks, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the "Discovery" tactics include various sub-techniques, such as process discovery and system information discovery, which align with what's mentioned in the question.

Therefore, it's highly likely that after establishing the C2 channel, the backdoor would proceed to perform discovery activities to understand the environment it's operating in.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the context and the typical behavior of malware in such scenarios, the most plausible answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
