So I've got this question here about the Derusbi malware and its C2 interactions. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

First off, Derusbi is a type of malware, specifically a remote access Trojan (RAT), which means it's designed to provide attackers with remote control over an infected system. One of its key functions is to gather system information and communicate this data back to the attackers' command and control (C2) servers.

The question mentions that Derusbi gathers system information and beacons this data to the C2 infrastructure using destination port 443. Port 443 is typically used for HTTPS traffic, which is encrypted and commonly used for web communications. Using this port helps the malware blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.

Now, the question is asking whether, after performing these actions, Derusbi is likely to use Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for its C2 interactions. The answer choices are simply "A: Yes" and "B: No," so I need to decide between these two options based on what I know about Derusbi and how malware typically uses cloud services for C2.

Let me think about why malware might use cloud services like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for C2. These services can provide a convenient and low-maintenance way for attackers to communicate with their malware. They're also often already allowed through firewalls, since legitimate business and personal use of these services is common.

However, I need to consider whether Derusbi specifically is likely to use these services. To answer this, I should look into what I know about Derusbi's C2 mechanisms.

Derusbi, also known as RoyalCli, is known to use HTTP and HTTPS for C2 communications. Given that it's already using port 443 for beaming data, it's likely that its C2 communications are over HTTPS, which is standard for port 443.

But the question is about whether it's likely to use specific cloud services like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive. I need to consider whether Derusbi has been observed using these services in the past.

Upon checking available resources and reports on Derusbi, I don't find any specific indications that Derusbi uses Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for its C2 communications. Derusbi is known to use traditional C2 servers over HTTPS, but not necessarily cloud storage services.

Moreover, using cloud storage services for C2 can have its drawbacks. For example, these services have terms of service that prohibit malicious activity, and accounts can be shut down if abusive behavior is detected. This can lead to C2 channels being disrupted, which is not ideal for the attackers.

On the other hand, some malware does use cloud services for C2. For example, some malware might use Dropbox or Google Drive to store and retrieve configuration files or to receive commands. Similarly, Amazon S3 can be used to host C2 servers or to store malware payloads.

However, in the case of Derusbi, there's no strong evidence to suggest that it uses these specific services for C2. Therefore, it's less likely that Derusbi would use Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for its C2 interactions, especially since it already has established C2 communications over port 443.

Given this analysis, I would choose answer "B: No," meaning that it is not likely for Derusbi to use these cloud services for C2 interactions.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
