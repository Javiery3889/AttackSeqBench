To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and evaluate whether the proposed actions align with typical malware behavior, specifically focusing on the Smooth Operator malware.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Action**: The malware automatically exfiltrates collected data via a second-stage payload using an HTTP GET request.

2. **Subsequent Action**: After exfiltration, it is alleged that the malware will establish communication with its command and control (C2) servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

I need to determine if this sequence is likely for the Smooth Operator malware.

### Step 1: Understanding Smooth Operator Malware

Smooth Operator is a sophisticated malware strain known for its use in targeted attacks, particularly associated with espionage activities. It is designed to maintain persistence on compromised systems and communicate with C2 servers to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.

Given its sophistication, it's reasonable to assume that Smooth Operator employs various techniques to evade detection and ensure reliable communication with its operators.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Initial Action

The initial action described is the exfiltration of data using a second-stage payload via an HTTP GET request. This suggests that the malware has already collected some data and is transmitting it to an external server.

Using HTTP for exfiltration can be risky because it may be more easily detected by network monitoring tools, especially if the traffic is not encrypted. However, some malware does use HTTP for initial exfiltration, possibly to test network conditions or to use simpler protocols for faster data transfer.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Subsequent Action

After exfiltrating data via HTTP GET, the question proposes that the malware will then establish communication with C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

#### HTTPS Communication

Switching to HTTPS for C2 communications makes sense for several reasons:

1. **Encryption**: HTTPS provides encryption, making it harder for network monitoring tools to inspect the content of the messages. This can help the malware avoid detection by security solutions that rely on traffic analysis.

2. **Legitimacy**: Many legitimate websites use HTTPS, so using HTTPS for C2 communications can make the malware's traffic blend in with normal traffic, reducing the likelihood of standing out to network defenders.

3. **Reliability**: HTTPS is a standard protocol, and using it can help ensure that communications are not easily disrupted by network-level defenses.

#### Custom Data Encoding Algorithm

Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation adds another layer of complexity to the malware's communication. This can serve to:

1. **Further Obfuscate Data**: Even if the data is encrypted at the transport layer (HTTPS), encoding the data before encryption can make it harder for advanced monitoring tools to analyze the content, especially if the encoding algorithm is unknown or proprietary.

2. **Evasion Techniques**: Custom encoding can help evade signature-based detection mechanisms that look for specific patterns in the data. By encoding the data, the patterns are altered, potentially allowing the malware to bypass these defenses.

### Step 4: Considering the Sequence

The sequence described—exfiltrating data via HTTP GET and then switching to HTTPS with custom encoding for C2 communications—appears plausible for a sophisticated malware like Smooth Operator.

1. **Initial Exfiltration via HTTP**: This could be a preliminary step to quickly offload data without investing too much in evasive measures, possibly to assess the network environment.

2. **Switching to HTTPS with Custom Encoding**: After initial exfiltration, the malware adopts more secure and obfuscated communication methods to ensure长期 persistence and to avoid detection by security systems.

This approach balances the need for speed in exfiltrating data with the necessity of maintaining stealth and security for ongoing operations.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Given the sophistication of Smooth Operator and the benefits of switching to HTTPS with custom encoding for C2 communications, it is likely that the malware would follow such a sequence of actions.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
