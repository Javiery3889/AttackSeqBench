So I've got this question here about RIG EK, which I know is a exploit kit that's been around for a while. The question is asking whether, after using proxy servers to hide infections, it's likely that RIG EK's exploit server will use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic as another server hosted in the same CDN for its command and control operations.

First, I need to make sure I understand all the terms here. Proxy servers are like intermediaries that pass requests from clients to servers, and they can be used to mask the origin of traffic or to route it through different paths to avoid detection. Domain fronting is a technique where the domain name used in the application layer (like in an HTTP host header) is different from the domain name used at the transport layer (like in the SSL/TLS handshake). This can be used to make network traffic appear as if it's going to one domain when it's actually going to another.

So, the question is basically asking if, after using proxies to obfuscate infections, RIG EK is likely to use domain fronting for its C2 operations to make the traffic look like it's going to a different server in the same content delivery network (CDN).

Let me think about this step by step.

First, RIG EK has been using proxies to make infections harder to detect. That makes sense because proxies can help hide the true source or destination of the traffic, making it tougher for security systems to trace back to the actual malicious servers.

Now, the next step is whether it's likely that they would use domain fronting for their C2 operations. Domain fronting can be an effective way to hide the true destination of the traffic because the external connection appears to be going to a legitimate domain, but internally, it's being redirected to the actual malicious server within the same CDN.

Given that RIG EK is already employing proxies to hide infections, it's plausible that they would use domain fronting as an additional layer of obfuscation for their C2 communications. This would help them evade detection and blocking efforts, as the traffic would appear to be going to a legitimate site.

On the other hand, domain fronting has been a technique used by various malware and APT groups in the past, so it's not unheard of for exploit kits to use it.

But I should also consider whether RIG EK has been observed using domain fronting in the past. I don't have specific intelligence on RIG EK's current tactics, but historically, exploit kits do evolve their techniques to stay ahead of defenses.

Moreover, CDNs are commonly used by both legitimate services and malicious actors because they provide scalability and can help bypass geographic restrictions or blocks.

So, considering that RIG EK is already using proxies and that domain fronting is a known technique for hiding C2 communications, especially within CDNs, it does seem likely that they might use domain fronting for this purpose.

Therefore, I think the answer is "Yes," it is likely that RIG EK's exploit server will use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic as another server hosted in the same CDN for its command and control operations.
