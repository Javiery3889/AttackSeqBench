So I've got this question here about Emissary Panda and their activities related to some vulnerabilities and tools. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Emissary Panda scanned the network using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144. Then, it asks if it's likely that they uploaded various tools and custom backdoors, like HyperBro, after exploiting a different vulnerability, CVE-2019-0604, to gain initial access by installing webshells on SharePoint servers.

Okay, so there are a few things to untangle here. Let's start by understanding what these CVEs are.

CVE-2017-0144 is related to a vulnerability in Microsoft's SMBv1 protocol, which is similar to the one exploited by EternalBlue, a famous exploit used by malware like WannaCry. So, scanning for CVE-2017-0144 suggests that they were looking for systems vulnerable to this specific SMB vulnerability.

On the other hand, CVE-2019-0604 is a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint, which could be exploited to run arbitrary code on the server.

Now, the sequence of events described is:

1. Scanning for CVE-2017-0144.

2. Exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access by installing webshells on SharePoint servers.

3. Uploading tools and backdoors like HyperBro after gaining access.

The question is asking whether it's likely that they uploaded these tools only after exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability.

Let's think about this logically.

First, they scanned the network for systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144. This suggests they were looking for systems with SMBv1 enabled, which could be exploited to gain initial access or spread laterally in the network.

However, they actually used CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access by installing webshells on SharePoint servers. This means that the initial foothold was through the SharePoint vulnerability, not through the SMB vulnerability.

After gaining initial access via the SharePoint vulnerability, they then uploaded various tools and backdoors, including HyperBro.

So, the sequence is:

- Scan for SMB vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144).

- Exploit SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access.

- Upload tools and backdoors after gaining access.

The question is whether it's likely that they uploaded the tools only after exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability.

Well, yes, that makes sense. They need to gain access first before they can upload any tools or backdoors. So, exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability to install webshells would give them the initial access, and then they can use that access to upload additional tools.

But wait, there's a scan for SMB vulnerability mentioned before exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability. Maybe they scanned the network for SMB vulnerability but ended up using a different vector (SharePoint) for initial access.

This suggests that they might have tried multiple avenues for gaining access, and successfully used the SharePoint vulnerability.

So, in this scenario, it's plausible that they uploaded the tools after gaining access through the SharePoint vulnerability.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that they uploaded a variety of tools and custom backdoors after exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability to gain initial access.

But let's consider if there's any reason to think otherwise.

Perhaps they could have uploaded some tools during the initial access phase, but the question specifies that they uploaded a variety of tools and custom backdoors only after exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability.

Given that, and considering that initial access was gained through SharePoint, it makes sense that any further tool uploads would occur after gaining that initial access.

Hence, the likely answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**
