So I've got this question here about a malware called KerrDown. It seems like it's being delivered through malicious Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable something called DLL side-loading. The question is asking whether, after delivery, the Office document is likely to use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload, but only based on the victim's system architecture, and then contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

Alright, first things first, I need to break this down. KerrDown is a type of malware, and it's being delivered via two main methods: malicious Office documents with macros and RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading. DLL side-loading is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in the same directory as a legitimate executable, and the application loads the malicious DLL instead of the intended one.

So, the Office document part: it's likely that the document contains macros, which are small programs that can automate tasks in Office applications. However, macros can also be used to deliver malware. The question mentions that the document might use base64 blobs to execute the payload. Base64 is a way of encoding binary data as text, which can be useful for embedding files or code within text-based documents or scripts.

The payload execution based on the victim's system architecture makes sense because malware needs to be compatible with the target's operating system architecture, whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit.

Lastly, the question mentions that the document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. This seems a bit contradictory because if the document is using base64 blobs to execute the payload, why would it need an image instructing the user to enable macros? Usually, enabling macros is a step required for the macros to run, but if the document is already executing payload via base64, maybe the image is just a decoy or part of the social engineering aspect.

Now, looking at the answer choices: A is Yes, and B is No. I need to decide which one is more plausible based on the attack sequence described.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Delivery mechanism: Malicious Office documents with macros or RAR archives with DLL side-loading.

2. Execution method: Using base64 blobs to execute payload based on system architecture.

3. Presence of an image instructing to enable macros.

First, regarding the delivery via Office documents with macros: this is a common method. Attackers often rely on social engineering to trick users into enabling macros, which then execute the malware.

Second, using base64 to encode the payload is also a known technique. It helps in obfuscating the malicious code and making it harder to detect by security software.

Third, considering the payload execution is based on the victim's system architecture, that makes sense because the malware needs to be compatible with the target's OS.

Now, the part about containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros seems a bit off. If the document is already executing the payload via base64, why would it need to instruct the user to enable macros? Maybe the image is there to distract or deceive the user while the actual payload is being executed through a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the image is part of a social engineering ploy to make the document look more legitimate, while the base64-encoded payload is executed in the background without user interaction.

But, in reality, if the document is using base64 to execute the payload, it might not necessarily need the user to enable macros, depending on how the base64 data is being decoded and executed.

Wait a minute, in Office documents, macros are often used to decode base64 strings and execute the decoded payload. So, in that case, enabling macros would be necessary for the payload to be executed.

Therefore, if the document is using base64 blobs to execute the payload, it likely requires the macros to be enabled first.

Hence, it makes sense for the document to contain an image instructing the user to enable macros, as that is a crucial step for the payload to be executed.

So, putting it all together:

- The document contains macros that use base64 to encode the payload.

- The payload is executed based on the victim's system architecture.

- The document contains an image instructing the user to enable macros.

This sequence seems plausible.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

But, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any scenarios where this sequence might not hold.

For example, perhaps there are methods to execute base64-encoded payloads without relying on macros being enabled. Maybe through exploit techniques that don't require macro execution, or perhaps using other features of Office like formula abuse in Excel or DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) commands.

However, based on the specific description provided, which mentions using base64 blobs to execute the payload based on system architecture and containing an image to instruct enabling macros, it seems consistent with the typical approach of using macros to execute encoded payloads.

Hence, I think A: Yes, is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
