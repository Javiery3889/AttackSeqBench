To answer this question, I need to understand the behavior of the Korplug variant, specifically regarding its use of ICMP for command and control (C2) communications after collecting data from various sources.

First, I should recall what Korplug is. Korplug is a malware strain that has been observed in targeted attacks, particularly associated with the threat group known as Lazarus. It's known for its modular design and ability to perform various malicious activities, including data exfiltration and remote control of infected systems.

Now, focusing on the question: "Will the Korplug variant use ICMP in C2 communications after collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives?"

Let's break this down:

1. **Data Collection**: The malware collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This is a common step in many malware operations, especially those aimed at exfiltrating sensitive information.

2. **C2 Communications using ICMP**: The question is whether, after collecting this data, the Korplug variant will use ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for communicating with its command and control servers.

ICMP is often used in covert channels because it's less likely to be monitored or blocked compared to other protocols like HTTP or DNS. Malware authors might choose ICMP to hide their communications within normal network traffic.

Given that Korplug is a sophisticated malware associated with a nation-state actor (Lazarus), it's plausible that it employs advanced techniques, including the use of ICMP for C2 communications, to evade detection.

However, to answer this question accurately, I need to consider whether there is evidence or documentation suggesting that Korplug uses ICMP for C2, especially after data collection.

Upon reviewing available resources and threat intelligence reports on Korplug, I find that while Korplug is known to use various communication methods, specific mention of ICMP for C2 is not prominent in the reports I've accessed. Typically, Korplug has been observed using more conventional channels like HTTP or DNS for C2 communications.

Moreover, using ICMP for data exfiltration after collecting sensitive information might raise flags, as unusual ICMP traffic could be detected by network security monitoring tools.

Therefore, based on the available information, it seems less likely that the Korplug variant would use ICMP for C2 communications after collecting data from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
