To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the Deep Panda threat group, particularly focusing on the use of the Milestone backdoor and the Fire Chili kernel rootkit. The question presents a specific sequence of events and asks whether Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) only after performing system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

First, let's break down the components mentioned in the question:

1. **Milestone Backdoor:**
   - Ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
   - Creates a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.

2. **Fire Chili Kernel Rootkit:**
   - Used for Defense Evasion.
   - Employs Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM).

3. **System Information Discovery:**
   - Likely involves gathering details about the compromised system.

4. **Screen Capture Functionalities:**
   - Involves capturing screenshots from the victim's machine.

The question is essentially asking whether the deployment of the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion via DKOM occurs only after the threat actors have performed system information discovery and screen capture activities.

To answer this, I need to consider the typical sequence of operations for threat groups like Deep Panda and the logical order in which they would employ different tools and techniques.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Persistence Mechanism (Milestone Backdoor):**
   - The Milestone backdoor is used to ensure that the threat actors maintain access to the compromised system even after reboots or other interruptions.
   - This is often one of the early steps in an intrusion, as establishing persistence is crucial before proceeding with further activities.

2. **System Information Discovery:**
   - After gaining access and ensuring persistence, threat actors typically gather information about the compromised system.
   - This includes details such as operating system version, installed software, network configuration, and other relevant data that can help them understand the environment and plan their next steps.

3. **Screen Capture Functionalities:**
   - Capturing screenshots can be useful for various purposes, such as monitoring user activities, gathering sensitive information, or confirming that certain operations have been successfully executed.
   - This activity usually occurs after the initial foothold has been established and some level of system understanding has been achieved.

4. **Defense Evasion (Fire Chili Kernel Rootkit):**
   - The deployment of a kernel rootkit like Fire Chili is a significant step aimed at hiding the threat actors' activities from detection tools and security mechanisms.
   - Using DKOM, the rootkit can manipulate kernel objects to hide processes, files, network connections, and other artifacts that could reveal the presence of the threat actors.

Now, considering the sequence:

- Establish persistence with the Milestone backdoor.
- Perform system information discovery.
- Execute screen capture functionalities.
- Deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion.

Is this a plausible sequence?

**Reasoning:**

- **Persistence First:** It makes sense to establish persistence early on to ensure that the threat actors can return to the system even if their initial access is disrupted.

- **Information Discovery:** Gathering system information is a logical next step to understand the environment and plan further actions.

- **Screen Capture:** This activity can occur at various points during the intrusion, depending on what the threat actors are trying to achieve. It might be used for initial reconnaissance or for specific operational purposes later on.

- **Defense Evasion:** Deploying a rootkit for defense evasion is typically done to hide the threat actors' activities and maintain stealth. This could be done at different points during the intrusion, but often it's implemented early on to ensure that their presence remains undetected throughout the operation.

However, the question specifies whether the deployment of the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion using DKOM occurs only after system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

**Considerations:**

- **Timing of Defense Evasion:** Implementing defense evasion measures early can help protect the threat actors' activities from the outset. Waiting until after performing system information discovery and screen capture could potentially expose their activities to detection mechanisms in place before the rootkit is deployed.

- **Operational Security:** Threat actors generally prioritize maintaining stealth and avoiding detection. Therefore, deploying defense evasion techniques as soon as possible after gaining access is a common practice.

- **Sequence Dependency:** There might be a dependency in the sequence of operations. For example, deploying the rootkit might be necessary before performing certain activities to ensure those activities remain hidden.

Given these considerations, it seems counterintuitive for the threat actors to perform system information discovery and screen capture before deploying the defense evasion measures. It would be more logical to deploy the rootkit early on to hide their activities from the beginning.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the typical tactics and procedures of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Deep Panda, it is unlikely that they would deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion using DKOM only after performing system information discovery and screen capture functionalities. Instead, they would likely deploy such a rootkit early in the intrusion process to ensure their activities remain hidden from the start.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
