I've got this question here about some malware called Milestone backdoor and an actor called Deep Panda. The question is a bit technical, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, first, the Milestone backdoor copies itself to a specific location in the app data folder and creates a service in the registry. Then, the question is asking whether, after doing that, Deep Panda is likely to install a self-generated certificate into the local trust store before moving on to discovering system information and capturing screens.

Okay, let's start by understanding what each of these actions means.

First, the Milestone backdoor copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry. This sounds like standard persistence mechanisms used by malware. By copying itself to the app data folder and creating a registry service, it ensures that it starts automatically when the system boots up, effectively maintaining a persistent presence on the compromised system.

Now, the next step mentioned is installing a self-generated certificate into the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher. This seems a bit unusual at first glance. Typically, installing a certificate into the local trust store allows the certificate to be trusted by the operating system, meaning any software signed with this certificate would be considered trustworthy by the system. This could be useful for the malware to sign its own payloads or to intercept encrypted communications without triggering security alerts.

But is this a likely step for Deep Panda to take after ensuring persistence? I need to think about the purpose of each action in the context of a malware's lifecycle.

Persistence is usually one of the first things malware establishes after initial infection to ensure it can maintain access to the compromised system across reboots or other interruptions. Once persistence is achieved, the malware typically proceeds to perform its intended functions, which could include exfiltrating data, conducting reconnaissance, or deploying additional payloads.

Installing a certificate into the local trust store seems like an advanced step that might not be necessary for all malware operations. It would be particularly useful if the malware needs to perform activities that require trust, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, signing malicious code to avoid antivirus detection, or encrypting communications to evade network monitoring.

Given that the question mentions that after these actions, the malware proceeds with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities, I need to assess whether installing a certificate would be beneficial or necessary for these activities.

System information discovery and screen capture don't inherently require the installation of a certificate. These activities can be performed without needing to sign code or intercept encrypted communications. However, if the malware needs to communicate with its command and control server securely or if it needs to sign its payloads to avoid detection by antivirus software, then having a trusted certificate could be advantageous.

But is this a likely step? In many malware families, especially more sophisticated ones like those potentially associated with state-sponsored groups (assuming Deep Panda is such a group), the use of digital certificates to sign malware is not uncommon. They might use legitimate certificates obtained through compromise or purchase, or they might generate their own certificates and install them into the trust store of targeted systems.

However, generating and installing a self-signed certificate as a root CA and Trusted Publisher is a significant action that could be detected by security software and would leave notable traces on the system. It's a relatively noisy activity that might raise alarms if the system is being monitored properly.

Given that, I need to consider whether this step is necessary for the malware's operation. If the malware can perform its functions without installing a certificate, it might choose not to take this risk.

On the other hand, if the malware needs to sign its payloads or conduct activities that require trust, then installing a certificate would be necessary.

Looking back at the question, it mentions that after ensuring persistence, the malware installs the certificate before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture. The question is whether this is likely.

I need to think about the sequence of events. Does installing a certificate make sense before conducting system information discovery and screen capture?

Perhaps. If the malware needs to download additional components or communicate with its C2 server in a way that requires trust, having a certificate installed would be necessary beforehand.

Alternatively, maybe the certificate is used to sign the payloads that are used for system information discovery and screen capture, to avoid detection by antivirus software.

Another possibility is that the certificate is used to establish a secure channel for exfiltrating the data collected from system information discovery and screen captures.

Given these potential uses, it seems that installing a certificate could be a useful step for the malware to take before proceeding with its operational activities.

However, I should also consider whether this is a common practice among malware authors. While some sophisticated malware does use certificates to sign their payloads or for secure communications, not all malware takes this step. Some might rely on other methods to avoid detection or to ensure the integrity of their communications.

Moreover, installing a certificate into the local trust store is a notable action that could be detected by security software or during incident response investigations. Therefore, malware authors might weigh the benefits against the risks of being detected.

Given that, is it likely that Deep Panda would take this step?

I need to consider who Deep Panda is. A quick search suggests that Deep Panda is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group associated with China, known for targeting various sectors including government, think tanks, and technology companies.

Given that Deep Panda is an APT group, they are likely to employ sophisticated techniques to maintain access and evade detection. Therefore, using self-signed certificates to sign their malware or to establish secure communications could be within their capabilities and operational practices.

In fact, many APT groups use such techniques to enhance the stealthiness of their operations.

Additionally, installing a certificate as a root CA and Trusted Publisher would allow the malware to sign its payloads on the fly, making them appear as trusted software to the operating system, which could help evade antivirus detection.

Furthermore, having a root CA certificate installed allows the malware to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on SSL/TLS communications, which could be useful for exfiltrating sensitive data or for maintaining access.

Given these potential benefits, it seems plausible that Deep Panda would install a self-generated certificate into the local trust store as part of their infection process.

Moreover, performing this action after ensuring persistence makes sense because once persistence is achieved, the malware has more time to carry out its activities without the risk of being removed during system reboots.

Therefore, in the sequence described, installing the certificate after ensuring persistence and before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture aligns with the operational phases of many malware families, especially sophisticated ones like those used by APT groups.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the likely operational practices of an APT group like Deep Panda, it is plausible that they would install a self-generated certificate into the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

So, the answer to the question is likely "Yes."
