So I've got this question here about the Dropping Elephant backdoor and its tactics after it steals Google Chrome credentials. The question is whether it's likely to evade defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what the Dropping Elephant backdoor is. A quick search tells me that Dropping Elephant is a type of malware, specifically a backdoor, which means it's designed to maintain access to a compromised system and allow attackers to control it remotely. Backdoors can perform various actions, including stealing data, executing commands, and downloading other malware.

Now, the question mentions that after stealing Chrome credentials, the backdoor is likely to decode encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts to download more malware. So, let's consider the steps involved here:

1. **Stealing Chrome Credentials:** This is a common tactic used by malware to gain access to a user's online accounts, which can provide valuable information or be used for further attacks.

2. **Decoding Encoded Blobs:** This suggests that the malware is using some form of obfuscation to hide its activities. Encoding scripts can make them harder for security solutions to detect.

3. **Using PowerShell:** PowerShell is a powerful scripting language used in Windows systems. It's often abused by malware because it's widely available and can execute a wide range of commands and scripts.

4. **Downloading Additional Malware:** This is a common behavior for backdoors. They might download other tools or malware to further compromise the system or carry out specific attacks.

So, is this sequence of actions likely for the Dropping Elephant backdoor to evade defenses?

Well, using encoded PowerShell scripts is a known technique for evading detection. Security solutions might not always detect encoded scripts, especially if the encoding method is less common or if the scripts are dynamically generated.

Moreover, leveraging legitimate tools like PowerShell is a common tactic in living off the land, which means using the system's own tools for malicious purposes. This can help malware blend in with normal system activities and avoid triggering security alerts.

Additionally, downloading additional malware can help the attackers customize their attack based on the target's environment, making the attack more effective.

Given this information, it seems plausible that the Dropping Elephant backdoor would use such tactics to evade defenses.

But, to make sure, I should consider if there are any reasons why this might not be the case.

One possible consideration is that if the backdoor is already present on the system, it might not need to download additional malware. However, in many cases, backdoors do download extra tools to carry out specific tasks or to maintain persistence.

Another consideration is that using PowerShell might be detected by some security solutions, especially if they have behavior monitoring or signature-based detection for known malicious scripts.

However, the question is about the likelihood of this sequence occurring to evade defenses, not about whether it's foolproof.

Considering all this, it seems reasonable to conclude that yes, the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to use decoded PowerShell scripts to download additional malware as a way to evade defenses.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
