To answer this question, I need to consider the behavior of malware, specifically focusing on the steps involved in communication with command and control (C2) servers and the subsequent actions of stealing information and encrypting it.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Communication with C2 servers using non-standard ports:** Malware often uses non-standard ports to evade detection by firewalls and security systems that may not monitor all ports equally. Ports like UDP 6999 or TCP 55556 are less likely to be scrutinized compared to standard ports like HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443).

2. **Stealing information from SNS applications:** This refers to social networking services (SNS) like Facebook, Twitter, etc., where personal information is stored. Malware designed to steal such information would need to access these applications or their data stores.

3. **Encrypting the stolen data using AES:** Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a strong encryption method used to protect data. Malware might encrypt stolen data to make it harder for security systems to inspect the content being exfiltrated.

Now, considering the sequence:

- **Communication with C2 servers first:** It's common for malware to establish a connection with its C2 server before performing any malicious activities. This allows the attacker to issue commands remotely and receive instructions on what data to steal and how to exfiltrate it.

- **Stealing information:** Once the connection is established, the malware can receive commands to steal specific types of data, such as login credentials, messages, or other sensitive information from SNS applications.

- **Encrypting the data:** Before sending the stolen data back to the C2 server, the malware encrypts it to prevent interception and to maintain the confidentiality of the exfiltrated information.

Given this sequence, it is plausible that WinDealer would communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports before stealing information and encrypting it.

However, the question is whether it is "likely" that WinDealer will follow this sequence. To answer this, we need to consider typical malware behavior and any specific characteristics of WinDealer, if known.

Generally, malware does follow such a sequence:

1. **Establish communication with C2:** This is a standard procedure for many malware strains to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

2. **Perform data theft:** Based on received commands, the malware proceeds to steal specified types of data.

3. **Encrypt the data:** To ensure the data remains confidential and to evade detection during transmission.

Using non-standard ports is also a common tactic to avoid detection by security systems that may not monitor all ports equally.

Therefore, based on general malware behavior, it is likely that WinDealer would follow this sequence.

However, without specific information about WinDealer's capabilities and behavior, we cannot be certain. But given that this sequence aligns with common malware practices, it is a reasonable assumption.

Thus, the answer is likely "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
