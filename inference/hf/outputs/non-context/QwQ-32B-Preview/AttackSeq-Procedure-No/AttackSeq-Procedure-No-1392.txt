To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics and techniques (TTPs) attributed to the threat actor group FIN13 and determine if the described sequence is plausible based on their known behavior.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Threat Actor Group**: FIN13

2. **Sequence of Actions**:

   a. Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module.

   b. Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

The question is asking whether this sequence is likely for FIN13.

### Step 1: Understanding FIN13

FIN13, also known as Bronze Union or APT29, is a sophisticated threat actor group known for targeting organizations in various sectors, including government, think tanks, and military industries. They are known for their use of living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) and custom malware to conduct espionage and data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence of TTPs

#### Action a: Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module.

- **AWS Secrets Manager**: A service that helps protect access to applications, services, and IT resources without the upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs of operating your own infrastructure.

- **enum_secrets module**: This suggests a custom or known module designed to enumerate and extract secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

Given that FIN13 is known for targeting organizations with access to sensitive information, it is plausible that they would target cloud services like AWS to retrieve sensitive data, including secrets stored in Secrets Manager.

#### Action b: Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

- **Native OS binaries**: Tools like `netstat`, `arp`, `ipconfig`, `tasklist`, etc., which are part of the operating system and do not require additional software.

- **Reconnaissance**: Collecting information about the target environment to understand the network topology, active processes, running services, etc.

FIN13 is known for using living-off-the-land techniques, which involve using native OS tools to perform malicious activities. This approach helps them avoid detection by security solutions that may not monitor legitimate system utilities.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Sequence

The sequence described is:

1. Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.

2. Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries.

#### Plausibility:

- **Order of Operations**: It makes sense that after gaining initial access and potentially escalating privileges, the threat actor would first try to harvest as much sensitive information as possible, including credentials and secrets stored in services like AWS Secrets Manager. This information can be invaluable for further lateral movement and maintaining persistence within the target network.

- **Use of `enum_secrets` Module**: This suggests a targeted approach towards cloud-based secrets management, which aligns with FIN13's known tactics of targeting sensitive information.

- **Reconnaissance Using Native OS Binaries**: After obtaining initial secrets, conducting reconnaissance using native tools is a standard procedure to map the environment and identify high-value targets or resources.

Given that FIN13 is known for using both custom tools and native OS binaries, this sequence appears plausible.

### Step 4: Considering Alternatives

- **Alternative Sequences**: It's possible that reconnaissance could be conducted before attempting to retrieve secrets, but in this case, the sequence suggests that secrets are retrieved first, which could provide credentials needed for more effective reconnaissance.

- **Dependency on Credentials**: Accessing AWS Secrets Manager likely requires specific credentials or permissions. If FIN13 has obtained these credentials through initial compromise, it makes sense to exploit that access immediately to retrieve additional secrets that could facilitate further operations.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, it is likely that FIN13 would follow the sequence of retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager before conducting reconnaissance using native OS binaries. This sequence aligns with their known tactics of targeting sensitive information and using living-off-the-land techniques for stealth and effectiveness.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
