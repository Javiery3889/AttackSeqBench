I've got this question here about APT10 and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for discovery. So, they're gathering information about the target network and systems.

Then, it asks whether APT10 is likely to abuse a compromised Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server's Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure before staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

Whew, that's a mouthful! Let's simplify it.

So, after reconnaissance, APT10 has to move laterally within the network to access more sensitive information. The question is asking if, in this scenario, they would prefer to use a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement rather than using shared MSP infrastructure.

Then, they stage the exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

I need to decide if this sequence of actions is likely for APT10.

First, let's recall what APT10 is known for. APT10, also known as Stone Panda, MenuPass, and others, is a Chinese state-sponsored threat group known for targeting industries like aerospace, healthcare, telecommunications, and more.

They are known for their sophisticated tactics, including spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and using living-off-the-land binaries for evasion.

Now, regarding lateral movement, APT10 has been observed using various methods, including Pass-the-Hash, Pass-the-Ticket, and exploiting misconfigurations in network services.

AD FS is a service that allows for federated identity management, using SAML tokens for authentication and authorization across different domains.

If APT10 compromises an AD FS server, they could potentially abuse the SAML tokens to gain access to other resources within the network or even external resources that trust the AD FS server.

On the other hand, leveraging shared MSP infrastructure might involve using credentials or access provided by a Managed Service Provider who manages IT services for the target organization.

So, the question is, which one is more likely for APT10 to use for lateral movement in this scenario.

Given that APT10 is a sophisticated threat actor, they would likely choose the method that provides them with the most access and stealth.

Abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token could give them broad access to various applications and resources that rely on AD FS for authentication.

Alternatively, using shared MSP infrastructure might provide them with administrative access to manage IT services, which could also be very beneficial.

However, the question seems to suggest that APT10 would choose one over the other.

Given that AD FS is specifically related to identity federation, which is a high-value target, compromising it could provide extensive access.

Moreover, using SAML tokens for lateral movement is a technique that aligns with APT10's sophistication level.

But, to make an informed decision, I should look into known APT10 TTPs and see if they have previously used such techniques.

Looking back at some APT10 reports, I recall that they have used living-off-the-land tools and techniques that allow them to move laterally without installing additional malware.

Abusing AD FS and SAML tokens might be a technique they could employ, especially if the target environment uses AD FS extensively.

However, I don't have specific information on whether APT10 has used this exact method.

But, considering their capabilities and the value of such a compromise, it's plausible.

Now, regarding the MSP infrastructure, if the target organization uses an MSP, and that MSP has shared infrastructure or credentials, APT10 might find it beneficial to leverage that for lateral movement.

This could provide them with access to multiple clients of the MSP, increasing their attack surface.

But again, I don't have specific information on APT10 using this method.

Given that, I need to decide which one is more likely based on general knowledge of APT groups' behaviors.

Sophisticated APT groups often aim for high-value targets and use techniques that provide broad access with minimal detection.

Compromising an AD FS server and abusing SAML tokens could fit this profile, as it allows them to access multiple applications and resources with legitimate credentials, making their activities harder to detect.

On the other hand, leveraging MSP infrastructure might also provide extensive access but could be more noticeable if the MSP has monitoring in place.

Therefore, from a stealth perspective, abusing AD FS SAML tokens might be more advantageous.

Additionally, staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools is also a technique aimed at evading detection.

Using the Recycle Bin might be seen as less suspicious, as it's a normal location for temporary storage.

Compressing the data makes it easier to transfer large amounts discreetly.

Given all this, the sequence described seems plausible for APT10.

But the question is asking if they are likely to choose abusing AD FS SAML tokens for lateral movement instead of leveraging MSP infrastructure.

"Instead of" suggests that they would prefer one over the other.

Given that both methods could provide broad access, the choice might depend on the specific target environment and which one is more effectively concealed.

However, based on the information available, it's reasonable to assume that APT10 would choose to abuse AD FS SAML tokens for lateral movement in this scenario.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

But to be thorough, I should consider if there are any reasons why this sequence might not be plausible.

One possible consideration is that compromising AD FS and abusing SAML tokens might require specific vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that aren't always present.

If the AD FS server is well-protected, APT10 might opt for the MSP infrastructure as a more reliable path.

However, APT10 is known for their ability to find and exploit such vulnerabilities, so it's still plausible that they would attempt to compromise AD FS.

Another consideration is that using MSP infrastructure might be more straightforward if the MSP has poor security practices, making it easier for APT10 to gain access.

But again, given APT10's capabilities, they might prefer the more sophisticated approach of abusing AD FS.

In conclusion, based on the information available and the plausibility of the sequence described, it seems likely that APT10 would choose to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure, followed by staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**
