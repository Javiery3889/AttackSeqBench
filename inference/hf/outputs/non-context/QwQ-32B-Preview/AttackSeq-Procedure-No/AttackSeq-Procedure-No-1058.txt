To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of events described and evaluate whether the final PowerShell script would likely lead to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT.

First, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. An obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script named myScript.ps1.

2. The question is whether this myScript.ps1 will lead to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT.

Now, let's consider what each component might imply:

- **Obfuscated batch script**: This suggests that there is an attempt to hide or make the batch script difficult to understand, likely for malicious purposes.

- **Executing a PowerShell script (myScript.ps1)**: PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can perform a wide range of tasks, including those that are malicious.

- **Communication using Telnet for command and control**: Telnet is a protocol that provides a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal. It's not typically used for command and control in modern malware due to its lack of encryption and because it's less common, making it easier to detect.

- **njRAT**: njRAT is a remote access trojan that can provide attackers with a wide range of capabilities, including keylogging, screen capture, file management, and more. It's designed for command and control purposes.

Given this context, the question is whether the execution of myScript.ps1, after being called by an obfuscated batch script, would lead to using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT.

To evaluate this, I need to consider the likelihood and plausibility of each option.

First, let's consider why someone might choose Telnet over njRAT for command and control:

- **Telnet**: As mentioned, Telnet is not encrypted, which makes it easier to detect and intercept. It's also less common in modern malware, which might make it stand out more in network traffic.

- **njRAT**: This is a full-featured RAT that provides extensive capabilities for attackers. It's likely more sophisticated and harder to detect than simple Telnet-based communication.

Given that, it seems counterintuitive for an attacker to choose Telnet over njRAT for command and control, especially if njRAT is already available and provides more functionality.

However, there might be specific scenarios where an attacker prefers simplicity and minimalism, even at the cost of security and functionality. For example, in an environment where njRAT might be detected by security measures, an attacker might opt for a more basic approach like Telnet to avoid detection.

But, in general, njRAT would be a more powerful and flexible choice for command and control.

Now, considering the sequence of events:

- An obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script.

- The PowerShell script could do anything, but the question is about its likely outcome in terms of command and control communication.

Given that the batch script is obfuscated and is executing a PowerShell script, it's more likely that the PowerShell script is being used to download or execute a more sophisticated payload, such as njRAT, rather than setting up a simple Telnet-based command and control.

Moreover, njRAT can be delivered via PowerShell scripts, and it's a common method for attackers to use PowerShell for execution and persistence.

On the other hand, setting up Telnet for command and control would require configuring the target system to use Telnet, which is not typically enabled by default on modern systems. This would involve additional steps and might be more conspicuous.

Therefore, it's less likely that the final PowerShell script would lead to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT.

Based on this analysis, the answer should be "No," meaning it is not likely that the final PowerShell script will lead to communication using Telnet for command and control instead of njRAT.

**Final Answer: B**
