I have this question here about RIG EK and its tactics. RIG EK is a exploit kit that's been around for a while, and I know it's involved in malvertising campaigns. The question is asking whether it's likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

Let's break this down. First, I need to understand what RIG EK typically does. RIG EK is known for exploiting vulnerabilities in browsers and their plugins, like Flash or Java, to drop malware onto victims' systems. Malvertising is a common delivery method for exploit kits, where malicious ads are placed on legitimate websites, and when users click on them or even just view them, they are redirected to a landing page hosting the exploit kit.

Now, the question mentions that RIG EK redirects users to advertising pages or compromised websites only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter. This sounds a bit confusing because typically, in exploit kit scenarios, the redirection happens before any malware is executed on the victim's system. The exploit kit analyzes the victim's browser and serves an exploit accordingly, and if successful, drops a payload, which could be malware like ransomware or banking Trojans.

So, in the usual sequence, it's:

1. User encounters malvertising on a legitimate site.

2. Malvertising redirects the user to the exploit kit's landing page.

3. Exploit kit scans the browser for vulnerabilities.

4. If a vulnerability is found, the exploit kit serves an exploit.

5. The exploit executes and drops the payload (malware).

6. The malware then may use various techniques, including PowerShell scripts, to further infect the system or download additional payloads.

But according to the question, it's suggesting that the obfuscated PowerShell script is run first to fetch the malware, implying that the redirection to advertising pages or compromised websites happens after this script is executed. This seems counterintuitive to the typical exploit kit process I just outlined.

Let me think about this differently. Maybe the question is referring to a specific variant or a modified approach where PowerShell is used as part of the infection chain. I know that cybercriminals often use PowerShell for executing commands and scripts on Windows systems because it's a built-in scripting language and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including downloading and executing malware.

So, perhaps in some cases, the exploit kit drops a PowerShell script instead of a traditional executable payload. This script would then be obfuscated to avoid detection and would be responsible for fetching the actual malware from a command and control server.

However, in the sequence described in the question, it seems to suggest that the PowerShell script is run first, and then redirection occurs. That doesn't make much sense because redirection typically happens before any malware is executed on the victim's system.

Alternatively, maybe the question is poorly phrased, and it's trying to ask whether RIG EK uses PowerShell scripts as part of its payload after the exploit is successful.

Given that, let's consider the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on my understanding, the typical process of RIG EK doesn't involve running a PowerShell script to fetch malware before redirection to advertising or compromised websites. Redirection happens as part of the malvertising campaign to lead the user to the exploit kit's landing page.

However, it's possible that after the exploit is successful, the dropped payload could involve PowerShell scripts for further actions, like downloading additional malware.

But according to the sequence described in the question, it seems to suggest that the PowerShell script is run first, and then redirection occurs, which doesn't align with standard exploit kit behavior.

Therefore, I would lean towards answer choice B: No, it's not likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.

But to be thorough, I should consider if there are any scenarios where this might be possible.

Perhaps in some advanced campaigns, attackers might use a combination of techniques. For example, they could use a malvertising campaign to deliver a small JavaScript or Flash-based exploit that, upon success, executes a PowerShell script on the victim's system. This script could then be used to download and execute the actual malware.

In this case, the redirection to the exploit kit's landing page would still happen before any local execution on the victim's system. The PowerShell script would be part of the post-exploitation phase, not preceding the redirection.

Therefore, even in this scenario, the sequence described in the question doesn't match the typical or expected behavior.

Another possibility is that the question is referring to a different type of attack vector, not necessarily an exploit kit, but something else that uses malvertising and PowerShell together in a different sequence.

However, given that the question specifically mentions RIG EK, which is an exploit kit known for its malvertising-based distribution, it's essential to stick to what's known about RIG EK's tactics.

In summary, based on my knowledge of RIG EK and exploit kits in general, the sequence described in the question doesn't align with typical behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B: No, it's not likely that RIG EK operates in the manner described.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
