To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics and techniques described and determine if the proposed sequence is plausible based on my knowledge of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and typical adversary behavior.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Adversary Group**: FamousSparrow

2. **Techniques Mentioned**:

   - **Credential Access**: Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials from compromised systems.

   - **Discovery**: Collecting system information and probing files.

The question is asking whether it's likely that FamousSparrow will perform Discovery activities only after completing Credential Access.

Now, let's consider the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand the typical sequence of adversary actions.

**MITRE ATT&CK Framework Context**:

- **Initial Access**: The adversary gains an initial foothold in the target network.

- **Execution**: The adversary runs malicious code on the target system.

- **Persistence**: The adversary ensures they can maintain access to the target system across reboot and potential detection attempts.

- **Privilege Escalation**: The adversary tries to gain higher-level permissions on the system.

- **Defense Evasion**: The adversary takes steps to avoid detection by security solutions.

- **Credential Access**: The adversary attempts to steal account names and passwords, keys, and other access tokens.

- **Discovery**: The adversary gathers information about the target network and systems to plan follow-on actions.

- **Lateral Movement**: The adversary moves through the network to access other systems and resources.

- **Collection**: The adversary gathers data of interest to their goal.

- **Exfiltration**: The adversary transfers stolen data out of the target network.

- **Command and Control**: The adversary communicates with compromised systems to control them.

- **Impact**: The adversary causes disruption, degradation, or destruction to the target network.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, these tactics are not strictly sequential; adversaries may perform multiple tactics in parallel or in a different order based on their objectives and the target environment.

**Analyzing the Sequence**:

The question suggests that FamousSparrow will perform Discovery only after Credential Access. Let's evaluate if this sequence makes sense.

- **Credential Access before Discovery**:

  - Credential Access typically involves stealing credentials to gain access to other systems or to escalate privileges.

  - Discovery activities involve understanding the environment, identifying valuable data, and mapping the network.

  - In many attack scenarios, adversaries perform Discovery early in the attack to understand the environment and identify high-value targets.

- **Plausibility of Sequence**:

  - It's not uncommon for adversaries to perform Discovery activities early on to gather information about the network and systems.

  - Credential Access is often performed to gain higher privileges or access to other systems, which might be identified during the Discovery phase.

  - However, in some cases, adversaries might perform Credential Access early to gain additional access before conducting extensive Discovery.

- **Custom Version of Mimikatz**:

  - Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential dumping.

  - A custom version might include evasion techniques to avoid detection by security products.

- **After Credential Access**:

  - If adversaries have successfully dumped credentials, they might use these credentials to access other systems and then perform Discovery on those systems.

  - Alternatively, they might use the credentials to escalate privileges on the current system before performing further Discovery.

**Considering Adversary Behavior**:

- Adversaries often perform Discovery activities repeatedly throughout the attack lifecycle as they move laterally and access new systems.

- It's plausible that Discovery activities could occur after Credential Access, especially if the credentials are used to access new systems where further Discovery is needed.

- However, it's also common for adversaries to perform initial Discovery to identify targets and then proceed with Credential Access to gain access to those targets.

**Conclusion**:

Given the typical adversary behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it's not necessarily unlikely for an adversary to perform Discovery after Credential Access, especially if the credentials are used to access new systems where further Discovery is required.

However, the question specifies "only after dumping credentials," implying that no Discovery activities occur before Credential Access.

This might not align with common adversary behavior, as Discovery is often performed early in the attack to understand the environment and identify targets.

Therefore, while it's possible, it might not be the most likely sequence.

Given the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I would choose B: No, because it's not likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

Adversaries often perform Discovery activities early in the attack lifecycle to gather information about the environment and identify high-value targets, which may inform their Credential Access activities.

**Final Answer: B**
