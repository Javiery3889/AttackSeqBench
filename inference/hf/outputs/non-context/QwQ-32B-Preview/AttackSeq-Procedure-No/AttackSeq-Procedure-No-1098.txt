To answer this question, we need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if it's plausible that CosmicDuke, a hypothetical threat actor, would compress output data using a custom LZW algorithm before exfiltrating data via FTP.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Searching Removable Drives:** This suggests that the threat actor is looking for data on USB drives or other removable media.

2. **Skipping Certain File Types During Collection:** The actor is selective about the types of files they collect, possibly focusing on specific file extensions or types that are more valuable or relevant to their objectives.

3. **Compressing Output Data with a Custom LZW Algorithm:** LZW is a lossless data compression algorithm. Using a custom implementation suggests that the actor wants to obfuscate the data or reduce its size for exfiltration.

4. **Exfiltrating Data via FTP:** File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server.

Now, let's consider whether this sequence of actions makes sense for a threat actor like CosmicDuke.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Searching Removable Drives:**
   - It's common for threat actors to target removable drives as they can contain sensitive information and may be used to bypass network security measures.

2. **Skipping Certain File Types:**
   - This indicates that the actor has specific data in mind, such as documents, spreadsheets, or other files that contain valuable information. This selective approach helps in focusing resources on the most pertinent data.

3. **Compressing Data with Custom LZW:**
   - Compressing data can help reduce the size of the exfiltrated files, making the transfer faster and less noticeable. Using a custom implementation of LZW might be an attempt to evade detection by security tools that look for standard compression methods.

4. **Exfiltrating via FTP:**
   - FTP is a straightforward protocol for transferring files, but it's also well-monitored and often blocked by security systems. Using FTP for exfiltration could be risky unless the actor has a specific reason to believe it's safe.

**Evaluation of Plausibility:**

- **Compression Necessity:** If the data being exfiltrated is already in a compressed format (like ZIP files), additional compression might not be necessary. However, if the collected data is large and consists of uncompressed files, compression would be beneficial.

- **Custom Implementation:** Using a custom compression algorithm could help evade detection by security tools that signature-based detection for known compression methods. This adds an extra layer of stealth.

- **FTP as Exfiltration Method:** FTP is an older protocol and is often logged and monitored. Modern threat actors might prefer more secure and less conspicuous methods like encrypted channels (HTTPS, SFTP) or even tunneling through legitimate services.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the actor is already taking steps to be selective in the data they collect and using a custom compression algorithm to avoid detection, it's plausible that they would take additional precautions in the exfiltration method. However, choosing FTP as the exfiltration method might be risky unless the actor has a specific reason to believe it's safe in this context.

Therefore, while the sequence makes some sense, there might be more sophisticated methods for exfiltration that the actor could employ. Nonetheless, based on the information provided, it is possible that CosmicDuke would follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
