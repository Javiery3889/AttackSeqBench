So I've got this question here about some cyber attack sequence involving something called the SLUB backdoor. It seems like the backdoor does some discovery by downloading a snippet from GitHub and then executes commands based on that. After that, the question is asking whether it's likely that attackers will exfiltrate data by creating archive files of users' Desktop folders, post download links to a Slack channel, and then build CAB files.

I need to choose between "Yes" and "No" for this scenario. To answer this, I should probably understand what typically happens in such attack sequences and see if this particular sequence makes sense.

First, let's break down the steps mentioned:

1. **SLUB backdoor performs discovery:** This likely means that the backdoor is gathering information about the compromised system. It downloads a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parses it for commands to execute. Gists are a way to share code snippets on GitHub, so this could be a command and control (C2) mechanism where attackers send instructions to the backdoor.

2. **Exfiltrate data by creating archive files of users' Desktop folders:** After discovery, the attackers want to steal data, specifically from the Desktop folders of users on the system.

3. **Post download links to a Slack channel:** Instead of directly exfiltrating the data, they create download links and post them in a Slack channel. This might be a way to collect the data indirectly, perhaps to avoid detection or to make it harder to trace back to the attackers.

4. **Build CAB files:** Finally, they build CAB files. CAB stands for Cabinet, which is a file format used for storing multiple files in a compressed format, similar to ZIP files.

Now, I need to evaluate if this sequence is plausible.

First, backdoors like SLUB are indeed used for maintaining access and performing various actions on a compromised system, including data exfiltration. The use of GitHub gists for C2 is also a known tactic, as it can be difficult to block access to GitHub entirely due to its legitimate use.

Regarding data exfiltration, targeting specific folders like Desktop is logical because these folders often contain user files that may be of interest to attackers, such as documents, spreadsheets, and other sensitive information.

Using archive files to package the data before exfiltration is also common, as it reduces the number of files being transferred and can compress the data, making it faster to exfiltrate.

Now, the part about posting download links to a Slack channel is interesting. Slack is a popular communication platform, and using it to exfiltrate data could be a way to leverage legitimate channels for malicious purposes. By posting download links in a Slack channel, attackers might be trying to have accomplices or other compromised systems download the data, adding an extra layer of separation from the source.

Finally, building CAB files is another way to package data. CAB files can include compression and have been used in various malware families for storing configuration data or additional payloads.

Considering all this, the sequence seems plausible. Attackers often use multiple steps and techniques to exfiltrate data quietly and efficiently. Using social engineering platforms like Slack to handle exfiltration links adds an element of stealth, assuming that Slack traffic is trusted and less likely to be monitored closely.

However, whether this specific sequence is likely or not might depend on the attacker's objectives and the environment they're operating in. For instance, if the organization uses Slack extensively, posting links there might blend in with normal traffic.

But, given that the question is phrased in a general way, and without specific context suggesting otherwise, I would say that this sequence is plausible.

Therefore, my answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: Yes}} \]
