To answer this question, I need to analyze the given information and evaluate whether the Smooth Operator malware, after communicating with its C2 servers over HTTPS and using a custom data encoding algorithm, is likely to exfiltrate data using the MIME protocol.

First, let's break down the components mentioned in the question:

1. **Communication with C2 over HTTPS:** This indicates that the malware uses HTTPS for secure communication with its command and control servers. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, which uses TLS/SSL for encryption, ensuring that the data transmitted between the malware and the C2 server is encrypted and protected from interception.

2. **Custom data encoding algorithm:** The malware uses a custom encoding algorithm to obfuscate the data. This suggests an additional layer of protection or evasion technique to make the data harder to decipher, even if it is intercepted.

3. **Exfiltration using MIME protocol:** The question asks whether the malware is likely to use the MIME protocol for exfiltrating the collected data.

Now, let's understand what MIME is. MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard that extends the capabilities of email by allowing the use of different types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video, within email messages. It's primarily used in email communications to handle different media types.

Given that the malware is already using HTTPS for communication with its C2 servers, which is a web-based protocol, it's important to consider whether MIME would be the likely choice for exfiltrating data in this context.

HTTPS is based on the HTTP protocol, which is used for transmitting data over the web. While MIME is often used in email, it can also be used in HTTP communications to define the content type of the data being transmitted. However, in the context of HTTPS, the data is already encrypted, and the use of MIME would typically be for defining the type of data being sent, not necessarily for exfiltration purposes.

Moreover, the malware is using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, which suggests that it has its own method for encoding data before transmission. This custom encoding could be sufficient for evading detection and不需要额外的MIME封装来进一步混淆数据。

Therefore, considering that the malware is already using HTTPS for secure communication and has a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation, it is less likely that it would need to use the MIME protocol for exfiltrating data. MIME might be used internally to define the type of data being transmitted, but the exfiltration process itself would likely rely on the established HTTPS channel and the custom encoding.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
