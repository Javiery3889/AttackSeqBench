To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine if the actions attributed to TG1021 in the Discovery phase align with the activities mentioned in the Lateral Movement phase.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Lateral Movement Phase:**
   - TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
   - Dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.

2. **Discovery Phase (in question):**
   - TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files using SharpHound and PowerSploit.
   - These tools were loaded directly into the infected machines' memory.

My task is to determine if it's likely that TG1021 performed these actions during the Discovery phase based on the information about the Lateral Movement phase.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Understanding the Phases:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is typically where adversaries gather information about the target environment to plan their attack. Techniques used here often include network mapping, enumerating user accounts, and identifying valuable assets.
   - **Lateral Movement Phase:** This occurs after initial access and involves moving within the network to access other systems and deepen the intrusion.

2. **Techniques Mentioned:**
   - **SharpHound and PowerSploit:** These are tools used for reconnaissance and exploitation, respectively.
     - **SharpHound:** Used for Active Directory reconnaissance to map relationships and identify high-value targets.
     - **PowerSploit:** A collection of PowerShell scripts for penetration testing, which can be used for various tasks including reconnaissance and privilege escalation.

3. **Sequence of Events:**
   - The question states that TG1021 performed certain actions during the Lateral Movement phase, such as accessing shared folders via SMB and dropping a web shell loader.
   - It then asks if, during the Discovery phase, TG1021 likely used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.

4. **Plausibility:**
   - It is common for adversaries to perform reconnaissance early in the attack lifecycle, during the Discovery phase, to understand the environment before moving laterally.
   - Using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit in memory without leaving artifacts aligns with tactics aimed at maintaining stealth.

5. **Connection Between Phases:**
   - The information from the Discovery phase would inform the Lateral Movement phase. For example, knowing which servers have shared folders and what privileges are required to access them.
   - Therefore, it makes sense that reconnaissance activities precede lateral movement.

6. **Direct Loading to Memory:**
   - Loading tools directly into memory is a technique used to evade detection by security software that monitors file systems.
   - This aligns with the need for stealth in both Discovery and Lateral Movement phases.

**Conclusion:**

Given that reconnaissance activities are typical in the Discovery phase and that the tools mentioned (SharpHound and PowerSploit) are appropriate for such activities, it is likely that TG1021 performed these actions during the Discovery phase. This aligns with the sequence where reconnaissance informs lateral movement.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
