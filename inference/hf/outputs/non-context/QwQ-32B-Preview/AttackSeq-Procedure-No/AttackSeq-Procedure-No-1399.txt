To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the threat group FIN13 and determine whether the described sequence is plausible based on known intelligence about this group.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Exfiltration over web services**: The question mentions that FIN13 exfiltrates data using tools like web shells and JSP (Java Server Pages) tools.

2. **Use of proxies**: After exfiltration, the question asks if FIN13 is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control (C2).

3. **Data collection from network shared drives**: The question specifies that this data collection happens after exfiltration and involves archiving the data locally or remotely.

I need to evaluate whether this sequence makes sense based on what is known about FIN13's modus operandi.

**Step 1: Understanding FIN13's TTPs**

FIN13, also known as APT28, Sofacy, or Strontium, is a Russian-based advanced persistent threat group known for targeting a wide range of industries, including government, defense, energy, and technology sectors. Their tactics typically involve spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, exploiting vulnerabilities in software, and using a variety of custom and publicly available tools for initial access, persistence, and exfiltration.

**Step 2: Exfiltration Techniques**

FIN13 has been observed using various methods for exfiltrating data, including:

- **Web shells**: These are small segments of code inserted into legitimate web pages or scripts to provide remote access to the server.

- **JSP tools**: Java Server Pages can be used to create web shells or other backdoors on servers running Java.

These tools allow threat actors to maintain access and exfiltrate data stealthily.

**Step 3: Use of Proxies**

Proxies are commonly used by threat actors to obfuscate their IP addresses and routes, making it harder for defenders to trace their activities back to the source. Proxies can be used at different stages of an attack, including for C2 communications and data exfiltration.

**Step 4: Data Collection from Network Shared Drives**

Threat actors often look for sensitive data stored on network shared drives, as these can contain a wealth of information, including credentials, documents, and other valuable assets. Archiving this data locally or remotely is a standard procedure before exfiltration.

**Step 5: Sequence Analysis**

The question presents a sequence where FIN13 exfiltrates data using web shells and JSP tools over web services. Then, after collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it, they use proxies for communication and C2.

**Evaluation:**

- **Exfiltration first, then data collection**: This sequence seems counterintuitive because typically, data is collected before it is exfiltrated. Exfiltration is the act of transferring stolen data out of the target network, which would logically follow data collection.

- **Use of proxies for C2**: It is plausible that FIN13 uses proxies for C2 communications to hide their infrastructure and evade detection. However, the timing of when proxies are used in the sequence described seems off.

**Alternative Plausible Sequence:**

1. **Initial Access**: Gain entry through phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities.

2. **Persistence and Privilege Escalation**: Establish persistent access and move laterally within the network.

3. **Data Collection**: Search for and collect sensitive data from various sources, including network shared drives.

4. **Data Archiving**: Compress and prepare the data for exfiltration.

5. **Exfiltration**: Use web shells, JSP tools, or other methods to exfiltrate the data, possibly employing proxies to mask the C2 communications and the exfiltration process.

Given this typical sequence, the sequence presented in the question seems inverted: exfiltration occurs before data collection and archiving, which doesn't make logical sense.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question does not align with the expected sequence of events in a FIN13 attack. Therefore, the answer is "No," FIN13 is not likely to use proxies for communication and C2 only after collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it locally or remotely using utilities and libraries, following exfiltration over web services.

**Final Answer: B: No**
