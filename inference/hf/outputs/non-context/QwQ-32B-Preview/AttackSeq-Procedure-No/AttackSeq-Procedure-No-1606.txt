To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are being described and determine whether SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access:** Gained through malicious LNK files.
2. **Delivery of Payloads:** Via a convoluted infection chain.
3. **Activities in Question:** Is SideCopy likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting?

I need to evaluate whether, in this sequence, SideCopy would engage in capturing mouse movements or API hooking prior to deploying njRAT for credential harvesting.

**Understanding the Components:**

- **Malicious LNK Files:** These are Windows shortcut files that can contain commands to execute malicious code when opened.
- **Convolution Infection Chain:** This suggests a multi-stage process where the initial payload leads to subsequent downloads or executions of other malware components.
- **SideCopy:** This appears to be a component or a tool used in the attack. I need to research what SideCopy is and its typical functionalities.
- **API Hooking:** This is a technique where an attacker intercepts calls to APIs to manipulate data or control flow.
- **njRAT:** A remote access trojan that can be used for various malicious activities, including credential harvesting.

**Research on SideCopy:**

Upon researching, SideCopy seems to be a tool or a technique used in malware for various purposes, possibly related to process injection or data exfiltration. However, specific details about SideCopy are not widely documented, so I need to make some educated inferences based on common malware behaviors.

**Sequence of Events:**

1. **Initial Access:** Malicious LNK files are used to gain initial access.
2. **Payload Delivery:** Through a convoluted infection chain, suggesting multiple steps to download and execute malware components.
3. **SideCopy Activities:** Capture mouse movements or perform API hooking.
4. **Deployment of njRAT:** For credential harvesting.

**Evaluating the Sequence:**

- **Capturing Mouse Movements:** This could be a way for malware to gather information about user behavior or to bypass security measures that rely on mouse movements (e.g., avoiding automated click detection).
- **API Hooking:** This is a common technique used by malware to intercept and modify API calls, which can be used for various purposes such as hiding processes, modifying data, or gaining deeper system access.

Given that njRAT is being deployed for credential harvesting, it's likely that prior steps are taken to ensure the malware operates undetected and has the necessary access to harvest credentials.

**Is SideCopy Likely to Capture Mouse Movements or Perform API Hooking?**

- **Capture Mouse Movements:** While possible, this seems less directly related to the primary goal of credential harvesting. However, it could be a secondary function to evade detection or gather additional information.
- **API Hooking:** This is more aligned with common malware behaviors aimed at gaining deeper system access and avoiding detection. API hooking can help njRAT hide its activities or manipulate system functions to steal credentials more effectively.

Given this, it's more plausible that SideCopy would perform API hooking rather than capturing mouse movements, especially if the end goal is to deploy njRAT for credential harvesting.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the context, it's more likely that SideCopy would perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting, rather than capturing mouse movements. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
