To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine the likelihood of lateral movement occurring after the mentioned activities.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **APT-TOCS uses PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control operations.**

   - **PowerShell usage:** PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and shell developed by Microsoft. It's commonly used by administrators for task automation and configuration management. However, its capabilities also make it attractive for attackers, as it can be used to execute commands and scripts without needing to write files to disk, which can help evade detection.

   - **Downloading encrypted data scripts:** This suggests that the malware is fetching additional payloads or instructions from a command and control (C2) server. Encrypting these scripts helps to obfuscate their content, making it harder for security solutions to inspect and block them.

   - **Command and control operations:** This indicates that the malware is communicating with an external server controlled by the attackers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

Given this context, the sequence of events so far involves initial access, possibly persistence, and communication with a C2 server.

Now, the question is whether, after these actions, the APT is likely to exhibit lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.

**Lateral Movement:**

Lateral movement refers to an attacker's efforts to move through a network to access sensitive data or critical systems. This often involves moving from the initial entry point to other parts of the network, potentially compromising additional machines and expanding access.

**Network Projection:**

Network projection is a technique where an attacker creates or manipulates network connections to facilitate movement within the target environment. This could involve setting up new network routes, using VPNs, or other methods to gain access to different network segments.

Considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, lateral movement is a common step in an APT's lifecycle after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network. Attackers typically seek to move laterally to access more sensitive information or to establish persistence in multiple locations.

Given that the APT has already used PowerShell for downloading encrypted scripts and is engaged in C2 operations, it is plausible that the next step would be to move laterally within the network to spread the infection and increase their access.

Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes," as lateral movement is a standard procedure for APTs to expand their control within a target network.

**Final Answer: A**
