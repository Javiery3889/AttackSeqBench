So I've got this question here about the Hidden Cobra group and their tactics. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Hidden Cobra used the Bankshot malware implant for reconnaissance. So, they're gathering information on victim organizations. That makes sense; reconnaissance is all about gathering intel before launching a more significant attack.

Then, it asks whether it's likely that after this, the group would send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials, still during the reconnaissance phase.

Okay, so we have to decide if this sequence makes sense.

Let's think about the MITRE ATT&CK framework. I know that in ATT&CK, the initial access tactic involves various methods attackers use to get into a system. Reconnaissance is more about gathering information before making the first move.

Bankshot being a malware implant suggests that they've already gained access to some systems for reconnaissance purposes. So, they've probably already performed initial access and are now using the implant to look around.

Now, sending phishing messages via Telegram to harvest credentials seems like another initial access vector. Essentially, they're trying to get more people or systems compromised by tricking users into giving up their credentials.

But the question is, is this something they would do during the reconnaissance phase?

Hmm.

In my experience, reconnaissance is about gathering information without being detected. It's about understanding the target's environment, their defenses, their routines, etc. Once they have enough intelligence, they plan and execute the actual attack.

Using a malware implant like Bankshot for reconnaissance is a stealthy approach. They can monitor systems, exfiltrate data quietly, and learn about the network.

Sending phishing messages, on the other hand, is a more aggressive step. It risks alerting the victim organization if the phishing attempt is detected or blocked.

So, from a tactical perspective, performing reconnaissance and then immediately sending phishing messages seems a bit contradictory. The reconnaissance phase is supposed to be low and slow, avoiding detection.

Moreover, harvesting credentials via phishing is more aligned with initial access tactics rather than reconnaissance.

Perhaps they would use the information gathered during reconnaissance to inform their phishing attempts, making them more targeted and effective. For example, if they learn about specific IT personnel or processes, they can craft more convincing phishing messages.

But conducting phishing during the reconnaissance phase might compromise their stealth.

Additionally, the use of Telegram for phishing is interesting. Telegram is a messaging app that can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Attackers might choose it because it's widely used and can be less scrutinized than other channels.

However, the question specifies that this would happen during the reconnaissance phase, which makes me question its likelihood.

Let me consider the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide which one is more plausible.

Given that reconnaissance is about gathering information quietly, and sending phishing messages via Telegram to harvest credentials is a more aggressive step that could raise alarms, I tend to think that performing both activities simultaneously might not be the best approach for an attacker aiming to remain undetected.

Therefore, it's less likely that they would send phishing messages during the reconnaissance phase. They'd probably prefer to keep their reconnaissance discrete and only move to initial access once they have sufficient intelligence.

Hence, I would go with answer choice B: No.

It's not likely that Hidden Cobra would send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials during the reconnaissance phase. They would more likely use the information gathered from their reconnaissance to plan and execute initial access at a later stage, when the time is right and with higher chances of success.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{B}} \]
