So I've got this question here about Regin, which is a type of malware, and it's asking whether, after monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes, Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand what Regin is. Regin is a sophisticated piece of malware that's been in the news for being used in targeted attacks, and it's associated with state-sponsored activities. It's known for its complexity and the way it operates in multiple stages, allowing it to perform a variety of tasks on infected systems.

Now, the question mentions that Regin has already been monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes. So, it's already engaged in some data collection activities. The question is asking whether, during the discovery phase, it's likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files.

Let me break this down. The discovery phase in cybersecurity terms usually refers to the stage where an attacker tries to understand the environment they've infiltrated. This includes understanding what systems are present, what software is running, what vulnerabilities might exist, and so on. It's a crucial step for the attacker to plan further actions.

Gathering information on processes and memory utilization would make sense in this phase. By monitoring running processes, Regin can identify what software is installed, what services are running, and perhaps even find sensitive information or credentials that are being used by those processes. Memory utilization can also be telling; for example, certain memory patterns might indicate the presence of other security software or virtual machines, which could alert the malware to alter its behavior to avoid detection.

Scanning for deleted files is also plausible. Deleted files can contain a wealth of information, especially if they've been recently deleted and their data still resides on the disk. Tools exist that can recover deleted files, and an advanced piece of malware like Regin might include such capabilities to gather as much information as possible from the target system.

Given that Regin is a sophisticated malware tool, it's reasonable to assume that it has the capability to perform these actions. The fact that it's already monitoring network traffic suggests that it's in a phase where it's collecting data, and expanding that data collection to include local system information like processes, memory usage, and even deleted files aligns with the goals of a discovery phase.

Therefore, my answer would be "Yes," Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A**
