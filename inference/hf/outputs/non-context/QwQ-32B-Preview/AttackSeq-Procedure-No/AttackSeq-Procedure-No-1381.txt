To answer this question, I need to understand the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the threat group FIN13 and evaluate whether the described sequence is plausible based on known behaviors and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Actions:**
   - Moving laterally in the network using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells.
   - These are techniques used in the "Lateral Movement" phase of an attack.

2. **Subsequent Actions:**
   - Gathering information on services using system service discovery.
   - Obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) and trojanized KeePass binaries.

The question is asking whether it's likely that FIN13 would perform system service discovery only after obtaining credentials through the mentioned methods.

**Step 1: Understanding FIN13 TTPs**

FIN13, also known as FIN6, is a cybercrime group primarily involved in financially motivated attacks, particularly targeting point-of-sale (POS) systems to steal payment card data.

From publicly available reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, FIN13 is known to use a variety of techniques, including:

- Initial access via phishing, RDP brute-forcing, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
- Execution of payloads, often using legitimate tools and custom malware.
- Persistence mechanisms to maintain access.
- Lateral movement across the network to spread within the target environment.
- Credential access to obtain sensitive information.
- Collection and exfiltration of data, especially payment card information.

**Step 2: Sequence of TTPs**

The question presents a specific sequence:

- Lateral movement using WMI and web shells.
- Credential access via LSASS dumping and trojanized KeePass.
- System service discovery.

The key is to determine if performing system service discovery only after obtaining credentials is a plausible sequence for FIN13.

**Step 3: Analyzing the Sequence**

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, "System Service Discovery" falls under the "Discovery" tactic. This tactic involves actions attackers take to gather information about the environment they've infiltrated, which can inform their next steps.

Credential access, on the other hand, is a critical step that often occurs after initial access and persistence have been established. Credentials can be used to escalate privileges and move laterally within the network.

Considering this, it's important to think about the timing of these activities:

- **Early Discovery:** Attackers often perform some level of discovery early on to understand the environment and plan their movements.
- **Credential Access:** This is typically performed to gain higher privileges or access to specific systems.
- **Further Discovery:** With elevated privileges, attackers can perform more in-depth discovery to find valuable data or further expand their access.

Given this, it's plausible that an attacker would perform initial discovery, then attempt to obtain credentials to escalate their access, followed by more detailed discovery with elevated privileges.

However, the question specifies whether system service discovery is likely to be performed only after obtaining credentials. This implies that no discovery is done before credential access.

**Step 4: Evaluating Plausibility**

In practice, attackers often perform some level of discovery early in the attack to map the environment and identify their next steps. This initial discovery helps them understand the network topology, active systems, and potential targets.

Once they have a basic understanding, they might attempt to obtain credentials to gain higher privileges, which would then allow them to perform more sophisticated discovery and access sensitive areas.

Therefore, performing system service discovery only after obtaining credentials seems less likely, as initial discovery is usually performed before credential access to inform the attacker's movements and decisions.

**Step 5: Considering FIN13 Specifics**

Given that FIN13 is known for targeting POS systems, they would likely need to understand the network to locate these systems. This suggests that some level of discovery would be performed early on.

Obtaining credentials would help them access restricted areas or systems with higher privileges, but it's still plausible that they perform initial discovery with their initial access credentials.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

Based on the typical attack lifecycle and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it's more likely that attackers, including FIN13, perform some level of discovery before obtaining credentials, rather than waiting until after credential access to perform any discovery.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
