To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine whether it's plausible that the group, identified as WINDSHIFT APT, would proceed to access external victim-owned websites for target development after performing the initial reconnaissance activities.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial Actions:**
   - Using fake social media personas to gather identifiable information.
   - Employing social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents.

These actions are clearly part of the reconnaissance phase, where the attackers are trying to gather as much information as possible about their targets. This includes personal details, relationships, and communication patterns, which can be invaluable for tailoring subsequent attacks.

2. **Proposed Subsequent Action:**
   - Accessing external victim-owned websites for target development.

Target development typically involves further refining the list of targets based on the information gathered during reconnaissance. This could include identifying high-value targets within an organization or pinpointing individuals with access to sensitive information.

Now, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes adversary behaviors, I can map these activities to understand the likely next steps.

- **Reconnaissance (TA0043):**
  - This phase involves gathering information about the target organization and its members.
  - Techniques used in this phase align with what's described: using social engineering, such as creating fake personas, and exploiting mobile apps to steal data.

- **Resource Development (TA0040):**
  - This phase includes activities like setting up infrastructure and creating credentials for future operations.
  - While not directly mentioned in the question, it's possible that accessing external websites could be part of setting up such infrastructure.

- **Initial Access (TA0001):**
  - This is where the adversary gains their first foothold into the target network.
  - Accessing external victim-owned websites could be a method for initial access, especially if those websites have vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

Given that the question is about whether WINDSHIFT APT will subsequently access external victim-owned websites for target development, I need to consider whether this action follows logically from the reconnaissance activities described.

**Analysis:**

- **Plausibility:**
  - It is plausible that after gathering detailed information about the victims through social engineering and data theft, the attackers would look to further exploit this information by accessing external websites owned by the victims.
  - These websites could provide additional insights into the victim's operations, IT infrastructure, or even serve as a vector for launching more targeted attacks.

- **Purpose:**
  - For target development, accessing these websites could help in identifying key personnel, understanding internal processes, or uncovering vulnerabilities that can be exploited in future stages of the attack.

- **Risk:**
  - However, accessing external websites may also carry risks, such as triggering security alerts or leaving traces that could be attributed back to the attackers.
  - Therefore, the decision to proceed with such actions would depend on the attackers' risk appetite and the perceived value of the information gained.

**Conclusion:**

Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT would attempt to access external victim-owned websites for target development. This aligns with standard adversary behavior, where information gathered during reconnaissance is used to inform and enhance subsequent attack phases.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
