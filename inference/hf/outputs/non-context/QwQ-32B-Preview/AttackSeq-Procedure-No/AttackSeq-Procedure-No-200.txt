To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described and determine whether the GreyEnergy group would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network after using GreyEnergy mini, Nmap, and Mimikatz.

First, let's break down the components mentioned:

1. **GreyEnergy mini**: This is a variant of the GreyEnergy malware, which is known to be used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, particularly those associated with Russian cyber activities. GreyEnergy is known for its modular design, allowing it to perform various tasks such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, and more.

2. **Nmap**: A network exploration tool and security scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network. It's commonly used by attackers to map the network and identify potential targets.

3. **Mimikatz**: A tool that allows for credential dumping, enabling attackers to extract plaintext passwords, hashes, and other credentials from memory. This is crucial for lateral movement within a network.

4. **PDQ Deploy**: A software deployment tool used for managing and distributing software across a network. It's a legitimate tool but could be abused by attackers for malicious purposes.

5. **AvosLocker**: A ransomware variant that encrypts files and demands a ransom for their release. It's part of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model.

Now, considering the sequence:

- The initial compromise is done using GreyEnergy mini.

- Nmap is used to map the network.

- Mimikatz is used to collect credentials.

- The question is whether PDQ Deploy is then used to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.

To evaluate this, I need to consider the typical behavior of APT groups and the tools they use for different stages of an attack.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Initial Compromise**: GreyEnergy mini is used to gain an initial foothold in the target network. This is a common tactic where malware is deployed to access the system.

2. **Network Mapping**: Nmap is used to scan the network and identify other systems and services that can be targeted. This helps the attacker understand the network topology and find potential entry points.

3. **Credential Harvesting**: Mimikatz is used to extract credentials from the compromised system. These credentials can be used for lateral movement, allowing the attacker to access other systems within the network without needing to exploit vulnerabilities directly.

4. **Lateral Movement and Payload Delivery**: The question is about what happens next. Specifically, whether PDQ Deploy is used to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.

PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool. If it's already present in the network, an attacker might abuse it to deploy malware across the network silently and efficiently, as it's a trusted tool and its activities might not raise alarms.

However, not all networks have PDQ Deploy installed, and its presence depends on the organization's IT management tools. Therefore, relying on PDQ Deploy for lateral movement might not be a standard procedure for APT groups, as it's not universally available.

Alternatively, APT groups typically have their own set of tools for lateral movement, such as using PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), or other remote execution methods that don't rely on specific third-party tools.

Given that GreyEnergy is a modular malware, it likely includes its own capabilities for lateral movement and payload delivery. Therefore, it might not be necessary for the group to use PDQ Deploy for this purpose.

Moreover, using legitimate tools like PDQ Deploy for malicious activities is a tactic known as "living off the land," which can be effective but is not universally employed by all groups.

Considering the above points, it seems that while it's possible for the GreyEnergy group to use PDQ Deploy for moving AvosLocker and tools across the network, it's not necessarily the most plausible or likely scenario.

**Final Answer: B: No**
