To answer this question, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to the Lazarus group and determine if the described sequence is plausible based on known behaviors.

First, let's break down the question:

1. **Initial Access and Credential Access:**
   - The Lazarus group uses the Responder tool to acquire login credentials. Responder is a network tool that performs man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks to capture credentials over a network.

2. **Proposed Sequence:**
   - After gaining credential access, the group is said to conduct discovery activities like system service discovery.
   - This discovery is supposed to happen only after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.

Now, let's evaluate this sequence:

**Step 1: Understanding Lazarus Group TTPs**

The Lazarus group, also known as Hidden Cobra, is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group known for various cyber attacks, including high-profile incidents like the Sony Pictures hack and the Bangladesh Bank heist.

Based on publicly available reports and analyses, the Lazarus group employs a range of TTPs, including:

- Initial access through phishing, exploits, or supply chain compromises.
- Credential harvesting using various tools, including custom and open-source utilities.
- Lateral movement using stolen credentials and tools like PsExec, WMIC, and PowerShell.
- Establishing persistent access through backdoors and remote access tools.
- Exfiltration of data and, in some cases, deployment of destructive malware.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence Described**

The question suggests that after using Responder to gain credentials, the group would proceed directly to lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC, and only then conduct discovery activities.

Let's examine this sequence:

- **Credential Access:** Using Responder to capture credentials.
- **Lateral Movement:** Immediately using Windows commands and WMIC to move laterally, establish connections, and copy malware.
- **Discovery:** Conducting discovery activities only after lateral movement.

**Step 3: Evaluating Plausibility**

According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which catalogs adversary behaviors, discovery activities are often performed early in the attack lifecycle to gather information about the target environment. This information is crucial for an attacker to plan their next steps, including lateral movement.

Typically, the sequence would be:

1. **Initial Access:** Gain a foothold in the target network.
2. **Execution:** Execute malicious code.
3. **Persistence:** Ensure continued access.
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Gain higher-level permissions if necessary.
5. **Defense Evasion:** Avoid detection.
6. **Credential Access:** Steal credentials.
7. **Discovery:** Map the network and identify valuable targets.
8. **Lateral Movement:** Move across the network to access more systems.
9. **Collection:** Gather data of interest.
10. **Exfiltration:** Send stolen data out of the network.
11. **Impact:** Perform actions like data deletion or system disruption.

In this standard sequence, discovery activities precede lateral movement. The adversary needs to understand the environment before moving laterally to ensure they target the right systems and minimize detection.

Given this, the sequence described in the question seems inverted. It suggests that lateral movement occurs before discovery, which is not aligned with typical adversary behavior.

**Step 4: Considering Specific Tactics of Lazarus Group**

While the Lazarus group may have unique tactics, there is no publicly available information suggesting that they deviate significantly from the standard adversary behavior model outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

In fact, multiple reports indicate that Lazarus employs extensive discovery techniques to map the network before moving laterally. For example, they have been observed using tools like Nmap for network scanning and various PowerShell commands to gather system information.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Based on the standard adversary behavior model and the known TTPs of the Lazarus group, it is unlikely that they would conduct discovery activities only after lateral movement. Discovery is typically a precursor to lateral movement, allowing adversaries to make informed decisions about their next steps.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
