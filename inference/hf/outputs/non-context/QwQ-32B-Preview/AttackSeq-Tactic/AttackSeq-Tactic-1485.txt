So I've got this question here about BlackEnergy 3 and its tactics according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that BlackEnergy 3 gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() API for lateral movement. So, it's already established that there's lateral movement involved. But the question is asking about the next step: after gathering this information, the malware communicates with its command and control (C2) server using HTTP protocol. And we need to identify which ATT&CK tactic this action falls under, from the given choices: Exfiltration, Impact, Command and Control, or Lateral Movement.

Let's recall what each of these tactics entails in the ATT&CK framework:

1. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the techniques used by adversaries to steal data from the target network. It's about moving the stolen data out of the network.

2. **Impact**: This tactic includes actions that affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of victim systems or data. Think of it as the damage phase, where the adversary might delete files, encrypt data for ransom, or cause other forms of disruption.

3. **Command and Control**: This is about the communication between the malware on the victim's system and the adversary's command and control servers. It's the channel through which the adversary sends commands to the malware and receives data back.

4. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves techniques used by adversaries to move through the network, often to access more sensitive parts of the network or to establish a presence on multiple systems.

Now, the question is specifically about the malware communicating with its C2 server using HTTP protocol. This sounds like it falls directly under Command and Control. The malware is likely sending information back to the attackers and receiving further instructions or commands.

However, let's consider why it might not be the other options:

- **Exfiltration**: While data might be sent to the C2 server as part of exfiltration, the act of communicating with the C2 server isn't solely about exfiltration. It's a broader communication channel used for various purposes, including receiving commands, updating malware, etc.

- **Impact**: This tactic is more about causing harm or disruption to the system or data. Communicating with a C2 server is a preparatory step and not directly about impacting the system.

- **Lateral Movement**: Although lateral movement might involve communication over the network, it's specifically about moving from one system to another within the network. Communicating with an external C2 server is different from moving laterally within the network.

Therefore, the most appropriate tactic that describes the malware communicating with its C2 server using HTTP protocol is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C**
