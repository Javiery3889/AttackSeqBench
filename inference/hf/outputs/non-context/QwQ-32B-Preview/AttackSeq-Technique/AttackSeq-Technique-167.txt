So I've got this question here about cyber threats and it's related to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that some defense evasion methods have been employed, specifically redirecting victims to legitimate services and using domain shortening services. Then, it asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next to access credentials through phishing pages that impersonate login portals.

Okay, so the context is about phishing and credential theft, and it's asking for the most plausible technique from the given options.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: T1003.004 - LSA Secrets

B: T1090 - Proxy

C: T1587 - Develop Capabilities

D: T1056 - Input Capture

I need to understand what each of these techniques entails and see which one fits best with the scenario described.

Starting with A: T1003.004 - LSA Secrets. This seems related to stealing secrets stored in the Local Security Authority (LSA) on Windows systems. That might involve credentials, but it's more about accessing stored credentials on a compromised system, not necessarily about phishing.

Next, B: T1090 - Proxy. This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic, which could be used for evading network monitoring or to maintain access. While proxies can be used in phishing attacks, I'm not sure if this directly relates to accessing credentials through phishing pages.

Option C: T1587 - Develop Capabilities. This seems more related to developing new tools or techniques by the adversary, which doesn't directly relate to the immediate action of accessing credentials via phishing.

Finally, D: T1056 - Input Capture. This technique involves capturing user inputs, such as keystrokes or form submissions, which is directly related to phishing attacks where the goal is to capture login credentials entered by users.

Given the scenario, the attackers have redirected victims to phishing pages that impersonate login portals. The purpose is to capture the credentials entered by the victims. So, among the options, T1056 - Input Capture seems the most directly relevant.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

T1003.004 - LSA Secrets: This is more about accessing stored credentials on a system, not about capturing credentials from user input on a phishing page.

T1090 - Proxy: While proxies can be used in the infrastructure to support phishing attacks, it's not directly about capturing the credentials.

T1587 - Develop Capabilities: This seems unrelated to the immediate action of capturing credentials via phishing.

Therefore, T1056 - Input Capture is the most plausible technique that occurred after the defense evasion methods to access credentials through phishing pages.

So, my final answer is D: T1056 - Input Capture.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{D} \]
