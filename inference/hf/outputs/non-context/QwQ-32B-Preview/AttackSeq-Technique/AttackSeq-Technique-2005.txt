So I've got this question here about some cyber attack stuff, and I need to figure out which MITRE ATT&CK technique best matches what's described. Let's break it down step by step.

First, there's this thing called Scr.js that's fingerprinting the infected system and saving that info for later use. Then, there's this backdoor called KopiLuwak that starts talking to two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands. I need to find out which ATT&CK technique this corresponds to from the given options.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: T1135 - Network Share Discovery

B: T1572 - Protocol Tunneling

C: T1102 - Web Service

D: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Jobs

Okay, so I need to understand what each of these techniques involves and see which one fits the description in the question.

Starting with A: T1135 - Network Share Discovery. This is about an adversary trying to find network shares, which are folders or resources shared over a network that can be accessed by multiple users. This seems related to lateral movement or data exfiltration, but in the question, it's about a backdoor communicating with websites to receive and send commands. So, this doesn't seem directly related to that activity. Maybe not the best fit.

Next, B: T1572 - Protocol Tunneling. This technique involves an adversary encapsulating forbidden or restricted protocols within allowed protocols to evade network detection. For example, using HTTP to tunnel SSH traffic. In the scenario described, KopiLuwak is communicating with compromised websites, but there's no mention of encapsulating one protocol within another to evade detection. So, while it's possible that tunneling is involved, it's not explicitly stated, and there might be a more direct match.

Option C: T1102 - Web Service. This technique involves an adversary using a web service that is hosted on web servers or web applications to support their operations. The description in the question mentions that KopiLuwak is communicating with two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands. This sounds a lot like using a web service as a command and control channel. So, this seems quite relevant.

Lastly, D: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Jobs. This technique involves an adversary creating scheduled tasks or jobs on a system to execute malicious code at specific times or under certain conditions. However, the question is about communication with websites for commands, not about scheduling tasks on the infected system. So, this doesn't seem to fit the described activity.

Comparing all the options, T1102 - Web Service seems to be the most direct match for the scenario described, where a backdoor is communicating with compromised websites to receive and send commands. It aligns with using web services for command and control purposes.

Therefore, the answer is C: T1102 - Web Service.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{C: T1102 - Web Service}} \]
