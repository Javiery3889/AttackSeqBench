So I've got this question here about APT28 and their tactics after harvesting credentials via spear-phishing and using OLDBAIT. I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique would most likely allow them to move deeper into victim networks after exploiting internet-facing servers. The answer choices are:

A: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services

B: T1021.007 - Cloud Services

C: T1653 - Power Settings

D: T1564 - Hide Artifacts

First, I need to understand the context. APT28 is a known advanced persistent threat group, and they're using spear-phishing to harvest credentials and then using OLDBAIT, which I believe is a tool or technique associated with them for maintaining access or moving laterally within a network.

So, the sequence is:

1. Spear-phishing for credentials

2. Using OLDBAIT

3. Exploiting internet-facing servers

4. Moving deeper into the network

I need to find out which technique best fits that movement deeper into the network after exploiting internet-facing servers.

Let's look at each option:

A: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services

This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain initial access or escalate privileges. Since the question mentions exploiting internet-facing servers, this seems relevant. After gaining access to these servers, APT28 could use this technique to move laterally within the network.

B: T1021.007 - Cloud Services

This sub-technique is about using cloud services for command and control or data exfiltration. While cloud services can be part of an attack, it's not directly about moving deeper into the network after exploiting internet-facing servers.

C: T1653 - Power Settings

This technique involves modifying power settings to prevent systems from going into sleep mode or to wake them up, which can be used to maintain persistent access. It's more about sustaining access rather than moving laterally within the network.

D: T1564 - Hide Artifacts

This technique is about hiding the artifacts of an attack to evade detection. While important for maintaining stealth, it doesn't directly relate to moving deeper into the network.

Considering the sequence:

- They've already harvested credentials and used OLDBAIT, so they likely have some level of access.

- They've exploited internet-facing servers, which gives them a foothold in the network.

- Now, they need to move deeper, likely to access more sensitive information or to establish more persistent access.

Given that, Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210) seems like the most plausible next step. They can use the access they've gained on the internet-facing servers to exploit other services within the network, moving laterally to reach their target.

Cloud Services (T1021.007) might be used for C2 or exfiltration, but it doesn't directly help in moving deeper into the network. Power Settings (T1653) is more about maintaining access, and Hide Artifacts (T1564) is about evading detection.

Therefore, the most likely technique APT28 would use to move deeper into victim networks after exploiting internet-facing servers is T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services.

**Final Answer: A**
