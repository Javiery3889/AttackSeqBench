So I've got this question here about some cyber stuff, and I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique happened after some VBA code did its thing with a malicious Word document. Let's break this down.

First, there's VBA code in an external template. VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications, which is a programming language used in Microsoft Office applications. So, someone embedded some code in a template that's outside the main document. That sounds fishy right away because external templates can be used to hide malicious code.

This VBA code decrypted some data from the malicious Word document and dropped it into files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'. So, it's taking encrypted data from the document and saving it as these files. Now, I need to figure out what happens next, according to the ATT&CK framework.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter

B: T1053.002 - At

C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol

D: T1562.012 - Disable or Modify Linux Audit System

I need to think about what typically happens after files are dropped by malicious code. Let's consider each option one by one.

Option A: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter. This technique involves adversaries using command lines or scripting languages that are built into the operating system. For example, using PowerShell, cmd, bash, etc., to perform actions. Since one of the dropped files is 'fmx.ps1', which is a PowerShell script, it's likely that the next step is to execute this script using the PowerShell command interpreter. So, this seems plausible.

Option B: T1053.002 - At. This is about scheduling tasks to run at specific times using the 'at' command. While it's possible that the adversary might schedule something after dropping files, there's no direct indication in the question that scheduling is involved. So, this seems less likely compared to option A.

Option C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol. This technique involves using protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc., to exfiltrate data or issue commands. While this might be part of the attack later on, the question is specifically asking about what happens after the files are dropped, and there's no mention of network communication yet.

Option D: T1562.012 - Disable or Modify Linux Audit System. This seems way off because the initial attack is using a Microsoft Word document and VBA code, which are typically associated with Windows environments, not Linux. So, it's unlikely that the next step would be to modify a Linux audit system.

Given these considerations, option A: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter, seems to be the most logical next step. The dropped file 'fmx.ps1' is a PowerShell script, and it's likely that the adversary would use the PowerShell command interpreter to execute this script.

Therefore, my final answer is A: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter}} \]
