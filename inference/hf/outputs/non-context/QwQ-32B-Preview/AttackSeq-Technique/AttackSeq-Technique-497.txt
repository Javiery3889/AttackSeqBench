So I've got this question here about some cyber attack sequence, specifically related to the CostaRicto Campaign. It's asking about which ATT&CK technique probably happened before the stages mentioned. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being described in the question. It says that payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks to download a backdoor. Then, the CostaRicto Campaign used a PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection to inject a final payload DLL into memory. So, the sequence seems to be:

1. Payload stagers executed via scheduled tasks.

2. These stagers download a backdoor.

3. Then, the CostaRicto Campaign uses a PowerShell loader to inject a DLL into memory.

The question is asking what likely occurred before this sequence, specifically before the use of the PowerShell loader and injection of the DLL.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1587.003 - Digital Certificates

B: T1090 - Proxy

C: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job

D: T1129 - Shared Modules

I need to think about which of these techniques would logically precede the steps described.

Let's consider each option:

A: T1587.003 - Digital Certificates

This technique involves the use of digital certificates for various purposes, such as code signing, establishing trust, or encrypting communications. In the context of an attack, adversaries might use legitimate certificates or create their own to make their malicious code appear trustworthy.

If the adversaries used digital certificates to sign their payload or to establish a trusted connection for downloading the backdoor, that would make sense before executing the payload stagers. So, this could be a possible precursor to the described sequence.

B: T1090 - Proxy

This technique involves adversaries using proxies to route their malicious traffic, which can help them avoid network detection or to pivot within a network.

If the adversaries used a proxy to connect to command and control servers or to download the backdoor, that would likely happen before executing the payload stagers. So, this is another potential technique that could have occurred earlier in the attack sequence.

C: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job

This is actually mentioned in the question as the method used to execute the payload stagers. So, this is part of the sequence described, not something that happened before it.

D: T1129 - Shared Modules

This technique involves adversaries developing shared libraries or dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are used across multiple tools or operations. In the context of the question, the final payload is a DLL injected into memory, which seems related but is part of the described sequence, not necessarily before it.

Now, considering that C: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job is part of the sequence described in the question (payload stagers executed using scheduled tasks), it's likely not the answer, as the question is asking for what occurred before this sequence.

Between A, B, and D, I need to determine which one makes the most sense as a precursor to the described actions.

Let's think about the sequence again:

- Before the payload stagers are executed via scheduled tasks, there might be a need to establish a foothold or to prepare the environment.

- Using digital certificates (A) could be part of making the payloads appear legitimate, which might happen before execution.

- Using a proxy (B) could be setting up the network infrastructure to receive commands or download payloads, which also would likely occur before execution.

- Shared modules (D) might be developed beforehand, but in the context of the attack sequence, it's more about the final payload being a DLL, which is part of the execution phase.

Comparing A and B, both seem plausible, but perhaps digital certificates are more about making the payloads look legitimate, while proxies are about establishing covert communication channels.

In many attack scenarios, establishing a communication channel (using a proxy) is a critical early step, allowing the adversary to control the malware and receive data exfiltrated from the target.

On the other hand, using digital certificates could be part of the preparation to make the payloads appear legitimate, which might also happen early in the attack sequence.

However, in the context of the question, where payload stagers are executed via scheduled tasks to download a backdoor, it seems that before that, the adversaries need to have a way to communicate with the target system, likely using a proxy.

Moreover, the use of digital certificates might be more related to the execution phase, where the payloads need to bypass security measures by appearing trustworthy.

Therefore, considering that setting up a proxy for communication is a foundational step that needs to be in place before executing any payloads or downloading backdoors, I would say that T1090 - Proxy is the most likely technique that occurred before the described sequence.

So, my final answer is B: T1090 - Proxy.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
