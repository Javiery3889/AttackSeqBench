So I've got this question here about some cyber attack involving the Helminth Trojan and I need to figure out which MITRE ATT&CK technique best fits the description. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attack started with a vulnerability exploit to execute an embedded .hta file via mshta.exe. So, someone found a weakness in the system and used that to run a special file called an .hta file, which is a type of HTML application. Mshta.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used to run these .hta files.

Now, after this initial execution, the question is asking about what happened next to keep the Helminth Trojan running regularly. It's about maintaining the presence of the malware by automatically executing files at regular intervals.

So, I need to look at the answer choices and see which one best describes a technique that would allow for regular, automatic execution of files.

Let's look at each option:

A: T1070.001 - Clear Windows Event Logs

This technique is about clearing logs to hide activities. While it's a way to avoid detection, it doesn't explain how the malware maintains its presence by running automatically at regular intervals. So, this seems unrelated to the automatic execution part.

B: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job

This one sounds promising. Scheduled tasks in Windows allow you to run programs or scripts at specific times or under certain conditions. If the malware sets up a scheduled task, it can ensure that its files are executed regularly, which matches the description in the question.

C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol

This technique involves using protocols at the application layer for command and control or data exfiltration. While it's relevant for communication, it doesn't directly relate to the automatic execution of files at regular intervals.

D: T1546.001 - Change Default File Association

Changing file associations can allow malware to execute when certain file types are opened. For example, changing the default program to open .pdf files to run a malicious executable instead. However, this doesn't necessarily ensure regular, automatic execution at set intervals. It depends on user actions, like opening a .pdf file.

Comparing these options, T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job, stands out as the most directly relevant technique for achieving regular, automatic execution of files. The other options either don't relate to execution scheduling or depend on different triggers.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job.

**Final Answer: B**
