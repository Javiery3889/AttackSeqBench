So I've got this question here about some cyber attack stuff, and I need to figure out which MITRE ATT&CK technique best fits the scenario described. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attackers used HTTP and HTTPS for command and control. That makes sense because these protocols are commonly used for communication between malware and its command and control servers. They're pretty standard and can blend in with normal web traffic, making them hard to detect.

Then, it says that after using HTTP and HTTPS, Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server. So, the attackers are not only communicating with their servers but also exfiltrating dataâ€”specifically, documents that they've harvested from the target's system.

Now, I need to look at the answer choices and see which one best aligns with this action of uploading harvested documents over the C2 channel.

Option A is T1030 - Data Transfer Size Limits. This technique involves limiting the amount of data transferred at one time to avoid detection by security systems that might flag large data transfers. While this could be a related technique, it doesn't directly describe the action of uploading harvested documents.

Option B is T1137.006 - Add-ins. This seems to be related to using software add-ins, like those for office applications, to execute malicious code. While add-ins could be used as a delivery mechanism, it doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration of harvested documents.

Option C is T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique involves transmitting stolen data over the same communication channel that the malware uses to receive commands from its operators. Given that the question mentions that the modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server, this seems like a direct match.

Option D is T1106 - Native API. This technique involves using an application's native API to perform actions, which could include exfiltrating data. However, it's more about the method of interaction with the system rather than the specific action of exfiltrating data.

Comparing these options, T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel directly describes the action of sending stolen data over the command and control channel, which is exactly what's happening in this scenario. The other options are either too indirect or describe different aspects of the attack.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel}} \]
