So I've got this question here about some cyber attack stuff, and I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique best matches the description. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions "Seaduke," which is presumably a type of malware or tool used by the "Duke group." It says that Seaduke is used to retrieve system information and perform updates. Then, it talks about the Duke group communicating securely with a command and control (C2) server over HTTP/HTTPS to control Seaduke operations.

So, the key part here is the secure communication over HTTP/HTTPS. I need to find which of the given answer choices best aligns with that.

Let's look at the answer choices one by one.

Option A: T1558 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets

Kerberos is a protocol for authenticating service requests between clients and servers on a network. Stealing or forging Kerberos tickets would allow an attacker to impersonate legitimate users. But in this case, the question is about communicating with a C2 server over HTTP/HTTPS. While this could be related to authentication, it's not directly about Kerberos tickets. So, this seems less likely.

Option B: T1071.003 - Mail Protocols

This refers to using email protocols like IMAP, SMTP, or POP3 for command and control. However, the question specifies communication over HTTP/HTTPS, which is different from mail protocols. So, this doesn't seem to fit well.

Option C: T1573 - Encrypted Channel

This technique involves establishing a communication channel that is encrypted to hide the content of the messages. Since the question mentions secure communication over HTTP/HTTPS, which are encrypted protocols, this seems like a strong candidate.

Option D: T1505.002 - Transport Agent

This seems to relate to modifying transport agents like email clients to exfiltrate data or receive commands. Again, this is more about email transport rather than general HTTP/HTTPS communication.

Comparing all these, option C, T1573 - Encrypted Channel, directly relates to using encrypted methods for communication, which aligns with the secure HTTP/HTTPS communication mentioned in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1573 - Encrypted Channel.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{C: T1573-Encrypted Channel}} \]
