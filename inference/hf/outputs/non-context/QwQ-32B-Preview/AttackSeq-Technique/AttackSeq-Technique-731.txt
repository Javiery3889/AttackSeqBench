So I've got this question here about the 'Red October' campaign. It's asking about a specific technique used in the attack to hide the location of the 'mothership' server. The mothership server is likely the central command and control (C&C) server that orchestrates the entire operation. Hiding its location is crucial for the attackers to remain undetected and maintain control over the compromised systems.

First, I need to understand the context of the 'Red October' campaign. I recall that it was a sophisticated long-term espionage operation that targeted diplomatic and governmental organizations worldwide. The attack involved a variety of techniques to gain access to sensitive information.

The question mentions that after execution, the main component established communication with C&C servers and received additional spy modules. So, there's a client-side component that communicates back to the C&C server to receive further instructions or additional malware components.

Now, the specific part is about hiding the location of the mothership server. This suggests that the attackers used some method to obfuscate the true IP address or location of the server to make it harder for investigators to trace back and identify it.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter

This technique involves using native command shells or scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts. While this might be used in the attack for various tasks, it doesn't directly relate to hiding the location of the C&C server.

B: T1102.001 - Dead Drop Resolver

Dead Drop Resolver is a method where infected systems periodically check a predetermined location (like a website or a specific URI) for instructions or to exfiltrate data. This can be a way to maintain communication without directly connecting to a C&C server, thus making it harder to trace back to the attackers' infrastructure.

C: T1090 - Proxy

Using a proxy server can help hide the location of the C&C server by routing traffic through intermediate servers. This adds a layer of indirection, making it more difficult to determine the true location of the C&C server.

D: T1547.004 - Winlogon Helper DLL

This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to load a malicious DLL during the logon process. While this might be used for persistence or to execute malicious code, it doesn't directly relate to hiding the C&C server's location.

Considering the options, both B (Dead Drop Resolver) and C (Proxy) seem relevant to hiding the C&C server's location.

Let's think about Dead Drop Resolver first. In this method, the compromised systems reach out to a predefined location to retrieve instructions or upload data. The attackers can set up these dead drops on various servers, possibly using legitimate websites or benign-looking domains, to make it harder to attribute the activity to them. This indirect method of communication can indeed help hide the mothership server's location.

On the other hand, using a Proxy (option C) involves routing network traffic through intermediate servers. This can include various types of proxies, such as HTTP proxies, SOCKS proxies, or even more advanced setups like VPNs or anonymous networks like Tor. By routing C&C traffic through proxies, the attackers can mask the origin of the commands and make it difficult for network forensic analysis to trace back to the actual C&C server.

Comparing the two, while Dead Drop Resolver provides a degree of indirection, using a Proxy can offer more layers of obfuscation, especially if chains of proxies are used or if anonymous networks are involved.

However, the question specifies that after execution, the main component established communication with C&C servers and received additional spy modules. This suggests that there was a direct communication channel established between the compromised system and the C&C server, which might be more aligned with using a proxy to hide the server's location rather than using a dead drop resolver, which typically involves periodic checks for instructions.

Moreover, in the 'Red October' campaign, which was known for its sophistication and long-term operation, it's likely that the attackers employed advanced methods to hide their C&C infrastructure, possibly including the use of proxies or other anonymization techniques.

Therefore, considering the need to hide the location of the mothership server and the nature of the communication described, using a Proxy (T1090) seems like the most plausible technique.

So, my final answer is C: T1090 - Proxy.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{C: T1090 - Proxy}} \]
