So I've got this question here about some cyber attack techniques, and I need to figure out which one fits best with the scenario described. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that some malicious actors, APT-TOCS, downloaded shellcode script functionalities using PowerShell. Then, they maintained multi-beacon communication for evasion. After that, they established secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs. And I need to pick which ATT&CK technique this most likely corresponds to from the given options.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: T1654 - Log Enumeration

B: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter

C: T1573.001 - Symmetric Cryptography

D: T1573 - Encrypted Channel

Hmm, okay. So, T1654 is about Log Enumeration, which is more about collecting information from logs, not really about communication or establishing secure channels. So, that doesn't seem directly related to the secure communication part.

T1059 is about Command and Scripting Interpreter, which involves using built-in commands or scripts to perform actions. In this case, they used PowerShell, which is a scripting language, to download shellcode. So, that seems relevant, but the question is specifically asking about the establishment of secure communication using HTTP GET requests.

T1573.001 is Symmetric Cryptography, which is a specific type of encryption method. T1573 is a broader category called Encrypted Channel, which is about establishing communication channels that are encrypted to hide the data being transmitted.

Given that the question mentions "establish secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs," it sounds like they're setting up some kind of communication channel that's encrypted or at least obscured to avoid detection.

So, between C and D, both seem related to encryption, but T1573.001 is more specific to symmetric cryptography, while T1573 is about encrypted channels in general.

But wait, the question is about establishing a secure communication channel using HTTP GET requests. HTTP can be secured with HTTPS, which uses TLS for encryption, and that would fit under an encrypted channel.

Moreover, the use of specific URLs suggests that they're communicating with certain servers or endpoints in a way that's designed to look normal or blend in with regular traffic.

Also, the mention of multi-beacon communication for evasion suggests that they're using multiple points of communication to make it harder to track or block the malicious activity.

So, in this context, it seems like they're setting up an encrypted channel for their communication, possibly using HTTPS to specific URLs as a command and control mechanism.

Now, looking back at T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter, while it's true that they used PowerShell, which is a scripting interpreter, to download the shellcode, the question is specifically about the step where they establish secure communication.

So, while T1059 is relevant to the initial download of shellcode, it might not be the best fit for the specific action of establishing secure communication.

On the other hand, T1573 - Encrypted Channel seems directly related to setting up a secure, encrypted communication channel, which aligns well with the description in the question.

T1573.001 is a sub-technique of T1573, specifically focusing on symmetric cryptography. While symmetric cryptography could be a method used within the encrypted channel, the question seems to be more about the overall establishment of the secure communication channel rather than the specific type of encryption used.

Therefore, I think the most appropriate choice is T1573 - Encrypted Channel.

To sum it up:

- T1654 is about log enumeration, which isn't directly related to secure communication.

- T1059 is about using command and scripting interpreters, which is relevant to the initial download but not specifically to the secure communication establishment.

- T1573.001 is about symmetric cryptography, which is a specific encryption method.

- T1573 is about encrypted channels in general, which matches the description of establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests.

So, my final answer is D: T1573 - Encrypted Channel.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{D} \]
