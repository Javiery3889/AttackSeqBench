So I've got this question here about TDrop2 and its activities after evading detection and disguising its payload. It says that after doing all that, it then goes on to gather details about the infected system. And we're supposed to pick which MITRE ATT&CK technique best describes this action from the given choices.

First, let's make sure I understand what's happening here. TDrop2 is a type of malware, and it's using some sophisticated methods to avoid being detected by security systems. Specifically, it's using process hollowing and disguising its payload retrieval for defense evasion. Process hollowing is a technique where the malware injects its code into a legitimate process, and disguising payload retrieval likely means it's making its malicious activities look like normal traffic to avoid raising alarms.

Now, after performing these evasion techniques, it wants to gather information about the system it's infected. So, it's probably trying to understand the environment it's in, what resources are available, maybe to decide what to do next or to gather specific data to exfiltrate.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1106 - Native API

B: T1082 - System Information Discovery

C: T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion

D: T1560.002 - Archive via Library

Hmm, let's consider each one.

Starting with A: T1106 - Native API. This technique involves directly interacting with the operating system's native APIs to perform actions. While malware might use native APIs to evade detection or to perform certain tasks, it's a bit broad and not specifically about gathering system information. So, maybe not the best fit here.

Next, B: T1082 - System Information Discovery. This one seems more directly related to gathering information about the system. The description for this technique is "An adversary may attempt to get information about the system, such as the version of the operating system or software running on the system, to help determine vulnerable software or to identify security software that may be present." That sounds exactly like what TDrop2 would want to do after evading detectionâ€”to assess the system it's on.

Option C: T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion. This technique is about avoiding detection by virtualized environments or sandboxes that are set up to analyze malware behavior. While TDrop2 might use this to avoid being analyzed, the question is about what it does after evading detection and disguising its payload, which is to gather system details. So, this seems less relevant to the specific action described.

Lastly, D: T1560.002 - Archive via Library. I'm not entirely familiar with this specific sub-technique, but T1560 generally refers to Archive Collected Data, which is about collecting and archiving data before exfiltration. While gathering system information might be a step before exfiltration, it seems more focused on collecting data rather than discovering system details.

Comparing all these, T1082 - System Information Discovery seems to be the most directly related to the action described in the question. It's specifically about gathering information about the system, which aligns with "gather details about the infected system" mentioned in the question.

Therefore, I think the best answer is B: T1082 - System Information Discovery.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
