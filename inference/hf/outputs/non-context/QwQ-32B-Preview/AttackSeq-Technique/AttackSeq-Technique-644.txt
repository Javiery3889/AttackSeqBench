So I've got this question here about some cyber threat stuff. It says that after spear-phishing emails were used for initial access, I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique best describes how Moafee and DragonOK deploy their tools like custom backdoors and RATs for their campaigns. The answer choices are:

A: T1587.002 - Code Signing Certificates

B: T1588 - Obtain Capabilities

C: T1491.001 - Internal Defacement

D: T1566 - Phishing

First, I need to understand what each of these techniques means according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Starting with A: T1587.002 - Code Signing Certificates. This seems related to using legitimate certificates to sign malicious code, making it appear trustworthy. That could be a way to deploy tools without raising alarms, but I'm not entirely sure if it directly relates to deploying backdoors and RATs.

Next, B: T1588 - Obtain Capabilities. This one sounds interesting. According to MITRE, this technique involves acquiring new tools or capabilities, often by downloading them from a command and control server or other sources. This seems directly related to deploying new tools like backdoors and RATs after initial access.

Option C: T1491.001 - Internal Defacement. This is about modifying internal systems to display messages or alter the user interface, usually for impact or to send a message. That doesn't seem relevant to deploying tools for ongoing campaigns.

Option D: T1566 - Phishing. Well, the question already mentions that spear-phishing was used for initial access, but it's asking about the subsequent deployment of tools. So, while phishing is related, it doesn't describe the deployment activity.

Given these explanations, it seems like T1588 - Obtain Capabilities is the most fitting choice. It directly relates to acquiring and deploying new tools, which aligns with the description of Moafee and DragonOK deploying custom backdoors and RATs.

To double-check, I'll look up the exact descriptions in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.

T1587.002 - Code Signing Certificates: "Adversaries may sign their malware or other files with a legitimate certificate to make them appear trusted by the target system or user."

T1588 - Obtain Capabilities: "Adversaries may obtain capabilities, such as tools or other resources, during their operations."

T1491.001 - Internal Defacement: "Adversaries may deface internal websites or network shares to display messages or alter the user interface."

T1566 - Phishing: "Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems or steal information, such as credentials."

Clearly, T1588 is the most appropriate choice here because it specifically deals with obtaining and using new capabilities, like backdoors and RATs, which is what the question is asking about.

So, my final answer is B: T1588 - Obtain Capabilities.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
