So I've got this question here about ATT&CK techniques, and I need to figure out which one likely happened after the adversaries used reflective code loading to evade defenses. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what reflective code loading is. From what I know, reflective code loading is a technique where malware loads its own code into memory without using standard API calls that would typically be monitored or intercepted by security software. This makes it harder to detect because it bypasses normal loading mechanisms. So, it's a way for attackers to execute their payloads quietly.

Now, the question is asking what likely happened after they used this technique to evade defenses. So, I need to think about what an adversary might do next after successfully executing their code without being detected.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels

B: T1568.003 - DNS Calculation

C: T1556.009 - Conditional Access Policies

D: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application

I need to see which of these techniques makes the most sense to occur after reflective code loading.

Starting with A: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels. This technique involves using multiple stages to perform different parts of an attack, often to make it harder to trace or to avoid detection. Reflective code loading could be part of one of these stages, especially if the first stage is to get the code into memory without being detected, and then subsequent stages carry out other activities. So, this seems plausible.

B: T1568.003 - DNS Calculation. This is a bit more specific. It involves calculating DNS names for command and control servers, possibly to generate domain names that the malware will try to contact. While this could be part of an attack sequence, it's not directly related to code execution, which is what reflective code loading is about. It's more about maintaining persistence or communicating with external servers.

C: T1556.009 - Conditional Access Policies. This seems related to configuring access controls within an organization, perhaps to grant or restrict access to certain resources based on conditions. This doesn't seem directly related to the immediate actions following code execution via reflective loading.

D: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application. This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are accessible from the internet. Again, this seems like it would be an initial entry vector rather than something that happens after code has already been executed via reflective loading.

Given these descriptions, option A: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels seems to be the most logical next step after reflective code loading. The adversaries have executed their code quietly, and now they might proceed to the next stage of their attack plan, which could involve establishing a multi-stage channel for further communication or execution of additional payloads.

Options B, C, and D seem more related to either initial intrusion methods or maintaining persistence, but not directly following the execution of code via reflective loading.

Therefore, my answer is A: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels}} \]
