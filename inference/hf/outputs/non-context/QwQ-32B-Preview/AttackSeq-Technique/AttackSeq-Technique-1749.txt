So I've got this question here about some cyber attack stuff, and I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique best fits what happened during the lateral movement phase. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attackers used PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance. PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts used for penetration testing, and SharpHound is a tool for Active Directory reconnaissance, which helps in mapping the network and finding potential targets. So, they were basically gathering information about the network and its structure.

Next, it says they leveraged compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB. SMB is the Server Message Block protocol, which is used for sharing files and printers between computers. So, with the domain credentials, they could log into other machines and access their shared folders.

Now, the question is asking about the lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network. IIS stands for Internet Information Services, which is Microsoft's platform for running web servers. So, they're moving from one web server to another within the same network.

The answer choices are:

A: T1087.004 - Cloud Account

B: T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information

C: T1021 - Remote Services

D: T1021.007 - Cloud Services

I need to pick the one that best describes the lateral movement technique used in this scenario.

Let's look at each option:

A: T1087.004 - Cloud Account. This seems related to using cloud-based accounts for persistence or command and control, but the question is about moving between servers on the local network, not involving cloud services. So, probably not this one.

B: T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information. This technique is about collecting information about user identities to potentially reuse them for access. While they might have gathered such information earlier, the question is specifically about the lateral movement phase, not the initial reconnaissance.

C: T1021 - Remote Services. This is a broad technique that involves accessing remote systems using built-in or standard network protocols. This seems promising because accessing shared folders over SMB is a way to access remote services.

D: T1021.007 - Cloud Services. Similar to option A, this is about using cloud services for remote access, but again, the scenario is about moving between local servers, not using cloud services.

Given this analysis, option C: T1021 - Remote Services, seems to be the most appropriate choice. The attackers are using remote services, specifically SMB, to access shared folders on other servers, which aligns with the lateral movement between IIS servers.

To confirm, let's look up the MITRE ATT&CK framework to make sure I have the right technique.

Looking up T1021, it is indeed "Remote Services," and it includes the use of protocols like SMB, SSH, RDP, etc., to access other systems remotely. Since the question specifies that they accessed shared folders over SMB, this fits perfectly.

Option D, T1021.007 - Cloud Services, is a specific sub-technique of T1021, but it's focused on cloud-based services, which isn't relevant here.

Options A and B don't directly relate to the lateral movement via SMB that's described in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1021 - Remote Services.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{C: T1021-Remote Services}} \]
