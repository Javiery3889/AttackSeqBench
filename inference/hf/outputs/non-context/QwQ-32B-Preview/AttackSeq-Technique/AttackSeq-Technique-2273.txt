So I've got this question here about the Regin malware and its tactics. It says that Regin utilized encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection, and I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique most likely happened after that.

First, I need to understand what Regin is. From what I know, Regin is a sophisticated malware tool believed to be created by nation-states for cyber espionage. It's known for its complexity and the way it hides its activities on infected systems.

The question mentions that Regin used encrypted data blobs in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection. So, it's hiding its data in places where it's not expected, and encrypting it to make it unreadable even if someone finds it.

Now, I need to look at the answer choices and see which one makes sense as a next step after this data hiding and encryption.

Option A is T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information. This technique involves creating files or information that are difficult to discover or understand. Since Regin is already encrypting data blobs, which is a form of obfuscation, maybe this is a continuation of that tactic to further hide information.

Option B is T1574: Hijack Execution Flow. This seems more related to modifying the execution path of a program to execute malicious code. I'm not sure how directly this relates to the data storage and encryption mentioned.

Option C is T1113: Screen Capture. This is about taking screenshots, which seems quite different from the data storage and encryption activities. Maybe it's a separate action, but I don't see a direct connection.

Option D is T1055.012: Process Hollowing. This is a specific method of executing code within the address space of another process. It's a way to run malicious code under the guise of a legitimate process.

Considering the sequence, after storing encrypted data blobs, what would Regin likely do next? Probably, it would need to access or use that data for its operations. So, it might need to decrypt the data and then perform some action based on it.

Option A, Obfuscated Files or Information, could be part of the same data handling process, but it seems a bit redundant since encryption is already a form of obfuscation.

Option B, Hijack Execution Flow, might be a method to execute its code without being detected, but I'm not sure if it directly follows from data storage activities.

Option C, Screen Capture, seems too specific and not directly related to the data storage and encryption activities.

Option D, Process Hollowing, is a technique used to execute code within a legitimate process, which could be a way for Regin to run its operations without being noticed.

Thinking about it, after storing encrypted data, Regin might need to execute some code to process that data, perhaps to decrypt it or use it for further attacks. Using process hollowing, it could inject its code into a legitimate process, making its activities harder to detect.

Comparing all options, T1055.012 - Process Hollowing seems like the most plausible technique that would occur after the data storage and encryption activities described.

So, my final answer is D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing.
