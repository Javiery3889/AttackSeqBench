So I've got this question here about some cyber attack stuff, and I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique best matches the description. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to save and execute "%Temp%/Rdws.exe". I know that CVEs are Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, which are like known weaknesses in software that hackers can exploit to do bad things. So, someone found a vulnerability in the system, specifically CVE-2015-5119, and used it to drop and run this Rdws.exe file in the temporary folder.

Then, it says that Rdws.exe retrieved a second-stage PlugX file. PlugX is a type of malware that's used for remote access and control of infected systems. It's often used by attackers for various malicious activities. So, the first executable downloaded and ran another piece of malware, which is probably more powerful or has more features.

Now, the question is asking about which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated its communication with C2 domains, specifically mentioning "inocnation[.]com". C2 stands for Command and Control, which is how malware communicates back to the attackers to receive instructions or exfiltrate data.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1001.002 - Steganography

B: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol

C: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise

D: T1005 - Data from Local System

I need to think about which of these techniques would be used for communicating with a C2 server.

Let's look at each one:

A: T1001.002 - Steganography is hiding data within innocent-looking files, like images or documents, to avoid detection. While it's a way to hide data, it's not directly related to communicating with a C2 server.

B: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol refers to using standard application layer protocols, like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc., for command and control communications. This seems very relevant because malware often uses these protocols to communicate with their C2 servers in a way that blends in with normal traffic.

C: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise is when a victim visits a website that has malicious code, which then exploits vulnerabilities in their browser or other software to install malware. This seems more related to the initial infection vector rather than the communication with C2 servers.

D: T1005 - Data from Local System is about collecting data from the local system, not about communicating outward to a C2 server.

Given this, it seems like T1071 - Application Layer Protocol is the most directly related to facilitating communication with C2 domains.

But let's think a bit more. Maybe there's a reason to choose another one.

Steganography could be used to hide the communication, but it's not the primary method for communicating; it's more for hiding the data within other data.

Drive-by compromise is about the initial infection, which is already mentioned in the question as exploiting CVE-2015-5119.

Data from local system is about collecting data, not communicating it out.

So, again, T1071 seems the most fitting.

Moreover, the question mentions that the second-stage malware communicated with C2 domains like "inocnation[.]com". Using standard application layer protocols would allow the malware to communicate with these domains in a way that looks normal and avoids raising alarms.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is B: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
