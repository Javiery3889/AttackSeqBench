So I've got this question here about some cyber attack that happened through a compromised website, and I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique probably happened next after they used a zero-day vulnerability during the initial access. Let's break this down.

First, let's understand what's being asked. There was an initial access campaign where attackers targeted users through a compromised website of the Veteran of Foreign Wars. They used a zero-day vulnerability, which means it's a previously unknown vulnerability that the attackers exploited before anyone else knew about it. So, the attack started with exploiting this vulnerability on the website.

Now, I need to think about what likely happened next, based on the answer choices provided. The answer choices are:

A: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol

B: T1199 - Trusted Relationship

C: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise

D: T1608.001 - Upload Malware

I need to evaluate which one of these techniques is most plausible to have occurred after the initial access through the zero-day vulnerability.

Let's look at each one:

A: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using protocols at the application layer of the OSI model for command and control or data exfiltration. While this might be used later in an attack, it's not directly related to the initial access through a compromised website.

B: T1199 - Trusted Relationship: This technique involves exploiting a pre-existing trusted relationship, such as compromising a supplier or partner's system to gain access to the target organization. While possible, it doesn't directly relate to the initial access through a website vulnerability.

C: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves compromising a victim's machine by exploiting vulnerabilities in software through a website visit, often without the user's knowledge. This seems very relevant because the initial access was through a compromised website, and a drive-by compromise is a common method for exploiting vulnerabilities in this scenario.

D: T1608.001 - Upload Malware: This technique involves uploading malware to a target system. While this might happen after gaining initial access, it's more of an action taken after access is gained, not necessarily the immediate next step after exploiting the vulnerability on the website.

Considering the sequence, the attack started with exploiting a zero-day vulnerability on the compromised website during an initial access campaign. The most likely next step would be to compromise the victim's machine as they visit the website, which aligns with a drive-by compromise.

Let me think about this again. The attackers targeted users through the compromised website using a zero-day vulnerability. So, when a user visits the website, their browser or another piece of software is exploited due to this vulnerability. The next logical step would be that the attacker compromises the user's machine through this exploit, which is exactly what a drive-by compromise entails.

Option A, Application Layer Protocol, might be used later for maintaining access or exfiltrating data, but it's not directly related to the initial compromise through the website.

Option B, Trusted Relationship, seems more related to supply chain attacks or similar scenarios where there's a pre-existing trust between entities, which doesn't directly relate to the initial access through a website vulnerability.

Option D, Upload Malware, could be a part of the compromise, but it's more of an action taken after gaining access, not the method of initial access.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that after exploiting the zero-day vulnerability on the website, the attackers performed a drive-by compromise to gain access to the victim's system.

So, the answer should be C: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise.

Wait a minute, let's double-check. Is there any chance that upload malware could be the immediate next step? Maybe, but upload malware suggests that the attackers are uploading malware to the target system after they've gained some level of access. However, in a drive-by compromise, the exploitation happens as the user visits the website, and the malware is likely delivered and executed as part of that visit.

Therefore, the drive-by compromise (T1189) is the technique that directly follows the exploitation of the zero-day vulnerability on the website to gain initial access to the victim's system.

Hence, the correct answer is C: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{C: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise}} \]
