So I've got this question here about the Darkhotel APT and their tactics. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Darkhotel used advanced reconnaissance to identify victims' locations and stay details. That sounds like they were doing some serious spying to get specific information about their targets. So, they knew where their victims were staying, probably hotels, hence the name "Darkhotel."

Now, the question is asking about the next step: how they maintained a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources. So, they needed a way to control their operations across different locations and possibly different compromised systems.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1608.001 - Upload Malware

B: T1573 - Encrypted Channel

C: T1584.002 - DNS Server

D: T1584 - Compromise Infrastructure

I need to think about which one of these best enables them to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

Let's consider each one:

A: Upload Malware - This seems more related to delivering malicious software to a target system. While it's certainly a part of an APT's toolkit, it doesn't directly relate to maintaining a network infrastructure.

B: Encrypted Channel - This is about establishing a secure communication channel to avoid detection and to ensure that their communications aren't intercepted or tampered with. While important for secrecy, it doesn't directly address the maintenance of a global network infrastructure.

C: DNS Server - DNS is the system that translates domain names into IP addresses. Compromising a DNS server could allow them to redirect traffic or set up their own domains for their infrastructure. This seems relevant to maintaining a network infrastructure.

D: Compromise Infrastructure - This is a bit broader and seems to cover the idea of taking over existing infrastructure for their own use. This could include servers, networks, etc.

Given that the question mentions "compromised commercial resources," it sounds like they are taking over existing commercial infrastructure for their operations.

Between C and D, C is more specific to DNS servers, while D is broader, covering any kind of infrastructure compromise.

But the question is about maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure. Compromising a DNS server could be one way to achieve that, as DNS is crucial for directing traffic across the internet.

However, compromising infrastructure could include much more, like servers, routers, etc.

Wait, but the sub-technique T1584.002 specifically mentions DNS server, which is a part of the broader T1584 Compromise Infrastructure.

Given that DNS servers are critical for managing domain names and IP addresses, compromising them could allow Darkhotel to set up dynamic and flexible infrastructure, as they could change IP mappings easily to adapt their network as needed.

Also, considering that the attack sequence involves advanced reconnaissance to identify victims' locations, they might need a way to dynamically adjust their infrastructure based on where their targets are.

So, compromising DNS servers could give them the ability to redirect traffic to different servers based on geographic location or other factors, which aligns with maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

On the other hand, compromising other types of infrastructure, like web servers or mail servers, might not provide the same level of control over directing network traffic.

Therefore, I think T1584.002 - DNS Server is the most plausible technique that enabled Darkhotel to maintain their global and dynamic network infrastructure.

But let's double-check the other options to be sure.

Option A, Upload Malware, is about placing malware onto systems. While this is likely part of their overall strategy, it doesn't directly relate to maintaining a network infrastructure.

Option B, Encrypted Channel, is about securing communications, which is important but again, doesn't directly address the infrastructure maintenance.

So, while all these techniques could be part of their overall toolkit, in the context of maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure, compromising DNS servers seems the most directly relevant.

Therefore, my final answer is C: T1584.002 - DNS Server.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{C: T1584.002 - DNS Server}} \]
