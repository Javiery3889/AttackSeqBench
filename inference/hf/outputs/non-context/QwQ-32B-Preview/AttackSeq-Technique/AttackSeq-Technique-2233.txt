So I've got this question here about malware and persistence techniques. Let me try to understand it step by step. The scenario is that there's this malware called Grabit, and it uses a malicious macro to send an HTTP request to a compromised server to download itself. Then, the question is asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to maintain persistence on the infected system after that.

First, I need to make sure I understand what "persistence" means in the context of malware. Persistence refers to the methods malware uses to ensure it starts up automatically every time the system boots or the user logs in, so the attacker can maintain access over time.

Okay, so the answer choices are:

A: T1008 - Fallback Channels

B: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

C: T1546.011 - Application Shimming

D: T1546.001 - Change Default File Association

Let me look at each one and see which one makes the most sense for maintaining persistence.

Starting with A: T1008 - Fallback Channels. This seems like it's about establishing alternative communication methods if the primary one is disrupted. But persistence is more about ensuring the malware runs again after a reboot, not necessarily about maintaining a communication channel. So, maybe not the best fit here.

Next, B: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution. This sounds directly related to persistence because it's about configuring the system to run certain programs or scripts during startup or when the user logs in. That's exactly what persistence is about. So, this seems like a strong candidate.

Now, C: T1546.011 - Application Shimming. I'm not super familiar with this one, but from what I recall, shimming involves modifying the way applications run, often to support older software on newer systems. It's not immediately obvious how this would be used for persistence, so I'll keep it on the back burner for now.

And D: T1546.001 - Change Default File Association. This seems like it's about changing which programs handle certain file types. For example, changing the default program to open .doc files. While this could be used for malicious purposes, it's not directly related to ensuring the malware runs at startup or logon.

Comparing all these, T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution seems to be the most directly related to persistence. The other options seem more related to initial access or execution, but not specifically to maintaining long-term access through system restarts or user logons.

Therefore, I think the answer is B: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
