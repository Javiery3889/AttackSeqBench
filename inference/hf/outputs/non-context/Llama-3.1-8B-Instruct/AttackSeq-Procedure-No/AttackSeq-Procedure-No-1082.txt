Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Poison Ivy server, which is a remote access Trojan (RAT) used for malicious purposes.
- The question states that the malware is delivered via social engineering methods, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick victims into executing malicious code.
- The question asks about the likelihood of the malware using Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications during the C2 phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Poison Ivy is a RAT that can be used for various malicious activities, including C2 communications.
- Google Drive is a cloud storage service that can be used for legitimate purposes, but it can also be used by attackers as a C2 channel due to its widespread use and ease of access.
- However, using Google Drive for C2 communications is not a typical behavior associated with Poison Ivy, as it is more commonly associated with other C2 channels such as HTTP, HTTPS, or custom protocols.

Given the information above, the most plausible answer is that it is unlikely for Poison Ivy to use Google Drive for C2 communications.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Poison Ivy is a RAT that can be used for various malicious activities.
2. Google Drive is a cloud storage service that can be used for legitimate purposes, but it can also be used by attackers as a C2 channel.
3. However, Poison Ivy is not typically associated with using Google Drive for C2 communications.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that Poison Ivy will use Google Drive for C2 communications.

Final Answer: B
