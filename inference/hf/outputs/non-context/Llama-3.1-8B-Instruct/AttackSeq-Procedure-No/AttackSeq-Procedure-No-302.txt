Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the IEXPL0RE RAT, which is a type of malware that records keystrokes and exfiltrates data.
- The question asks if it is likely to use blogs and WordPress for C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure instead of encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Typically, malware like IEXPL0RE RAT uses encrypted communication methods to avoid detection and maintain stealth.
- Using blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure is not a typical method for malware communication, as it is more commonly associated with legitimate purposes and may raise suspicions.
- Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are more common for C2 communication due to their ability to evade detection and maintain anonymity.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Malware like IEXPL0RE RAT typically uses encrypted communication methods to maintain stealth.
2. Using blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure is not a typical method for malware communication.
3. Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are more common for C2 communication.

Final Answer: B
