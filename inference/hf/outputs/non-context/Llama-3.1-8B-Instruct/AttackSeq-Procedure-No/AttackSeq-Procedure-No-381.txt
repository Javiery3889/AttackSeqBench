Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving APT15, a known threat actor, and mentions the use of stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials for initial access.
- The question asks if APT15 is likely to deploy specific tools (RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS) for execution evasion and command execution before using Mimikatz for OS credential dumping.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- APT15 is known for its sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). 
- RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS are tools that can be used for execution evasion and command execution, respectively.
- Mimikatz is a tool used for OS credential dumping.

Given APT15's known TTPs, it is plausible that they would use tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution, respectively, as part of their attack sequence. Mimikatz is also a tool commonly used by APT15 for OS credential dumping.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT15 gains initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials.
2. To maintain persistence and execute further actions, APT15 would likely use tools like RoyalCLI for execution evasion to avoid detection.
3. After establishing a foothold, APT15 would use RoyalDNS for command execution to execute additional malicious activities.
4. Finally, APT15 would use Mimikatz to dump OS credentials, allowing them to escalate privileges and move laterally within the network.

Final Answer: A
