Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by the Aurora malware:
  1. Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
  2. Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The described TTPs are related to evasion techniques, specifically:
  - TTP 1: File Time Manipulation (TA0005) - This is a technique used to evade detection by modifying the file timestamps to make the malware appear as if it was created or modified at a different time.
  - TTP 2: Process Hollowing (T1036) - This is a technique used to evade detection by loading the malware into a legitimate process (in this case, svchost.exe) to make it appear as if the malware is a legitimate process.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- The question asks if the malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for Command and Control (C2).
- The described TTPs are related to evasion and process manipulation, but there is no information about the communication protocol used for C2.

However, based on the knowledge of the Aurora malware, it is known to use the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Aurora malware, specifically evasion techniques.
2. The described TTPs do not provide information about the C2 communication protocol used by the malware.
3. However, based on the knowledge of the Aurora malware, it is known to use the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.

Final Answer: A
