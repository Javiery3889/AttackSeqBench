Analyzing the Question: 
- The question describes the SideWinder APT group exploiting CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play.
- The question asks if it is likely that the group installed loadable kernel modules on infected machines for privilege escalation before employing techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a sequence of TTPs: 
  1. Initial access via exploitation of CVE-2019-2215.
  2. Privilege escalation.
  3. Evasion techniques (obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation).

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes. This answer choice suggests that the group would install loadable kernel modules for privilege escalation before employing evasion techniques. This sequence aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors, who often use privilege escalation techniques to gain higher-level access before attempting to evade detection.
- B: No. This answer choice suggests that the group would employ evasion techniques before privilege escalation, which is less likely given the typical behavior of advanced threat actors.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The SideWinder APT group exploited CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access, which is a common tactic used by threat actors to gain a foothold in a system.
2. To escalate privileges, the group would likely use techniques that allow them to gain higher-level access, such as installing loadable kernel modules.
3. After gaining higher-level access, the group would employ evasion techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to avoid detection by security software.

Final Answer: A
