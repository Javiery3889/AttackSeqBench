Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by the StellarParticle campaign.
- The sequence includes:
  1. Using web session cookies in credential access techniques to access cloud resources.
  2. Stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations.
  3. Utilizing credential hopping.
  4. Configuring malware such as TrailBlazer for WMI persistence.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware such as TrailBlazer for WMI persistence.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question implies that the campaign will first access cloud resources using web session cookies, then use credential hopping, and finally configure malware for persistence.
- Stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations is mentioned as a separate step after the other two steps.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice suggests that the campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for persistence, which aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- B: No - This choice suggests that the campaign will not steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for persistence, which contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the StellarParticle campaign.
2. The sequence includes accessing cloud resources using web session cookies, credential hopping, and configuring malware for persistence.
3. Stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations is mentioned as a separate step after the other two steps.
4. The correct answer should align with this sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: A
