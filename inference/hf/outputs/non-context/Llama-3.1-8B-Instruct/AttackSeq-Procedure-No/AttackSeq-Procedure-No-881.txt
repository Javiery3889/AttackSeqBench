Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Aria-body backdoor, which is likely a malware or a tool used for malicious activities.
- The question describes the Collection phase, where the backdoor engages in various activities such as creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and data collection.
- The question asks if the backdoor is likely to gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase only afterward.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Collection phase typically involves gathering information from the compromised system, which includes data that can be used to identify the system, such as hostname and public IP.
- The Discovery phase, on the other hand, is about identifying and gathering information about the target environment, which can include system information, network information, and other details.
- Given the nature of the Collection phase, it is likely that the backdoor has already gathered the necessary information, including system information, hostname, and public IP, before moving to the Discovery phase.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Collection phase involves data collection activities, which likely include gathering system information, hostname, and public IP.
2. The Discovery phase is about identifying and gathering information about the target environment.
3. It is unlikely that the backdoor would wait until the Discovery phase to gather information that it has already collected during the Collection phase.

Final Answer: B
