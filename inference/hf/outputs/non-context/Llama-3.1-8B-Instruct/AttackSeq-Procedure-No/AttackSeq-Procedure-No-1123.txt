Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to gain initial access by exploiting CVE-2015-5119.
- The attack involves a Flash file named 'show.swf' and a GIF image.
- The question asks if the Flash file will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a multi-stage attack where the initial exploit (CVE-2015-5119) gains initial access, and then the shellcode is executed.
- The shellcode is then expected to install a payload, which is embedded in a GIF image.
- Defense Evasion is a tactic that involves techniques used to evade detection by security products or defenders.
- Typically, Defense Evasion techniques are used after initial access has been gained to prevent detection of the next stages of the attack.

Given this context, it is likely that the shellcode would execute Defense Evasion techniques after installing the payload to prevent detection of the payload. Therefore, the shellcode would execute Defense Evasion techniques after installing the payload, not before.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial access is gained through the spear-phishing attack using the Adobe Flash exploit.
2. The shellcode is executed after the initial access is gained.
3. The shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.
4. To prevent detection of the payload, Defense Evasion techniques are executed after the payload is installed.

Final Answer: B
