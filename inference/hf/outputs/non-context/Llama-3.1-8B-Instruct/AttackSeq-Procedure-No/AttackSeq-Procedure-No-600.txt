Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Sednit group, which is known to be a threat actor group.
- It mentions the use of malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access, which is a common tactic used by the Sednit group.
- The question asks if the group will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning related to government and critical infrastructure organizations during the Discovery phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Sednit group is known for its targeted attacks, often focusing on government and critical infrastructure organizations.
- The use of VBA macros to establish initial access is consistent with the group's tactics.
- The Discovery phase is a part of the attack lifecycle where the threat actor gathers information about the target environment.
- Vulnerability scanning is a common technique used during the Discovery phase to identify potential entry points.

Given the Sednit group's tactics and the context of the question, it is plausible that they would use vulnerability scanning to gather information about the target environment after establishing initial access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Sednit group is known for targeting government and critical infrastructure organizations.
2. They use VBA macros to establish initial access, which is consistent with their tactics.
3. The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the target environment.
4. Vulnerability scanning is a common technique used during the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: A
