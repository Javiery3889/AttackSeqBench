Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions 'stopedge.bat' deleting files 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as a means of defense evasion.
- It asks if it is likely that persistence will be established by using kernel modules similar to those employed by Drovorub or Skidmap.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Defense evasion is a tactic used to avoid detection by security software or other means.
- The deletion of files 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' suggests that the attacker is trying to remove indicators of their presence or tools used for further actions.
- Persistence is a tactic used to maintain access to a system after initial access has been gained.
- Kernel modules like those used by Drovorub or Skidmap are typically used for persistence, as they can load malicious code into the kernel, making it difficult to remove.

Given the context, the deletion of files as a defense evasion technique does not necessarily imply the use of kernel modules for persistence. In fact, the two are distinct tactics, and the use of one does not necessarily lead to the use of the other. 

Therefore, the most plausible answer is that persistence will not be established by using kernel modules similar to those employed by Drovorub or Skidmap.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions defense evasion, which is a tactic used to avoid detection.
2. The deletion of files 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' is an example of defense evasion.
3. Persistence is a separate tactic used to maintain access to a system.
4. Kernel modules like those used by Drovorub or Skidmap are used for persistence, not defense evasion.
5. Therefore, the deletion of files as a defense evasion technique does not imply the use of kernel modules for persistence.

Final Answer: B
