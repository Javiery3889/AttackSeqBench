Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions PyFlash backdoor gathering OS-related information and sending it to the C&C server.
- It asks if NetFlash and PyFlash will use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers using Asymmetric Cryptography.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- PyFlash is a backdoor, which is a type of malware that allows unauthorized access to a system. 
- Typically, backdoors use encryption to communicate with their C&C servers to avoid detection.
- HTTPS is a protocol that uses Asymmetric Cryptography (public-key cryptography) for secure communication.
- However, backdoors often use symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) for efficiency and speed, rather than asymmetric encryption (HTTPS) which is typically used for secure web communication.

Given the nature of backdoors, it is unlikely that PyFlash and NetFlash would use HTTPS for communication with their C&C servers, as it would be less efficient and more resource-intensive than symmetric encryption.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Backdoors like PyFlash typically use encryption for communication with C&C servers.
2. HTTPS uses Asymmetric Cryptography, which is not the typical choice for backdoors.
3. Symmetric encryption is more commonly used in backdoors for efficiency and speed.

Final Answer: B
