Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker:
  1. Execution (using SparrowDoor via cmd.exe)
  2. Command and Control (communicating with a C&C server via HTTPS)

Comparing and Evaluating:
- To determine the Initial Access TTP, we need to look for the first step in the attack sequence.
- The question mentions Execution and Command and Control, but it does not explicitly state the Initial Access method.
- However, it mentions SparrowDoor, which is a malware known to be used for various malicious activities, including exploitation of vulnerabilities.

Given the information, it is likely that the Initial Access was achieved through exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications, as SparrowDoor is often used after such an initial compromise.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the Execution and Command and Control phases, but the Initial Access is not explicitly mentioned.
2. SparrowDoor is a malware that can be used after an initial compromise, often through exploitation of vulnerabilities.
3. Given the context, it is plausible that the Initial Access was achieved through exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.

Final Answer: A
