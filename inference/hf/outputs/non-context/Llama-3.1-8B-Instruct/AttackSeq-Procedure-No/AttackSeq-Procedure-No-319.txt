Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a phishing campaign by TA453, where an actor-controlled Gmail account impersonated a prominent Israeli physicist.
- The question asks if it is likely that the phishing emails included a link leading to the TA453-controlled domain after presenting a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.

Comparing and Evaluating:
