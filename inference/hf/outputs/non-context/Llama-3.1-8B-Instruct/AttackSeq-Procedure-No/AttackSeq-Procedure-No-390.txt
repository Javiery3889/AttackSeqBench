Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the use of AtomBombing, a technique used for malicious code injection, to execute code via legitimate programs on a Windows operating system.
- The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will use a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) script, specifically embedding it within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- AtomBombing is a technique used to inject malicious code into legitimate processes on a Windows system. This is often used to bypass security controls and execute malicious code without being detected.
- VBA scripts are commonly used in Microsoft Office applications, such as Word, to automate tasks or interact with the application. However, they can also be used to deliver malware or execute malicious code when a document is opened.
- Embedding a VBA script within a malicious Word document is a common tactic used by threat actors to deliver malware or execute malicious code on a victim's system. This tactic is often used in phishing attacks, where the victim is tricked into opening the malicious document.

Given the information above, it is likely that threat actors who use AtomBombing to execute malicious code via legitimate programs would also use a VBA script, such as embedding it within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Threat actors use AtomBombing to inject malicious code into legitimate processes on a Windows system.
2. VBA scripts can be used to deliver malware or execute malicious code when a document is opened.
3. Embedding a VBA script within a malicious Word document is a common tactic used by threat actors to execute malicious code on a victim's system.
4. Therefore, it is likely that threat actors who use AtomBombing would also use a VBA script, such as embedding it within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

Final Answer: A
