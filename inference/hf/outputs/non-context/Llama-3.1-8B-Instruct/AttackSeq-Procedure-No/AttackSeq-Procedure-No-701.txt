Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving spear-phishing emails as the primary attack vector to gain initial access.
- The question asks if the attackers, Moafee and DragonOK, will utilize custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development only after using environment-based evasion techniques.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Spear-phishing emails are often used to deliver initial payloads, which can be designed to execute immediately or wait for a specific condition to be met.
- Environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, are commonly used to ensure that the payload is executed on a specific environment or system configuration.
- Custom-built backdoors and RATs are typically used for maintaining persistence and control over the compromised system.

Given this information, it is plausible that Moafee and DragonOK would use environment-based evasion techniques to ensure their payloads are executed on the correct system before deploying custom-built backdoors and RATs for resource development.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails.
2. The attackers need to ensure their payloads are executed on the correct system, which is achieved through environment-based evasion techniques.
3. Once the payloads are executed, custom-built backdoors and RATs are deployed for resource development.

Final Answer: A
