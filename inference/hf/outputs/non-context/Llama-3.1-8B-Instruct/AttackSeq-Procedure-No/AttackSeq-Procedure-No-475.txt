Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Infamous Chisel malware, which replaces the legitimate netd service.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Chisel is a tool used for bypassing network restrictions, primarily for accessing blocked websites and services. It is not typically associated with file exfiltration or using Tor hidden services and SSH connections for this purpose.
- Chisel's primary function is to create a tunnel, not to exfiltrate data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Chisel's primary function is to bypass network restrictions, not to exfiltrate files.
2. The question mentions the use of a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration, which is not a typical behavior of Chisel.
3. Given Chisel's purpose and typical behavior, it is unlikely that it would automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Final Answer: B
