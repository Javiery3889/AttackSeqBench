Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions APT-TOCS (a known threat group) exhibiting lateral movement through network projection within the internal network. This implies that the threat actor has already gained initial access and is now moving laterally within the network.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Lateral movement typically involves the use of techniques such as Remote Services (T1210) or Valid Accounts (T1078) to move within the network. 
- Once inside the network, the threat actor may use various methods for command and control (C2) operations, such as using the network itself (e.g., T1071 - Application Layer Protocol) or removable media (e.g., T1021 - Remote Services).

Considering the given options:
- Option A: Yes - This choice suggests that APT-TOCS would use removable media for C2 operations after exhibiting lateral movement. This is plausible because, after gaining access and moving laterally, a threat actor might use removable media to maintain persistence or communicate with their C2 server, especially if they have already compromised internal systems and are trying to avoid detection.
- Option B: No - This choice implies that APT-TOCS would not use removable media for C2 operations after exhibiting lateral movement. While this is possible, it is less likely because, after gaining access and moving laterally, a threat actor might still use removable media to maintain persistence or communicate with their C2 server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT-TOCS has already exhibited lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.
2. This implies that the threat actor has already gained initial access and is now moving within the network.
3. After gaining access and moving laterally, a threat actor might use various methods for C2 operations, including removable media.
4. Given the context, using removable media for C2 operations is a plausible next step for APT-TOCS.

Final Answer: A
