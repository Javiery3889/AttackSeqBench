Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the malware using HTTPS communication for command and control (C2) operations.
- It asks if the malware will discover system information and process lists via a specific command.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The use of HTTPS for C2 operations suggests that the malware is likely to be a sophisticated threat actor, possibly using a more advanced TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure).
- The command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' is a Windows command that retrieves system information and process lists. This command is typically used for reconnaissance and information gathering.
- Given the HTTPS C2 communication, it's plausible that the malware would use this command to gather system information and process lists, as it would be a common step in the attack sequence for an advanced threat actor.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The malware uses HTTPS for C2 operations, indicating a sophisticated threat actor.
2. The command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' is used for reconnaissance and information gathering.
3. Given the sophistication of the threat actor, it's likely they would use this command to gather system information and process lists.

Final Answer: A
