Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker, "FamousSparrow."
- The sequence involves:
  1. Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
  2. Retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory during the Discovery phase.
  3. Reading file contents.
  4. Exfiltrating the contents to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the sequence of TTPs is likely to include retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory before reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
- The sequence described in the question is a logical progression of actions that an attacker might take to gather information and exfiltrate data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker first dumps credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz, which is a technique used for Credential Access.
2. After gaining access to credentials, the attacker would likely want to gather more information about the system to identify potential targets for data exfiltration.
3. Retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory would be a natural next step in the Discovery phase, as it would provide the attacker with information about the system's file structure and potential data sources.
4. Once the attacker has identified potential targets, they would likely read the file contents to gather sensitive information.
5. Finally, the attacker would exfiltrate the contents to the C&C server for further analysis or malicious purposes.

Based on this logical progression of actions, it is likely that the sequence of TTPs would include retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory before reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.

Final Answer: A
