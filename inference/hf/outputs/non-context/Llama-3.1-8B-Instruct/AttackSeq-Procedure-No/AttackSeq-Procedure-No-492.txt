Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions a custom screenshot tool used by Harvester, which captures and archives screenshots for collection.
- It also mentions the use of a custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon) and Cobalt Strike Beacon.
- The question asks if it is likely that these tools will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is an outdated protocol that is not commonly used for C2 communication in modern attacks.
- Custom backdoors and Cobalt Strike Beacons typically use more modern and secure protocols for C2 communication, such as HTTPS, DNS tunneling, or even custom protocols.
- The use of FTP for C2 communication would be unusual and less likely in a sophisticated attack.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions a custom screenshot tool, which suggests a sophisticated attacker.
2. The use of a custom backdoor and Cobalt Strike Beacon indicates a high level of sophistication and planning.
3. Given the sophistication of the attacker, it is unlikely they would use an outdated protocol like FTP for C2 communication.
4. Modern attackers prefer more secure and stealthy communication methods.

Final Answer: B
