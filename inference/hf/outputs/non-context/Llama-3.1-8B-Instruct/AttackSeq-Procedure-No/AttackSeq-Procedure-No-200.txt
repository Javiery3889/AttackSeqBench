Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by the GreyEnergy group:
  1. Compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini.
  2. Using Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.
- PDQ Deploy is a legitimate tool used for software deployment, but it can also be used for malicious purposes, such as lateral movement in a network.
- AvosLocker is a ransomware variant that can be distributed through various means, including lateral movement within a network.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice suggests that the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network, which is a plausible scenario given the group's use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
- B: No - This choice suggests that the GreyEnergy group will not use PDQ Deploy for this purpose, which is less likely given the group's demonstrated use of legitimate tools for malicious activities.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The GreyEnergy group has already compromised a computer using GreyEnergy mini, indicating their ability to use sophisticated tools for malicious purposes.
2. They have used Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials, showing their interest in lateral movement and credential access.
3. Given their use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes, it is plausible that they would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.

Final Answer: A
