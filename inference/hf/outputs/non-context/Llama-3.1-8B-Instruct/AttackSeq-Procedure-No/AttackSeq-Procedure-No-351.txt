Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving an initial access through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file.
- The downloader file is identified as MSIL/Crimson malware.
- The question asks if the malware will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component from a specific IP address.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question describes a specific attack sequence involving a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) and a known malware (MSIL/Crimson).
- The question asks about the behavior of the malware after initial access, specifically about establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.
- The question also mentions the malware attempting to download a full RAT component from a specific IP address.

Given the information, we can infer that the question is asking about the typical behavior of the MSIL/Crimson malware after initial access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158, which is a known vulnerability that can be exploited to drop a downloader file.
2. The downloader file is identified as MSIL/Crimson malware, which is known to be a type of malware that can establish command and control communication using a custom protocol.
3. The question asks about the behavior of the malware after initial access, which suggests that the malware will likely follow its typical behavior after being executed on the victim's machine.
4. Given the known behavior of MSIL/Crimson malware, it is likely that it will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol before attempting to download the full RAT component.

Final Answer: A
