Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an initial access vector through misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
- The question asks if adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that the initial access has already been gained through the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.
- The use of DOCKERGEDDON suggests that the adversaries are using a tool to scan or detect Docker APIs, which is a reconnaissance activity.
- Deploying malicious containers would be an action taken after initial access has been gained, and reconnaissance would likely occur before or concurrently with this action.

Given this analysis, it is unlikely that adversaries would detect compromised Docker APIs using DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers. This would imply that the detection occurs after the malicious activity has already been initiated.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access is gained through misconfigured Docker API ports.
2. Adversaries use DOCKERGEDDON to detect compromised Docker APIs, which is a reconnaissance activity.
3. Deploying malicious containers would be an action taken after initial access has been gained.

Final Answer: B
