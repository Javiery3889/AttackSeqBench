Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware, Machete, which includes:
  1. Enumerating running processes
  2. Gathering browser data (bookmarks and stored credentials)

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the malware will collect files by copying them from local systems and removable media before targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores.

Considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the described sequence of TTPs suggests that Machete is likely engaging in reconnaissance and information gathering activities. The enumeration of running processes and gathering of browser data indicate that the malware is trying to gather information about the system and the user's activities.

The next step in the sequence, collecting files by copying them from local systems and removable media, is a common technique used in data exfiltration and lateral movement. This is often seen in the "Collection" tactic of the ATT&CK framework, where the adversary collects data from the compromised system.

Targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores is also a common technique used in the "Credential Access" tactic, which is a part of the "Lateral Movement" or "Execution" tactics in the ATT&CK framework.

Given this analysis, it is likely that the malware will collect files by copying them from local systems and removable media before targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores.
