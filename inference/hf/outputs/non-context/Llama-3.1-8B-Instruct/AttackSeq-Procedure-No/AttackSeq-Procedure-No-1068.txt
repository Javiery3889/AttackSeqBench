Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Yellow Garuda, a threat actor, collecting data from victims' Telegram accounts using the 'grabber' tool.
- The data collected includes messages, media, group memberships, and contact data.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that the collected data is then exfiltrated, which suggests a potential evasion technique to avoid detection.
- Dividing data into fixed-size chunks is a common technique used in data exfiltration to evade detection, as it can make the exfiltrated data less suspicious and harder to detect by security systems.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions Yellow Garuda using a 'grabber' tool to collect data, which implies a need to exfiltrate the data.
2. The data collected includes various types of information, which could be sensitive and valuable to the attacker.
3. Exfiltrating data in fixed-size chunks is a common technique used to evade detection, as it can make the exfiltrated data less suspicious and harder to detect by security systems.

Final Answer: A
