Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by the Carbanak group, a notorious cybercrime gang.
- The sequence involves compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator, using those credentials to compromise additional endpoints, and then using a Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Compromising a Domain Administrator's credentials would grant the attackers a high level of privilege within the network, allowing them to move laterally and access sensitive areas.
- Using those credentials to compromise additional endpoints would be a natural next step, as the attackers would seek to expand their foothold within the network.
- Utilizing a Cobalt Strike beacon to map the network and collect administrative-level credentials would be a logical continuation of the attack, as the attackers would seek to gather more information about the network and its defenses to further their goals.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Compromising a Domain Administrator's credentials would provide the attackers with a high level of access and control within the network.
2. Using those credentials to compromise additional endpoints would be a natural next step, allowing the attackers to expand their presence within the network.
3. Utilizing a Cobalt Strike beacon to map the network and collect administrative-level credentials would be a logical continuation of the attack, as the attackers would seek to gather more information about the network and its defenses.

Final Answer: A
