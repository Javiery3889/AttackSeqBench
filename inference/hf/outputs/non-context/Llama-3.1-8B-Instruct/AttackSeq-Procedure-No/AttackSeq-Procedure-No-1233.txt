Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions APT28, a known threat actor, deploying additional modules (pr.dll) to upload stolen data to a Command and Control (C&C) server.
- The question asks if APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only afterward.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- APT28 is known for its sophisticated and multi-stage attack campaigns. 
- Typically, APT28 starts with initial access and exploitation, then moves to lateral movement and discovery to identify vulnerable systems.
- Deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to a C&C server suggests that the initial access and exploitation phase is already complete, and the focus is now on exfiltration.
- Geographically distributed bots are often used for reconnaissance and initial access, not typically for discovery after the initial access has been established.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT28's typical attack sequence involves initial access and exploitation, followed by lateral movement and discovery.
2. The deployment of pr.dll suggests that the initial access and exploitation phase is complete, and the focus is now on exfiltration.
3. Geographically distributed bots are more commonly used for initial access and reconnaissance, not for discovery after the initial access has been established.

Final Answer: B
