Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Regin, which is a known malware family, and its potential actions during the discovery phase of an attack.
- The question specifically asks if Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its modular design and ability to perform various functions, including data collection and exfiltration.
- During the discovery phase, attackers often use various techniques to gather information about the target environment.
- Gathering information on processes and memory utilization can help attackers understand the system's current state and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Scanning for deleted files can aid in uncovering sensitive information that may have been previously deleted but not securely erased.

Given Regin's capabilities and the typical actions taken during the discovery phase, it is plausible that Regin would engage in these activities.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its data collection capabilities.
2. During the discovery phase, attackers often gather information about the target environment.
3. Gathering information on processes and memory utilization is a common tactic to understand the system's current state.
4. Scanning for deleted files can aid in uncovering sensitive information.
5. Based on Regin's capabilities and typical discovery phase activities, it is likely to engage in these actions.

Final Answer: A
