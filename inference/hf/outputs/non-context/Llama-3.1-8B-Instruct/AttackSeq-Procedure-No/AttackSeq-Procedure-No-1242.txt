Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions APT28, a known threat actor, and their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
- The question specifically mentions collecting data using crafted modules like pr.dll to upload stolen information to a C&C (Command and Control) server.
- It also mentions dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more, targeting specific sectors like the aerospace industry and political figures.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- APT28 is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, often using various techniques to evade detection and achieve their objectives.
- The use of crafted modules like pr.dll to upload stolen information to a C&C server is consistent with APT28's tactics.
- Dividing large files (0x1000000 bytes or more) could be a technique used to evade detection or to make the data more manageable for exfiltration.
- Targeting the aerospace industry and political figures aligns with APT28's known targeting of high-value targets.

However, the question does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that APT28 will divide files based on size. APT28's TTPs are highly adaptable and context-dependent.

Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that APT28 might employ this technique, but it's not a definitive indicator of their behavior.

However, since the question asks for a yes or no answer, and considering the context, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: A
