Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
- The question asks if it is likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document suggests a social engineering tactic, which is a common entry point for many attacks.
- The use of a COM object to execute queries to gather system information is consistent with the tactics of reconnaissance, which is a common step in the attack chain to gather information about the compromised system.
- The subsequent download of payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware suggests a lateral movement and execution of malicious activities, which is consistent with the tactics of an adversary to achieve their objectives.

Given the sequence of events described, it is likely that the adversary will use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: Spearphishing via Email).
2. Execution of a COM object to gather system information (Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: System Information Discovery).
3. Download of payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware (Tactic: Execution, Techniques: Command and Control, Data Encrypted).

Final Answer: A
