Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving CosmicDuke, which is a known malware. The sequence includes exfiltrating data via FTP, and then potentially using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection. This implies a specific sequence of actions.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that the malware exfiltrates data via FTP, which is a common method for data exfiltration.
2. It then asks if the malware is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.
3. The actions mentioned (searching removable drives and skipping certain file types) are typically associated with reconnaissance and data collection phases of an attack.
4. The use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer suggests a focus on gathering sensitive information from the compromised system.

Given the sequence of actions, it seems unlikely that the malware would use these tools after the data collection phase, as they are more likely to be used during the initial compromise or post-exploitation phase to gather additional information.

Final Answer: B
