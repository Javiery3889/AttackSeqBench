Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the exploitation of two specific vulnerabilities: MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler.
- The question asks if Stuxnet, after exploiting these vulnerabilities for lateral movement, is likely to use the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Stuxnet is a known malware that primarily uses the SMB protocol for C2 communication, not FTP. 
- The question mentions the exploitation of specific vulnerabilities for lateral movement, which is consistent with Stuxnet's behavior.
- However, the use of FTP protocol for C2 communication is not typical of Stuxnet's behavior.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Stuxnet is known for its use of SMB protocol for C2 communication, not FTP.
2. The question describes an attack sequence involving specific vulnerabilities, which is consistent with Stuxnet's behavior.
3. Given Stuxnet's known behavior, it is unlikely to use FTP protocol for C2 communication.

Final Answer: B
