Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving T1195 Supply Chain Compromise as the initial access vector.
- The question asks if it is likely that attackers leveraged legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using the compromised software update.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- T1195 Supply Chain Compromise typically involves compromising a software update or a third-party service to gain initial access to a target system.
- This type of attack often relies on the compromised software update being delivered to the target system, which could be done through various means, including legitimate credentials to access remote services.

Considering the nature of Supply Chain Compromise, it is plausible that attackers would use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services to obtain the compromised software update. This would allow them to deliver the update to the target system, thereby gaining initial access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Attackers often use Supply Chain Compromise as an initial access vector.
2. To deliver the compromised software update, attackers need to obtain access to the target system.
3. Leveraging legitimate credentials to log into external remote services is a common method for gaining access to systems.
4. Therefore, it is likely that attackers would use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using the compromised software update as the initial access vector.

Final Answer: A
