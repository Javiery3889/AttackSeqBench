Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by DDOS C2 servers in a campaign.
- The campaign's goal is to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and cause Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The use of single-byte XOR keys for encoding configuration files suggests that the attackers are using a simple encryption method to conceal their commands or data.
- The fact that two different keys were used implies that the attackers might be using a dynamic or adaptive approach to evade detection.
- However, the question asks if the attackers rebooted the target system after completing the wiping processes, which seems to be a contradictory action to the main goal of launching DDOS attacks.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice implies that the attackers would stop their primary objective (launching DDOS attacks) and reboot the system, which seems counterintuitive given the attackers' goal.
- B: No - This choice suggests that the attackers would continue with their primary objective (launching DDOS attacks) after completing the wiping processes, which aligns with the campaign's goal.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers' primary goal is to launch DDOS attacks against specific websites and cause a network failure.
2. The use of single-byte XOR keys for encoding configuration files is a simple encryption method, but it does not necessarily imply a change in the attackers' objective.
3. Rebooting the system after completing wiping processes would likely hinder the attackers' ability to achieve their primary goal.
4. Therefore, it is more plausible that the attackers would continue with their primary objective (launching DDOS attacks) after completing the wiping processes.

Final Answer: B
