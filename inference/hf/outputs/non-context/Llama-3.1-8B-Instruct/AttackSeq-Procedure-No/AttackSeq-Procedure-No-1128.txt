Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the NewsBeef group gaining initial access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents.
- The question asks if it is likely that Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic as part of the campaign's execution phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Spearphishing and watering hole attacks are tactics used to gain initial access, which is a common starting point for many cyber attacks.
- The use of macro-enabled Office documents is a common method for delivering malware, as macros can be used to execute malicious code.
- Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a feature in Microsoft Office that allows for the exchange of data between applications. However, it can also be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code, including PowerShell commands.
- JHUHUGIT and Koadic are known malware families that can be delivered through PowerShell commands.

Given the information, it is plausible that the NewsBeef group would use DDE to execute PowerShell commands to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic as part of their campaign's execution phase.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The NewsBeef group gains initial access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents.
2. The use of macro-enabled documents suggests that the attackers are attempting to execute malicious code.
3. DDE can be used to execute malicious code, including PowerShell commands.
4. JHUHUGIT and Koadic are malware families that can be delivered through PowerShell commands.
5. Therefore, it is likely that the NewsBeef group would use DDE to execute PowerShell commands to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic.

Final Answer: A
