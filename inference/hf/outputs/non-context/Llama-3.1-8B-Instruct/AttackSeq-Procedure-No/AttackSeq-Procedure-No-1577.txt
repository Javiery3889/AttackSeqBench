To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. Lateral movement by exploiting remote services: This suggests the attacker is using techniques like Remote Services (T1210) to move within the network.
2. Using internal spear phishing: This implies the attacker is using Spearphishing via Compromised Internal Resource (T1199) to trick users into divulging sensitive information or performing certain actions.
3. Using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network: This suggests the attacker is using Network Scanning (T1046) to identify potential targets within the network.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs (Remote Services, Spearphishing via Compromised Internal Resource, and Network Scanning) is plausible.

B: No - This answer choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.

Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is a common and plausible attack sequence. The attacker first gains access to the network by exploiting remote services, then uses internal spear phishing to gain more access and information, and finally uses network scanning tools to discover potential targets within the network. This sequence aligns with the tactics and techniques described in the question.

Final Answer: A
