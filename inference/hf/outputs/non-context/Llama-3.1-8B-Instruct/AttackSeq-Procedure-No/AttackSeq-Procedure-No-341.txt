Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a zero-day exploit:
  1. Leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access.
  2. Executing shellcode to make memory executable.
  3. Bypassing EAF (Elevation of Privilege) mitigation.
  4. Bypassing ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) protections.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the exploit will bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.
- Typically, in a typical exploitation sequence, an attacker would first bypass memory protection mechanisms like DEP to make the memory executable, and then attempt to bypass ASLR to gain control of the program flow.
- EAF mitigation is a technique used to prevent elevation of privilege attacks, which is usually a secondary step after gaining control of the program flow.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the exploitation phase, where the attacker is trying to gain control of the system.
2. The first two steps (leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects and executing shellcode to make memory executable) are typical steps in the exploitation phase to gain control of the system.
3. Bypassing EAF mitigation is a technique used to elevate privileges, which is a secondary step after gaining control of the system.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that the exploit will bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.

Final Answer: B
