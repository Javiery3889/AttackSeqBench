Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the CostaRicto Campaign and the SombRAT backdoor.
- It describes the initial communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
- The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that the initial communication with C2 servers is already established using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
- The SombRAT backdoor is likely to use the established communication channel for data exfiltration.
- Using a non-C2 protocol like HTTPS or SMTPS for data exfiltration would require establishing a new communication channel, which is not mentioned in the question.

Given the information, it is unlikely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol, as it would require additional steps not mentioned in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
2. The SombRAT backdoor is likely to use the established communication channel for data exfiltration.
3. Using a non-C2 protocol like HTTPS or SMTPS would require establishing a new communication channel, which is not mentioned in the question.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

Final Answer: B
