Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Korplug malware, which includes:
  1. Collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media.
  2. Proceeding with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.
  3. Gathering data from network shared drives.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol only before gathering data from network shared drives.
- This implies a specific order of operations: data exfiltration before gathering data from network shared drives.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice suggests that the malware will proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol before gathering data from network shared drives, which aligns with the sequence described in the question.
- B: No - This choice suggests that the malware will not proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol before gathering data from network shared drives, which contradicts the sequence described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a specific sequence of actions taken by the Korplug malware.
2. The sequence includes data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol before gathering data from network shared drives.
3. Answer choice A aligns with this sequence, while answer choice B does not.

Final Answer: A
