Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Dexphot, a known malware, using fileless techniques for defense evasion and obfuscation.
- The question asks if Dexphot is likely to use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Process hollowing is a technique used by some malware to load malicious code into legitimate system processes, making it harder to detect.
- Fileless techniques, like those used by Dexphot, often involve loading malware into memory without writing it to disk, making it harder to detect by traditional signature-based detection methods.
- Given that Dexphot is using fileless techniques for defense evasion, it is likely to use process hollowing to further evade detection and load its malicious code into legitimate system processes.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Dexphot uses fileless techniques for defense evasion, which implies it is designed to avoid detection by traditional methods.
2. Process hollowing is a technique used to evade detection by loading malicious code into legitimate system processes.
3. Given Dexphot's use of fileless techniques, it is likely to use process hollowing to further evade detection and load its malicious code.

Final Answer: A
