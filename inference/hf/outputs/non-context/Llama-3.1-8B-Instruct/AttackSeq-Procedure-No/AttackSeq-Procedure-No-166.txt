Analyzing the question and its answer choices:

1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10:
   - Internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for discovery.
   - Abuse of a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.
   - Leveraging shared MSP (Managed Service Provider) infrastructure.
   - Staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

2. Evaluating each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence in the question:
   - A: Yes - This answer choice suggests that APT10 is likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure before staging exfiltration data in the Recycle Bin.
   - B: No - This answer choice suggests that APT10 is not likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure before staging exfiltration data in the Recycle Bin.

3. Step-by-step reasoning:
   - The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs used by APT10, which includes abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.
   - The question does not mention leveraging shared MSP infrastructure before abusing the AD FS server's SAML token.
   - Therefore, the correct answer choice should align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

4. Final Answer: 
Based on the analysis, the correct answer choice is the one that aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question, which is abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure.

Final Answer: A
