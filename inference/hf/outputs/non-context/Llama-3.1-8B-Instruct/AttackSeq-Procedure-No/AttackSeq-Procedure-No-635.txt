Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers to compromise a Korean-language news portal.
- The sequence involves:
  1. Inserting malicious JavaScript code into a news portal.
  2. Redirecting victims to an exploit landing page.
  3. Exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- To exploit CVE-2019-13720, attackers would need to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive, which is typically achieved through heap spraying techniques.
- Heap spraying involves overwriting the heap memory with a large amount of malicious data, allowing attackers to control the memory layout and execute arbitrary code.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice suggests that attackers used heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode payload.
- B: No - This choice suggests that attackers did not use heap spraying techniques.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, which requires an arbitrary read/write primitive.
2. Heap spraying is a common technique used to achieve this primitive.
3. Therefore, it is likely that attackers used heap spraying techniques to gain the necessary primitive.

Final Answer: A
