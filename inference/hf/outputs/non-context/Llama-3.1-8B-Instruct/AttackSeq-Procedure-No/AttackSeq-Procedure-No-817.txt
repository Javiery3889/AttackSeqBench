To answer this question, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs mentioned:

1. WinDealer communicates with C2 servers.
2. It uses non-standard ports (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556).
3. It steals information from SNS applications.
4. It encrypts the stolen data using AES.

Now, let's compare and evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes - This answer choice suggests that WinDealer will follow the sequence of TTPs as described in the question.

B: No - This answer choice suggests that WinDealer will not follow the sequence of TTPs as described in the question.

Based on the information available about WinDealer, it is a known malware that uses non-standard ports to communicate with its C2 servers. This aligns with the first two TTPs mentioned in the question. Additionally, WinDealer is known to target SNS applications and encrypt the stolen data using AES, which aligns with the third and fourth TTPs mentioned in the question.

Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the known behavior of WinDealer.

Final Answer: A
