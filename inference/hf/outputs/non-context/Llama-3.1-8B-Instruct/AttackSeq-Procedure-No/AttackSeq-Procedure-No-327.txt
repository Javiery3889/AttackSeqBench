Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an iOS malware during the Command and Control (C2) phase, which includes:
  1. Sending gathered information
  2. Writing log messages
  3. Using a token for communication
  4. Uploading files

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The described TTPs are part of the Command and Control phase, which is a phase that typically occurs after the Discovery phase, where the malware gathers information about the victim's device.
- The described TTPs are focused on exfiltrating data, communicating with the C2 server, and uploading files, which suggests that the malware has already gained access to the device and is now in the C2 phase.
- The question asks if the app will subsequently collect information during the Discovery phase, which is the phase that precedes the C2 phase.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The described TTPs are part of the C2 phase, which occurs after the Discovery phase.
2. The Discovery phase is focused on gathering information about the victim's device.
3. The described TTPs are focused on exfiltrating data, communicating with the C2 server, and uploading files, which suggests that the malware has already gathered the necessary information during the Discovery phase.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that the app will collect information during the Discovery phase after it has already entered the C2 phase.

Final Answer: B
