Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where the Sunburst backdoor is delivered through a supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, which is a known incident.
- The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor will use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic when communicating with its C2 server.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Domain fronting is a technique used to disguise the destination of network traffic by using a legitimate domain name to mask the true destination.
- The Sunburst backdoor is known to use domain fronting to evade detection and blend in with legitimate traffic.
- Given the context of the question, it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will use domain fronting to communicate with its C2 server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Sunburst backdoor is known to be used in the SolarWinds supply-chain attack.
2. Domain fronting is a technique used by the Sunburst backdoor to evade detection.
3. The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor will use domain fronting to communicate with its C2 server.
4. Based on the known behavior of the Sunburst backdoor, it is likely that it will use domain fronting.

Final Answer: A
