Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a campaign involving phishing emails containing a malicious file named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
- The goal is to determine if the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through the phishing emails.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question does not explicitly mention the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 in the initial phishing emails.
- However, it does imply a sequence of events where the phishing emails are used to gain initial access, followed by potential exploitation of a vulnerability.

Given the information, we can infer that the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 is likely to occur after the initial access has been gained through the phishing emails. This is a common pattern in many attack sequences, where initial access is gained through social engineering or other means, and then the attackers use their access to exploit vulnerabilities in the compromised system.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file are sent to the target.
2. The recipient opens the malicious file, which likely contains malware or exploits.
3. The malware or exploit gains initial access to the target's system.
4. The attackers use their access to scan for vulnerabilities in the system, such as CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.
5. The attackers exploit CVE-2018-13379 to gain further access or escalate privileges.

Final Answer: A
