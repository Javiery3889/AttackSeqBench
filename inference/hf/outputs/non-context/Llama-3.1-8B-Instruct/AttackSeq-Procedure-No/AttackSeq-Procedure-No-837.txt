Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes APT28's initial access via spear-phishing campaigns using exploit documents.
- The question asks if APT28 will use specific tools (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE) before exploiting vulnerabilities and installing malware (GAMEFISH).

Comparing and Evaluating:
- APT28 is known for its sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- The tools mentioned (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE) are associated with APT28's TTPs.
- CHOPSTICK is a tool used for lateral movement, EVILTOSS is a tool for exfiltrating data, and SOURFACE is a tool for credential harvesting.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with APT28's known behavior of using initial access to gain a foothold, then using tools for lateral movement, data exfiltration, and credential harvesting before installing malware.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT28 gains initial access via spear-phishing campaigns using exploit documents.
2. To further expand their presence, APT28 would likely use CHOPSTICK for lateral movement to spread within the network.
3. After gaining a deeper understanding of the network, APT28 would use EVILTOSS to exfiltrate sensitive data.
4. To maintain persistence and control, APT28 would use SOURFACE to harvest credentials.
5. Finally, APT28 would install malware (GAMEFISH) to maintain a persistent backdoor.

Final Answer: A
