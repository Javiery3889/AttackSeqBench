Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker:
  1. Downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.
  2. Exploiting a chain of zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows.
  3. Achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation after the described sequence of TTPs.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question includes exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities and privilege escalation, which typically occurs before the Stager module is executed.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities and privilege escalation, which typically occurs before the Stager module is executed.
2. The Stager module is typically used to establish a connection back to the attacker's command and control (C2) server after initial access has been gained and privilege escalation has occurred.
3. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Stager module would notify of successful exploitation before the exploitation and privilege escalation have occurred.

Final Answer: B
