Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack scenario where HIDDEN COBRA intercepts customer transaction data through malicious scripts injected into store checkout pages. This suggests a web-based attack, likely using techniques like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Malicious scripts injected into store checkout pages
  2. Intercepting customer transaction data
  3. Exfiltrating collected data from the infected machine to the C2

Comparing and Evaluating:
- To exfiltrate data from the infected machine to the C2, HIDDEN COBRA would likely use a protocol that allows for covert data transfer. The MIME protocol is a standard for encoding and decoding email messages, which is not typically used for exfiltrating data in a covert manner.

- A more plausible protocol for exfiltrating data would be one that allows for covert communication, such as a protocol that uses encryption or steganography. However, the question does not provide any information about the use of such protocols.

- Given the options provided, we can only choose between the MIME protocol and not using it.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a web-based attack, which is consistent with HIDDEN COBRA's tactics.
2. The use of malicious scripts and data interception suggests a sophisticated attack.
3. Exfiltrating data to the C2 would require a protocol that allows for covert communication.
4. The MIME protocol is not typically used for covert data transfer.

Conclusion:
Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that HIDDEN COBRA is unlikely to use the MIME protocol for exfiltrating data. However, since the question only provides two options, we can only choose between "Yes" and "No".

Final Answer: B
