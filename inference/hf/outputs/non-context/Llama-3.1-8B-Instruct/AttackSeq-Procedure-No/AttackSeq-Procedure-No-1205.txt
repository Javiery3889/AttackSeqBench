Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a supply-chain attack where the Sunburst backdoor is delivered through a compromised SolarWinds system for initial access.
- The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol before the initial access is achieved.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- In a typical supply-chain attack, the initial access is achieved through the compromised system (in this case, SolarWinds).
- The Sunburst backdoor is a post-exploitation tool used to maintain persistence and elevate privileges after initial access has been achieved.
- The backdoor typically communicates with its C2 server after the initial access has been established to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

Given this understanding, it is unlikely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol before the initial access is achieved. The initial access is the first step, and the backdoor's primary function is to facilitate further actions after that initial access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access is achieved through the compromised SolarWinds system.
2. The Sunburst backdoor is delivered as part of the initial access.
3. The backdoor's primary function is to maintain persistence and elevate privileges after initial access.
4. Communication with the C2 server typically occurs after initial access to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: B
