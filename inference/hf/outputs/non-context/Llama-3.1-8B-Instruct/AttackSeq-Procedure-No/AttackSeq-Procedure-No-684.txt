Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by attackers:
  1. Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
  2. Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
  3. Deleting shadow volumes using vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet.
  4. Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible attack sequence. The first two steps involve reconnaissance and initial access, which is typical for attackers to gather information and gain a foothold in the system.
- The third step, deleting shadow volumes, is a technique used to evade detection by deleting Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) snapshots, which can be used for forensic analysis. This step is often used to cover tracks and make it harder to recover data.
- The fourth step, achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images, is a common goal for attackers, as it allows them to gain control over system resources and potentially spread malware.

However, the question asks if the attackers will delete shadow volumes before achieving their ultimate objective. The correct sequence should be that the attackers delete shadow volumes after gaining initial access and before achieving their ultimate objective.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice suggests that the attackers will delete shadow volumes before achieving their ultimate objective, which is not the correct sequence.
- B: No - This choice suggests that the attackers will not delete shadow volumes before achieving their ultimate objective, which aligns with the correct sequence of TTPs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Attackers deploy worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
2. They exploit exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
3. After gaining initial access, they delete shadow volumes to evade detection.
4. Finally, they achieve their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

Final Answer: B
