Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file, which is used to achieve initial access.
- The 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script is mentioned, which will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload.
- The 'sdmc.jpg' file is mentioned, which contains a base64 encoded script.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a sequence of actions: 
  1. Initial access is achieved through a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file.
  2. A PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1') is executed, which downloads a zip file containing malware components.
  3. The 'sdmc.jpg' file is involved, which contains a base64 encoded script.

Given this sequence, the 'fmx.ps1' script is executed before the 'sdmc.jpg' file is involved. Therefore, it is unlikely that the 'fmx.ps1' script will download a zip file containing malware components after the 'sdmc.jpg' file is decoded and executed.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial access is achieved through a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file.
2. The 'fmx.ps1' script is executed, which implies it is run before any other actions.
3. The 'fmx.ps1' script downloads a zip file containing malware components.
4. The 'sdmc.jpg' file is involved, which contains a base64 encoded script.
5. Given the sequence, it is unlikely that the 'fmx.ps1' script will download a zip file after the 'sdmc.jpg' file is decoded and executed.

Final Answer: B
