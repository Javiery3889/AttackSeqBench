Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of phases in a cyber attack: Discovery and Command and Control (C2).
- The Discovery phase involves collecting information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
- The question asks if the malware will initiate a download via FTP as part of the C2 phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Discovery phase is typically used to gather information about the target, which is consistent with the actions described (collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data).
- The Command and Control phase is used to establish communication between the malware and the attacker's command and control server, which may involve downloading additional malware or tools.
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring files over a network, which could be used for downloading malware or tools.

However, FTP is not typically associated with the C2 phase, as it is more commonly used for file transfers rather than real-time communication. A more common method for C2 communication would be protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or even DNS tunneling.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the Discovery phase, which is focused on gathering information.
2. The C2 phase typically involves communication between the malware and the attacker's server.
3. FTP is not a typical protocol used for C2 communication.

Given the information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not involve FTP as part of the C2 phase.

Final Answer: B
