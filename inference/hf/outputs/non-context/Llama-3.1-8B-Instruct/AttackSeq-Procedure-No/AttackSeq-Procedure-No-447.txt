Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions 'Agrius', 'IPsec Helper', 'Apostle', and 'DEADWOOD' malware. 
- It also mentions the sequence of events involving the 'Apostle' wiper failing execution and the 'DEADWOOD' malware being used for data destruction.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that 'Agrius' is a malware or a tool that uses 'IPsec Helper' to communicate with C2 servers.
- The 'Apostle' wiper failed execution, but it is likely to be used for data destruction, which is a common goal of wiper malware.
- 'DEADWOOD' malware is also used for data destruction, which aligns with the goal of the 'Apostle' wiper.

Given the context, it is plausible that 'Agrius' would use 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction after the 'Apostle' wiper failed execution.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. 'Agrius' is a malware or a tool that uses 'IPsec Helper' to communicate with C2 servers.
2. The 'Apostle' wiper failed execution, but it is likely to be used for data destruction.
3. 'DEADWOOD' malware is used for data destruction, which aligns with the goal of the 'Apostle' wiper.
4. Given the context, it is plausible that 'Agrius' would use 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction after the 'Apostle' wiper failed execution.
