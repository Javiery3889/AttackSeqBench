Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Hidden Cobra group using the Bankshot malware implant during the reconnaissance phase.
- The question asks if it is likely that the group would proceed to send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials during the reconnaissance phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question describes the use of Bankshot malware, which is a type of malware used for reconnaissance and data collection.
- The question then asks about the group sending Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials, which is a tactic typically associated with social engineering and credential harvesting.
- However, the use of Bankshot malware and the described social engineering tactic do not necessarily follow a direct sequence in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The use of Bankshot malware is a form of initial access and data collection, which is a common first step in many cyber attacks.
2. The described social engineering tactic of sending Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials is a form of credential dumping or credential harvesting, which is typically used after initial access has been gained.
3. However, the question does not provide a clear indication that the group has already gained initial access or that the social engineering tactic is a direct follow-up to the Bankshot malware use.
4. Given the lack of a clear sequence and the fact that the Bankshot malware is used for reconnaissance, it is unlikely that the group would proceed to send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials during the reconnaissance phase.

Final Answer: B
