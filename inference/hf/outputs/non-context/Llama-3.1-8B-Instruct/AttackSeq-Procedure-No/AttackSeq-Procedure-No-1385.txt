Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by FIN13, a threat group. The sequence includes:
  1. Employing passive backdoors (BLUEAGAVE) for establishing a local HTTP server.
  2. Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.
  3. Establishing persistence using tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a specific order of events: FIN13 first uses BLUEAGAVE to establish a local HTTP server, then exploits external servers for initial access, and finally uses SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for persistence.
- Answer choice A suggests that FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence. This contradicts the order of events described in the question.
- Answer choice B suggests that FIN13 will not exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence, which aligns with the order of events described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs used by FIN13.
2. The sequence starts with employing passive backdoors (BLUEAGAVE) and ends with establishing persistence using SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.
3. The question asks if FIN13 will exploit external servers for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence, which contradicts the described sequence.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that aligns with the described sequence.

Final Answer: B
