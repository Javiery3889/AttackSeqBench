Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an initial step of establishing a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution. This suggests that the attackers have already gained initial access to the target system.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems after establishing a C2 connection. This implies that the attackers have already achieved initial access and are now looking to further compromise the system.

Given the context, a phishing campaign would be an unusual step after already having established a C2 connection. Typically, a phishing campaign would be used to gain initial access, not after having already compromised a system.

However, considering the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, it is a malware that can be delivered through various means, including phishing. But in this scenario, the question implies that the C2 connection has already been established, which suggests that the attackers have already gained initial access.

Given the information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that the attackers have already compromised the system and are now looking to further compromise it, but a phishing campaign is not the most likely next step in this scenario.

However, considering the nature of the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, it is possible that the attackers might use it to deliver additional malware or to further compromise the system. But in the context of the question, it seems more likely that the attackers are looking to use the existing C2 connection to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, rather than conducting a phishing campaign.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have established a C2 connection through malicious VBA script execution, indicating they have already gained initial access.
2. The question asks if they will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, which would be an unusual step after already having compromised the system.
3. Considering the nature of the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, it is possible that the attackers will use it to further compromise the system, but a phishing campaign is not the most likely next step.

Final Answer: B
