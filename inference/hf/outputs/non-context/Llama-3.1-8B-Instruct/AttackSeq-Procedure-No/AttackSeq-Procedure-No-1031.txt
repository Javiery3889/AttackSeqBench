Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers for lateral movement within a network.
- The sequence includes using direct shell commands or Cobalt Strike features like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh to propagate beacons to other systems.
- The question asks if it is likely that attackers will then use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Lateral Movement tactic, which involves moving within a network to reach the target.
- The use of direct shell commands or Cobalt Strike features like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh for propagating beacons to other systems is a common technique for achieving lateral movement.
- After gaining access to other systems, attackers often engage in discovery activities to gather information about the network and Active Directory.
- Tools like ADFind and port scanning are commonly used for discovery, as they can provide valuable information about the network, including domain controllers, domain trusts, and other network devices.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Attackers use direct shell commands or Cobalt Strike features to propagate beacons to other systems within the network, which is a common technique for achieving lateral movement.
2. After gaining access to other systems, attackers typically engage in discovery activities to gather information about the network and Active Directory.
3. Tools like ADFind and port scanning are commonly used for discovery, as they can provide valuable information about the network and Active Directory.
4. Therefore, it is likely that attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process.

Final Answer: A
