Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) attributed to the Carbanak group, a notorious cybercrime gang. The sequence includes:
  1. LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
  2. SMB Relay attacks
  3. Mapping the organization's internal network
  4. Collecting administrative-level credentials
  5. Compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator
  6. Compromising additional endpoints

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Carbanak group is known for its sophisticated cybercrime operations, which often involve social engineering, malware, and network exploitation. LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks are both techniques that can be used to gain unauthorized access to a network. 
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the Carbanak group's tactics, which often involve reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and lateral movement to gain control over an organization's network.
- The use of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to map the network and collect credentials is consistent with the group's modus operandi.
