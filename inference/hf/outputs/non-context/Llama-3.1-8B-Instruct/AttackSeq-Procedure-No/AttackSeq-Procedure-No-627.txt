Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor and its use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel.
- The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework typically involves gathering information about the target environment, such as identifying active processes, services, and system information.
- Protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a C2 channel suggests that the attacker is attempting to maintain a covert communication channel, which is a common tactic in the initial stages of a cyber attack.
- Given that the SombRAT has already established a C2 channel, it is likely that the attacker would use this channel to gather information about the target system, which aligns with the actions of process discovery and system information discovery.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The SombRAT backdoor has established a C2 channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, indicating an initial stage of the attack.
2. The Discovery phase typically involves gathering information about the target environment.
3. Given the established C2 channel, it is likely that the attacker would use this channel to gather information about the target system.
4. Process discovery and system information discovery are common actions taken during the Discovery phase to gather this information.

Final Answer: A
