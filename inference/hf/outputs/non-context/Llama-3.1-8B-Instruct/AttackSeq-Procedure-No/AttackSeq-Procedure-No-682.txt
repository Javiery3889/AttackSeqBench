Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an initial access vector through misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
- The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The initial access vector through misconfigured Docker API ports is a common tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the "Exploitation of Public-Facing Applications" category.
- Gathering detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships is a common reconnaissance activity, which is a TTP in the "Reconnaissance" category of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Typically, after initial access, adversaries would perform reconnaissance to gather more information about the target environment before deploying malicious containers or further escalating their attack.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Adversaries exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access, which is a common tactic.
2. After initial access, adversaries usually perform reconnaissance to gather more information about the target environment.
3. Gathering detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships is a common part of reconnaissance.
4. Therefore, it is likely that adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

Final Answer: A
