Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions an app uploading files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.
- It also mentions the app sending gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- FTP is typically used for transferring files between a local machine and a server, often used in C2 operations for data exfiltration or uploading malicious files.
- HTTP is a protocol used for transferring data over the web, often used for C2 communication, data exfiltration, or sending stolen data to a C2 server.
- Performing routines on the iOS device implies some form of exploitation or data collection, which is likely to be followed by sending the gathered information to a C2 server.

Given the context, it's more plausible that the app would send the gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device, as this would be a common C2 operation. 

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The app uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its C2 operations, which is a common method for data exfiltration or uploading malicious files.
2. The app performs routines on the iOS device, which implies some form of exploitation or data collection.
3. After collecting data, the app would likely send the gathered information to a C2 server, which is typically done via HTTP protocol.

Final Answer: A
