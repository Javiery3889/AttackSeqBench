Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker:
  1. Presenting a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report to recipients.
  2. Sending spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents.
  3. Exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The sequence of TTPs implies a multi-stage attack. The first step is to gain the initial foothold by presenting a convincing document to the recipient.
- The second step involves using spear phishing emails to deliver the exploit, which suggests that the attacker has already compromised the recipient's system with QuasarRAT.
- However, the question asks if the recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- Choice A: Yes. This choice implies that the spear phishing emails are sent after the recipient has been infected with QuasarRAT, which contradicts the typical behavior of the attack sequence. In a typical attack, the spear phishing emails are used to deliver the initial payload (QuasarRAT), not after the initial infection.
- Choice B: No. This choice implies that the spear phishing emails are sent before the recipient is infected with QuasarRAT, which aligns with the typical behavior of the attack sequence. The initial document is used to gain the recipient's trust, and then spear phishing emails are used to deliver the exploit, which in turn delivers QuasarRAT.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a multi-stage attack sequence.
2. The first step is to present a convincing document to the recipient.
3. The second step involves using spear phishing emails to deliver the exploit.
4. The question asks if the spear phishing emails are sent after the recipient has been infected with QuasarRAT.
5. The typical behavior of the attack sequence is to use spear phishing emails to deliver the initial payload (QuasarRAT), not after the initial infection.

Final Answer: B
