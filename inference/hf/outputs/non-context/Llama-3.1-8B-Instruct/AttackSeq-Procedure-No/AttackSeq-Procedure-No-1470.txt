Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malicious actors, specifically mentioning BlackEnergy 3, a known malware family.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
  1. Reconnaissance activities (gathering publicly available information and active discovery methods)
  2. Malicious implant installation (through employee-enabled macro execution)
  3. Execution of payloads using Ruby scripts

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs used by BlackEnergy 3, which is a known malware family that has been used in various cyber attacks.
- BlackEnergy 3 is known to use various techniques to infect systems, including exploiting vulnerabilities and using social engineering tactics.
- After being installed on a network, BlackEnergy 3 is known to use various tools and scripts to execute payloads and maintain persistence.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the known behavior of BlackEnergy 3, which uses various scripts and tools to execute payloads after being installed on a network.
- B: No - This answer choice does not align with the known behavior of BlackEnergy 3.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. BlackEnergy 3 is a known malware family that uses various techniques to infect systems.
2. The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs used by BlackEnergy 3, including reconnaissance, implant installation, and payload execution.
3. BlackEnergy 3 is known to use scripts and tools to execute payloads after being installed on a network.
4. Therefore, it is likely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

Final Answer: A
