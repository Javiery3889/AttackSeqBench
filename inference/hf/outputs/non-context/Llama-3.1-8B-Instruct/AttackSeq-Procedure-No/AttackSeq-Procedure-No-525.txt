Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions a file-stealer module that iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.
- It also mentions the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant.
- The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Dropping Elephant is a known malware family that uses various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for its operations.
- File-stealing is a common TTP used by many malware families, including Dropping Elephant, to collect sensitive information.
- Defense evasion is another common TTP used by malware to avoid detection by security software.
- PowerShell is a popular tool used by attackers for defense evasion, as it can be used to execute malicious code without raising suspicion.

Given the context, it is plausible that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant would use encoded blobs to download PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Dropping Elephant is a known malware family that uses various TTPs for its operations.
2. File-stealing is a common TTP used by Dropping Elephant to collect sensitive information.
3. Defense evasion is another common TTP used by malware to avoid detection by security software.
4. PowerShell is a popular tool used by attackers for defense evasion.
5. Given the context, it is plausible that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant would use encoded blobs to download PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
