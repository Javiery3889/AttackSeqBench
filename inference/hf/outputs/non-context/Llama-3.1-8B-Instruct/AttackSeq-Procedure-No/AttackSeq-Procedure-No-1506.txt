Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving RIG EK (Exploit Kit) using proxy servers to evade detection.
- The question asks if the exploit server will use domain fronting for command and control (C2) operations.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- RIG EK is known for its use of proxy servers to make infections harder to detect, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
- Domain fronting is a technique used to disguise the destination of network traffic by routing it through a legitimate service, often a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This technique can be used for C2 operations to evade detection.
- Given that RIG EK is already using proxy servers to evade detection, it is plausible that it would use another technique like domain fronting to further disguise its C2 traffic.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. RIG EK uses proxy servers to evade detection.
2. Domain fronting is a technique used to disguise network traffic, which aligns with the goal of evading detection.
3. Given the initial use of proxy servers, it is likely that RIG EK would use domain fronting for C2 operations.

Final Answer: A
