Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Regin, which is a known advanced persistent threat (APT) malware.
- The question describes a discovery phase where the attacker is gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files.
- The question asks if Regin is likely to set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Regin is known for its sophisticated and stealthy nature, often used for espionage and data theft.
- The discovery phase typically involves reconnaissance and information gathering to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.
- Setting auto-forward rules on email accounts would be a means to monitor network traffic and gather more information, which aligns with the goals of the discovery phase.

However, Regin is also known for its ability to persist on a system for extended periods and gather sensitive information. Setting auto-forward rules might be more of an action taken during the initial compromise or later in the attack, rather than during the discovery phase.

Given the information, it seems that setting auto-forward rules might not be the most likely next step in the discovery phase, as it might be more of an action taken to maintain access or gather more information later in the attack.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Regin is a sophisticated malware used for espionage and data theft.
2. The discovery phase involves gathering information on processes, memory utilization, and scanning for deleted files.
3. Setting auto-forward rules on email accounts would be a means to monitor network traffic and gather more information.
4. However, this action might be more likely during the initial compromise or later in the attack to maintain access.

Final Answer: B
