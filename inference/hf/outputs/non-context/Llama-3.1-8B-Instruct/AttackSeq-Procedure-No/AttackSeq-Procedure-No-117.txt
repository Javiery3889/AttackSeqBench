Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
- The Tuyul malware is involved in the attack sequence.
- The question asks if the Tuyul malware will periodically download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence before executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Tuyul malware is known to be a malware that targets PHPUnit systems, which is consistent with the initial access vector mentioned in the question.
- The Tuyul malware is known to use various techniques to maintain persistence, including downloading and executing scripts.
- The mention of a bash script named 'cron' suggests a possible use of the cron job to maintain persistence, which is a common technique used by malware to execute tasks at regular intervals.

However, the Tuyul malware is known to use Perl scripts and shell commands for its operations, not bash scripts. 

Given this information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Tuyul malware will periodically download a Perl script to maintain persistence before executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.

Final Answer: A
