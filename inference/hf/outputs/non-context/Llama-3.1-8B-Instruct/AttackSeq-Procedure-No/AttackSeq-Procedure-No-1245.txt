Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor. SUNBURST is a known vulnerability (CVE-2020-10148) in the SolarWinds Orion platform.
- The question asks if SUNSPOT, another known malware related to SUNBURST, will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- SUNSPOT is known to be a variant of the SUNBURST malware, and it is used for lateral movement and discovery within the compromised network.
- MsBuild.exe is a legitimate process associated with Microsoft's MSBuild tool, which is used for building and deploying .NET applications.
- The Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves gathering information about the target environment, which can include identifying running processes.

Given the relationship between SUNSPOT and SUNBURST, and the purpose of the Discovery tactic, it is plausible that SUNSPOT would monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of its discovery activities.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. SUNBURST is a vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion platform.
2. SUNSPOT is a variant of the SUNBURST malware.
3. SUNSPOT is used for lateral movement and discovery within the compromised network.
4. The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the target environment.
5. Monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe is a plausible activity for discovery.

Final Answer: A
