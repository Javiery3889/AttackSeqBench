Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Nemesis bootkit achieving persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR).
- It asks if the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Nemesis bootkit is a type of bootkit malware that infects the VBR to achieve persistence. 
- Placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection, known as "Living off the Land" (LOTL) or "File and Directory Redirection" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework (T1218.010).

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the VBR, which is a common tactic used by bootkit malware.
2. To evade detection, malware often uses tactics like placing files in excluded directories, which is a known tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
3. Given the nature of the Nemesis bootkit and the tactics used by malware to evade detection, it is likely that the malware will use this tactic to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
