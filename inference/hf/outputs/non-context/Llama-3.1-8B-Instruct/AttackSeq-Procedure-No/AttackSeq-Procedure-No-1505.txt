Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions RIG EK (Exploit Kit) using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control (C2) operations.
- The question asks if it is likely that proxy servers will be used within RIG EK's infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- RIG EK is known for its sophisticated and evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- The use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for encryption suggests that RIG EK is attempting to evade detection by security software and network monitoring tools.
- Proxy servers are often used by threat actors to anonymize their C2 communications, making it harder to track the origin of the attacks and the infected systems.
- Given RIG EK's history of using advanced TTPs to evade detection, it is plausible that they would use proxy servers to further complicate the tracking of their C2 communications.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. RIG EK is known for its sophisticated TTPs, including encryption and evasion techniques.
2. The use of a custom RC4 algorithm for encryption is a sign of RIG EK's attempt to evade detection.
3. Proxy servers are commonly used by threat actors to anonymize their C2 communications.
4. Given RIG EK's history and the use of encryption, it is likely that they would use proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.

Final Answer: A
