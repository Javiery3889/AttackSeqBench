Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Mustang Panda, a known threat actor, using documents to connect to Command and Control (C2) domains and IP addresses as part of their communication strategy.
- The question asks if Mustang Panda is likely to utilize the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to evade defenses within their spearphishing campaign.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Mustang Panda is known for their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in spearphishing campaigns, which often involve using social engineering tactics to trick victims into executing malicious files.
- The double extension trick (e.g., sample.doc.lnk) is a technique used to evade defenses by making the file appear as a legitimate shortcut or link to a document, rather than an executable file.
- Given Mustang Panda's history of using social engineering tactics, it is plausible that they would use the double extension trick to evade defenses.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Mustang Panda is known for their use of social engineering tactics in spearphishing campaigns.
2. The double extension trick is a social engineering tactic used to evade defenses.
3. Given Mustang Panda's TTPs, it is likely they would use the double extension trick to evade defenses.

Final Answer: A
