Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Seaduke, which is a malware, and its actions: 
  1. Retrieving detailed bot/system information.
  2. Securely deleting itself using a 'seppuku' function.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if Seaduke will calculate the command-and-control (C2) port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value.
- This action is a common technique used by some malware to determine the C2 port, often referred to as a "port calculation" or "port obfuscation" technique.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Seaduke is a malware, and its actions suggest it is a sophisticated threat actor.
2. The 'seppuku' function is a self-deletion mechanism, which is a common feature in some malware.
3. The port calculation technique is a method used by some malware to determine the C2 port, making it a plausible action for Seaduke.

Given the information, it is likely that Seaduke will calculate the C2 port using the described method.

Final Answer: A
