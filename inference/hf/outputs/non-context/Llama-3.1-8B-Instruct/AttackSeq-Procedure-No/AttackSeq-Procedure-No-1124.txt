Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to gain initial access.
- The exploit targets CVE-2015-5119, which is a known vulnerability in Adobe Flash.
- The goal of the attack is to install a payload embedded in a GIF image.
- The question asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The attack sequence described involves a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to gain initial access.
- The use of CVE-2015-5119 suggests a targeted attack, likely using a zero-day exploit or a previously known exploit.
- The goal of the attack is to install a payload, which is often achieved through the execution of shellcode.
- Downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes is a technique often used by attackers to obtain credentials, but it is not directly related to the execution of shellcode or the installation of a payload.

Given the information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the shellcode will be executed to install the payload, and the NTLM hash capture is a separate step that may occur earlier in the attack chain.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Adobe Flash file 'show.swf' that exploits CVE-2015-5119.
2. The exploit gains initial access to the system.
3. The shellcode is executed to install the payload embedded in the GIF image.
4. The NTLM hash capture is a separate step that may occur earlier in the attack chain, but it is not directly related to the execution of shellcode or the installation of the payload.

Final Answer: B
