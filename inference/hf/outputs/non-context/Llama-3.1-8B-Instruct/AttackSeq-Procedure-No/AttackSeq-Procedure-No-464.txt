Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker:
  1. Capturing user credentials using a keylogger module.
  2. Performing OS credential dumping with known LOLBIN techniques.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the PowerLess Backdoor will use legitimate utilities such as AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access to victim environments.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The PowerLess Backdoor is likely a custom or custom-modified backdoor, given its name.
2. Custom backdoors often use legitimate utilities or tools to maintain persistence and remote access to the compromised environment to avoid detection.
3. AnyDesk and PuTTy are legitimate remote access tools that can be used for maintaining remote access to victim environments.
4. It is plausible that the PowerLess Backdoor would use these tools to maintain remote access, as it would be less suspicious than using a custom or known malicious tool.

Final Answer: A
