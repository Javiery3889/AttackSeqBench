Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving Buckeye, a known threat actor, using Backdoor.Pirpi to maintain presence and collect information about the network.
- The question asks if Buckeye is likely to use a DCSync command with Mimikatz to retrieve credentials from an exploited controller before targeting file and print servers to steal documents.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Buckeye is known for its use of Backdoor.Pirpi for maintaining persistence and gathering information.
- DCSync is a technique used with Mimikatz to obtain domain controller credentials, which is a common tactic used by Buckeye.
- After obtaining domain controller credentials, Buckeye would likely use this information to move laterally within the network, which aligns with targeting file and print servers to steal documents.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Buckeye uses Backdoor.Pirpi for maintaining presence and collecting information about the network, which is consistent with the question.
2. The use of DCSync with Mimikatz to retrieve credentials from an exploited controller is a plausible next step, given Buckeye's tactics.
3. Targeting file and print servers to steal documents is a common goal for Buckeye, and having domain controller credentials would facilitate this action.

Final Answer: A
