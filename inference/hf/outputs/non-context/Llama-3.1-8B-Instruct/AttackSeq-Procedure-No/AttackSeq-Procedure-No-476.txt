Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Chisel malware, which is known for its file exfiltration capabilities using Tor hidden services and SSH connections.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will perform a SYN flood attack on a host.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Chisel malware is primarily used for exfiltrating data, not for launching network attacks like SYN floods.
- SYN flood attacks are typically associated with Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which is not the primary function of Chisel malware.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Chisel malware is designed for data exfiltration, not for launching network attacks.
2. SYN flood attacks are a type of DDoS attack, which is not the primary function of Chisel malware.
3. Given the primary function of Chisel malware, it is unlikely to perform a SYN flood attack on a host.

Final Answer: B
