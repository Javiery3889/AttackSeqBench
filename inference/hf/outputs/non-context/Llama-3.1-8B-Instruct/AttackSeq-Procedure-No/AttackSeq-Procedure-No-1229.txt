Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the Lazarus group deploying Hermes ransomware, which encrypts files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leaves ransom notes in encrypted directories.
- The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group established command and control (C2) communication by utilizing backdoor malware to poll remote C2 servers for tasks and execute commands.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Lazarus group is known for their sophisticated and complex attacks, often using multiple tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to achieve their objectives.
- Deploying ransomware (T1486) and leaving ransom notes (T1527) are common tactics used by the Lazarus group to extort victims.
- Utilizing backdoor malware (T1210) to establish C2 communication is also a common technique used by the Lazarus group to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.

Given the context, it is likely that the Lazarus group would use backdoor malware to establish C2 communication to poll remote C2 servers for tasks and execute commands.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Lazarus group is known for their complex and sophisticated attacks.
2. They often use multiple TTPs to achieve their objectives.
3. Deploying ransomware and leaving ransom notes are common tactics used by the Lazarus group.
4. Utilizing backdoor malware to establish C2 communication is also a common technique used by the Lazarus group.
5. Given the context, it is likely that the Lazarus group would use backdoor malware to establish C2 communication.
