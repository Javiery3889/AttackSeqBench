Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the SideWinder APT group exploiting CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play.
- The question asks if the group likely employed techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection before using exploits from the C&C server, such as CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU, to root devices for privilege escalation.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The SideWinder APT group exploited CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access, which suggests they used an exploit to bypass security controls.
- To evade detection, it is common for threat actors to employ techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to make their malware harder to detect by security software.
- After gaining initial access, the group would likely use additional exploits from the C&C server, such as MediaTek-SU, to root devices for privilege escalation, which is a common goal for threat actors to gain higher-level access to the compromised system.

Considering these points, it is reasonable to assume that the SideWinder APT group would employ techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection before using additional exploits for privilege escalation.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The SideWinder APT group exploited CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access, which indicates they used an exploit to bypass security controls.
2. To evade detection, threat actors often use techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation.
3. After gaining initial access, the group would likely use additional exploits from the C&C server for privilege escalation.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the group employed techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
