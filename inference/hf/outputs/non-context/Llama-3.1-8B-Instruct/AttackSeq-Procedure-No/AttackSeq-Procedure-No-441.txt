Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Waterbear's backdoor configuration, which includes an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address.
- It also mentions the use of API hooking techniques to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The mention of API hooking techniques suggests that the attacker is attempting to evade detection by modifying system calls or API functions.
- Modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory is a common technique used in API hooking to evade detection, as it allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate system calls related to process creation and network communication.
- The use of XOR-encrypted C&C server address and encryption/decryption key in the backdoor configuration suggests that the attacker is attempting to maintain secrecy and avoid detection.

Given the context, it is likely that API hooking techniques will be used to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has configured a backdoor with an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address, indicating an attempt to maintain secrecy and evade detection.
2. The use of API hooking techniques is a common method to evade detection by modifying system calls or API functions.
3. Modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory is a specific technique used in API hooking to evade detection related to process creation and network communication.
4. Given the context, it is likely that the attacker will use API hooking techniques to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
