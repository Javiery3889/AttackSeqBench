Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker to gain initial access and establish persistence.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro.
  2. The VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe'.
  3. The malware creates a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.
  4. The VBA macro downloads and executes a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely to occur.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely to occur.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial access is gained through a phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain initial access.
2. The VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe', which is a legitimate Windows executable that can be used to execute scripts. This is a plausible next step in the attack sequence.
3. The malware creates a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours. This is a common technique used to establish persistence, as it allows the malware to run at regular intervals.
4. The VBA macro downloads and executes a dropper from a Blogspot URL. This is a plausible next step in the attack sequence, as attackers often use legitimate websites to host malicious content.

Based on the described sequence of TTPs, it is likely that the malware will establish persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours before the VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

Final Answer: A
