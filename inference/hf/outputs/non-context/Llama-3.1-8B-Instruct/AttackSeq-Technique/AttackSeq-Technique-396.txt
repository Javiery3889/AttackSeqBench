Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions a Linux Turla sample intercepting incoming packets without root access and executing commands via '/bin/sh -c'. This implies that the attacker has gained some level of access to the system but is not using root privileges.

Step 1: Identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
  1. Intercepting incoming packets without root access.
  2. Executing commands via '/bin/sh -c'.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence in the question.

- A: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable: This technique involves modifying the PATH environment variable to intercept commands. However, the question does not mention any modification of environment variables, so this is not the most likely next step.
- B: T1070-Indicator Removal: This technique involves removing evidence of the attack. The question does not mention any removal of indicators, so this is not the most likely next step.
- C: T1053.003-Cron: This technique involves using a scheduled task to execute commands. The question mentions executing commands via '/bin/sh -c', which is a command-line interface, not a scheduled task.
- D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. The question mentions executing commands via '/bin/sh -c', which is a command-line interface using the Bash shell.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer.
- The question mentions executing commands via '/bin/sh -c', which is a command-line interface using the Bash shell. This aligns with the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is using a command-line interface to execute commands.

Final Answer: D
