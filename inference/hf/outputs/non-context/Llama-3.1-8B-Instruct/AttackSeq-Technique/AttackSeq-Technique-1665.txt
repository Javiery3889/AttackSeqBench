Analysis of the question and its answer choices:

1. The question mentions that BlueBravo's malware gathers system information and then uses HTTPS protocol for bidirectional communication with their C2 servers. This indicates that the malware is using a protocol to communicate with the C2 servers.

2. The HTTPS protocol is used for encrypted communication, and RC4 and Base64 encoding are mentioned as the encryption methods used.

Comparing and evaluating the answer choices:

- A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the malware's communication with the C2 server. However, it does not specifically relate to the use of HTTPS protocol or encryption methods.

- B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using a legitimate application protocol to communicate with the C2 server. HTTPS is an application-layer protocol, and it is used for encrypted communication. This choice aligns with the use of HTTPS protocol for bidirectional communication.

- C: T1546.009-AppCert DLLs: This technique involves using a legitimate application's DLL to establish a connection with the C2 server. However, it does not specifically relate to the use of HTTPS protocol or encryption methods.

- D: T1106-Native API: This technique involves using native API calls to establish a connection with the C2 server. However, it does not specifically relate to the use of HTTPS protocol or encryption methods.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The question mentions the use of HTTPS protocol for bidirectional communication with the C2 servers.
2. HTTPS is an application-layer protocol, which aligns with answer choice B.
3. The use of RC4 and Base64 encoding for encryption is not explicitly mentioned in any of the answer choices, but it is a characteristic of HTTPS protocol.
4. Answer choice B is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question.

Final Answer: B
