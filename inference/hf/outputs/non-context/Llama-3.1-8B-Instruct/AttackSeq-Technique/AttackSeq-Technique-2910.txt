Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions APT15, a known threat actor, and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- The question specifically mentions the RoyalDNS backdoor, which is a known malware used by APT15.
- The question asks for the technique that likely occurred after obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.

Identifying the Sequence of TTPs in the Question:
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
  2. Installing the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistence.

Comparing and Evaluating the Answer Choices:
- A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories: This technique involves gathering information from various repositories, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- B: T1078-Valid Accounts: This technique involves obtaining valid accounts, which aligns with the first step of obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
- C: T1546.008-Accessibility Features: This technique involves enabling accessibility features, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials: This technique involves forging web credentials, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions obtaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, which is a technique for obtaining valid accounts (T1078).
2. The next step in the sequence is installing the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistence, which is not directly related to the answer choices provided.
3. Based on the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible answer choice is the one that aligns with obtaining domain administrator credentials.

Final Answer: B
