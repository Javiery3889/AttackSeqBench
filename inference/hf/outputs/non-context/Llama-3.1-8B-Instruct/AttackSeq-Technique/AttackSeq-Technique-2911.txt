Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack by APT15, which evaded policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe.
- The goal of this action is to facilitate the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable - This technique involves manipulating the kernel callback table to inject malicious code. While it's a kernel-level technique, it doesn't directly relate to evading policy settings or facilitating the installation of a backdoor.
- Answer Choice B: T1562-Impair Defenses - This technique involves evading or impairing security software, which aligns with the initial action of APT15 evading policy settings by patching cmd.exe. Impaired defenses would make it easier for the attackers to install the RoyalDNS backdoor.
- Answer Choice C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption - This technique involves encrypting data to evade detection. While it's a technique used in attacks, it doesn't directly relate to the described sequence of events.
- Answer Choice D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is not directly related to the described sequence of events.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT15 evaded policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe, which is a form of impairing defenses (T1562).
2. Impaired defenses would make it easier for the attackers to install the RoyalDNS backdoor.
3. Therefore, the most likely next step in the attack sequence is impairing defenses.

Final Answer: B
