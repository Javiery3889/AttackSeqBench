Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes an attack sequence involving Deep Panda executing PowerShell scripts and batch files to download and run additional malicious files, ultimately loading the Milestone backdoor.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- Execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files
- Downloading and running additional malicious files
- Loading the Milestone backdoor

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1648-Serverless Execution: This technique involves executing code without using a server, which is not directly related to the execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files.
- B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique involves the execution of commands or scripts to achieve a specific goal, which aligns with the execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files.
- C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities: This technique involves obtaining capabilities or tools to be used in the attack, which is not directly related to the execution of scripts and files.
- D: T1499.003-Application Exhaustion Flood: This technique involves overwhelming a system with traffic to exhaust its resources, which is not related to the described attack sequence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files, which is a key indicator of the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.
2. The execution of these scripts and files is used to download and run additional malicious files, which further supports the use of the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.
3. The ultimate goal of loading the Milestone backdoor is achieved through the execution of these scripts and files, reinforcing the use of the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.

Final Answer: B
