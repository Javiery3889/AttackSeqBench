Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions an attacker evading detection by disguising CertUtil.exe as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' to download additional payloads. This implies that the attacker is using a technique to make the malicious process appear legitimate.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter refers to the use of built-in scripting engines or interpreters to execute commands. This does not directly relate to disguising a process as a legitimate one.
- B: T1036-Masquerading involves making malicious software or a process appear as legitimate software or a process. This matches the description of disguising CertUtil.exe as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.
- C: T1070-Indicator Removal refers to the removal of security software or other tools that could be used to detect the attacker. This does not relate to disguising a process as legitimate.
- D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection involves manipulating the Windows Task Scheduler to run malicious tasks. This does not directly relate to disguising a process as legitimate.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of a legitimate process name to disguise a malicious process, which is a key characteristic of masquerading.
2. The use of CertUtil.exe and 'GoogleUpdate.exe' suggests that the attacker is making a malicious process appear as a legitimate one.
3. Based on the description, the most likely technique used by the attacker is masquerading.

Final Answer: B
