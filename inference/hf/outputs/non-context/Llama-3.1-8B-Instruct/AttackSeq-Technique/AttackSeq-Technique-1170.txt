Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attacker, Longhorn, maintaining operational security and avoiding detection during external communication with C&C servers.
- The key phrase is "maintain operational security and avoid detection," which implies the use of a secure communication channel.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- T1027.011-Fileless Storage: This technique involves storing malware in memory, which doesn't directly relate to maintaining operational security and avoiding detection during communication.
- T1029-Scheduled Transfer: This technique involves transferring data at a scheduled time, which might be used for data exfiltration but doesn't necessarily ensure operational security and avoidance of detection.
- T1029-Scheduled Transfer (Repeated): This is a duplicate of the previous option and still doesn't address the need for maintaining operational security and avoiding detection.
- T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate, which directly addresses the need for maintaining operational security and avoiding detection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question emphasizes the need for maintaining operational security and avoiding detection during external communication.
2. The use of a custom cryptographic protocol in the question implies the need for secure communication.
3. Among the given options, T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant to maintaining operational security and avoiding detection.

Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
