Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors acquire servers through compromise or legitimate purchase and then use them to configure malicious infrastructure for Command and Control (C2) purposes.

Identified TTPs in the question:
1. Compromise or legitimate purchase of servers
2. Configuring malicious infrastructure for C2 purposes

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment: This technique involves using spearphishing attachments to deliver malware. It does not align with the described sequence of using acquired servers for C2 purposes.
- B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities: This technique involves obtaining capabilities, which could be related to the acquisition of servers. However, it does not directly relate to configuring malicious infrastructure for C2 purposes.
- C: T1133-External Remote Services: This technique involves using external remote services, which could be a part of configuring malicious infrastructure for C2 purposes. However, it does not directly relate to acquiring servers.
- D: T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups: This technique involves adding users to local or domain groups, which is not directly related to configuring malicious infrastructure for C2 purposes.

However, the closest technique that aligns with configuring malicious infrastructure for C2 purposes after acquiring servers is T1133-External Remote Services. This is because configuring C2 infrastructure often involves setting up remote access to the compromised servers, which can be achieved through external remote services.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes threat actors acquiring servers through compromise or legitimate purchase.
2. The next step in the sequence is configuring malicious infrastructure for C2 purposes.
3. T1133-External Remote Services is the most plausible next step in the sequence as it involves setting up remote access to the compromised servers, which is necessary for C2 purposes.

Final Answer: C
