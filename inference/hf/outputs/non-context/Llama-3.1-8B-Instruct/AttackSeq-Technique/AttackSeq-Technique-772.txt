Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack initiated by Patchwork, which leverages an exploited CVE-2017-8750 through malicious RTF documents for Initial Access.
- The question asks about the technique most likely employed during the Reconnaissance phase to identify targeted recipients who interacted with their spear phishing emails.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Option A (T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT) is related to the execution of malicious code, which is more relevant to the Persistence or Privilege Escalation phase rather than Reconnaissance.
- Option B (T1596-Search Open Technical Databases) involves searching open technical databases, which could be a part of the Reconnaissance phase but is not directly related to identifying targeted recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.
- Option C (T1598-Phishing for Information) is a technique that involves using phishing to gather information, which aligns with the Reconnaissance phase and could be used to identify targeted recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.
- Option D (T1204-User Execution) is related to the execution of malicious code by a user, which is more relevant to the Execution phase rather than Reconnaissance.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 through malicious RTF documents for Initial Access, which indicates a phishing attack.
2. The question asks about the Reconnaissance phase, which involves gathering information about the target.
3. The technique should be related to gathering information about the target, specifically identifying targeted recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.
4. Option C (T1598-Phishing for Information) is the most relevant technique that aligns with the Reconnaissance phase and the context of the question.

Final Answer: C
