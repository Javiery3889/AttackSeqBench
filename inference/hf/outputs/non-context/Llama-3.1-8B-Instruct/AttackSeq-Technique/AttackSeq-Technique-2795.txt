Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions the XAgent app hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7.
- The goal is to collect geo-location data from the device.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- T1132-Data Encoding: This technique is used to encode data to evade detection or hide malicious activity. It doesn't directly relate to collecting geo-location data.
- T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules: This technique is used to leverage the system's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access. It's not related to collecting geo-location data.
- T1614-System Location Discovery: This technique involves discovering the location of the system or device. Given the context of the question, this seems like the most relevant technique for collecting geo-location data.
- T1033-System Owner/User Discovery: This technique is used to gather information about the system's owner or user. While it might be related to the device, it's not directly related to collecting geo-location data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the XAgent app running in the background on iOS 7, which implies the app is trying to collect data without the user's knowledge.
2. The goal is to collect geo-location data, which is a specific type of data related to the device's location.
3. T1614-System Location Discovery is the most relevant technique for collecting geo-location data.

Final Answer: C
