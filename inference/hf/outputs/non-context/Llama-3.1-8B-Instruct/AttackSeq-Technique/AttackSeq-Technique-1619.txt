Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 alters the timestamps of files downloaded by the second stage dropper to conceal them from victims who might list new files on the disk. This action implies that the attackers are trying to hide their malicious activities.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- Altering timestamps of files to conceal them from victims.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves encrypting communication between the attacker and the compromised system. It does not directly relate to altering file timestamps.
- B: T1218.013-Mavinject: This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process. It does not involve altering file timestamps.
- C: T1070-Indicator Removal: This technique involves removing or deleting security-related data, which could include logs or other indicators of malicious activity. However, it does not specifically involve altering file timestamps.
- D: T1546.017-Udev Rules: This technique involves creating or modifying udev rules to evade detection. However, it is not directly related to altering file timestamps.

However, none of the options directly match the action described in the question. But, considering the context of hiding malicious activities, the most plausible next step would be to remove or modify indicators of the malicious activity, such as logs or other security-related data. Among the given options, T1070-Indicator Removal is the closest to this action.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT28 altered the timestamps of files to conceal them from victims.
2. The next logical step would be to remove or modify indicators of the malicious activity to avoid detection.
3. Among the given options, T1070-Indicator Removal is the closest to this action.

Final Answer: C
