Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the XAgent app collecting information from an iOS device.
- The final step in the sequence is uploading files via FTP to a C2 server.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1204-User Execution is about executing a binary or script on a system, which does not directly relate to uploading files via FTP.
- Answer Choice B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS is about using a fast flux DNS to evade detection, which is not directly related to the action of uploading files via FTP.
- Answer Choice C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is about exploiting a vulnerability in the system's elevation control mechanism, which is not directly related to the action of uploading files via FTP.
- Answer Choice D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is about transferring tools or data from an external source to a system, which aligns with the action of uploading files via FTP to a C2 server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The XAgent app collects information from an iOS device.
2. The collected information needs to be sent to a C2 server.
3. The most direct method to send files to a C2 server is by transferring them via a protocol like FTP.
4. Therefore, the ATT&CK technique that facilitates this action is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

Final Answer: D
