Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where a custom tunneling tool is used for data exfiltration and a compromised router is leveraged to enable communication between corporate and restricted network segments.

Identified TTPs:
- Custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration
- Compromised router
- Enabling communication between corporate and restricted network segments

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1070.006-Timestomp: This technique involves modifying timestamps to evade detection. It does not directly relate to enabling communication between network segments or using a compromised router.
- B: T1090-Proxy: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the true source of a connection. While it could be used to enable communication between network segments, it doesn't specifically involve a compromised router.
- C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the target network's configuration. It's a reconnaissance step but doesn't directly enable communication between network segments.
- D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using non-standard protocols to communicate between systems. Given the use of a custom tunneling tool and a compromised router, this option seems most plausible as it involves leveraging a non-standard protocol (the custom tunneling tool) to enable communication between network segments.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration, which implies the use of a non-standard protocol.
2. The compromised router is used to enable communication between corporate and restricted network segments, suggesting the use of a non-standard protocol to bypass network restrictions.
3. Option D, T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol, aligns with the use of a custom tunneling tool and a compromised router to enable communication between network segments.

Final Answer: D
