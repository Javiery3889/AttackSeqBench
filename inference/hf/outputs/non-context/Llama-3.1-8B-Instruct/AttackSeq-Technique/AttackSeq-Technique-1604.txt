Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving persistence, evasion, and communication with a C&C server.
- The attacker has established persistence using a Windows shortcut in the startup folder and has evaded defenses by detecting virtualization or malware analysis tools.
- The communication with the C&C server involves JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1113-Screen Capture is related to capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
- Answer Choice B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation is a sub-technique of T1568-Protocol Analysis, which involves analyzing DNS traffic. However, it does not specifically involve leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers.
- Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service is related to web services, but it is not directly related to the use of public services as dead drop resolvers or JSON-encoded objects.
- Answer Choice D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution is a sub-technique of T1568-Protocol Analysis, which involves resolving domain names dynamically. This technique is often used in conjunction with dead drop resolvers, which are public services used to resolve domains. The use of JSON-encoded objects is also consistent with this technique.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has established persistence and evaded defenses, indicating a sophisticated attack.
2. The communication with the C&C server involves JSON-encoded objects, which is a common format for exchanging data.
3. The use of public services as dead drop resolvers suggests a dynamic resolution of domains, which is consistent with T1568-Dynamic Resolution.
4. This technique is a sub-technique of T1568-Protocol Analysis, which involves analyzing network protocols.

Final Answer: D
