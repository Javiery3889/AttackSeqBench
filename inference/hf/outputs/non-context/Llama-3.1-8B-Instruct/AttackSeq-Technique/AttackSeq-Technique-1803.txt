Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions encoding configuration files using single-byte XOR keys, which is a technique often used for data obfuscation or encryption.
- The context is about disrupting websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, which suggests a malicious or adversarial activity.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries - This technique is related to persistence and does not involve encoding or encryption of files.
- Answer Choice B: T1498-Network Denial of Service - This technique is related to disruption of service, but it does not involve encoding or encryption of files.
- Answer Choice C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood - This technique is related to disruption of service, but it does not involve encoding or encryption of files.
- Answer Choice D: T1590.001-Domain Properties - This technique is related to domain name system (DNS) manipulation, but it does not involve encoding or encryption of files.

However, none of the above choices directly relate to encoding configuration files using single-byte XOR keys. But, if we consider the broader context of disrupting websites, we can infer that the adversary might be using a technique to evade detection or hide their malicious activities. 

Given the options, the closest technique that might be related to encoding or encryption is not directly available. However, if we consider the broader context of disrupting websites, we can infer that the adversary might be using a technique to evade detection or hide their malicious activities.
