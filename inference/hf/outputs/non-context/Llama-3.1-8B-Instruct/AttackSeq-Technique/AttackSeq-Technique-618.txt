Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving an obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe' and the script deleting itself post-execution to evade detection.

Identified TTPs:
- Obfuscated VBS script
- Execution using 'wscript.exe'
- Self-deletion to evade detection

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1102-Web Service - This technique involves the use of web services, which is not directly related to the execution of a VBS script or self-deletion.
- Answer Choice B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity - This technique involves the use of compromised credentials, which is not mentioned in the question.
- Answer Choice C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications - This technique involves re-opening applications, which is not directly related to the execution of a VBS script or self-deletion.
- Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts - This technique involves hiding or deleting files and artifacts to evade detection, which aligns with the self-deletion of the VBS script post-execution.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions an obfuscated VBS script, which is a type of file or artifact.
2. The script was executed using 'wscript.exe', which is a legitimate Windows executable.
3. The script deleted itself post-execution to evade detection, indicating an attempt to hide or remove evidence of the attack.
4. Based on these details, the most plausible technique that occurred after the execution of the VBS script is hiding or deleting artifacts to evade detection.

Final Answer: D
