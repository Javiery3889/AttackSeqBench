Analysis of the question: 
- The Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems through functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl.'
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable access to the vulnerable systems.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. However, the question does not specify that the Tuyul botnet exploited a public-facing application.
- B: T1133-External Remote Services: This technique involves accessing a system using remote services. While this could be a possibility, it is not the most direct method for executing commands on a system.
- C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call: This is a sub-technique of T1055-Server Software Component, which involves using a server software component to execute malicious code. This is not directly related to executing commands on a system.
- D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute malicious code. Given that the Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems through functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl,' this is the most likely technique that occurred to enable access to the vulnerable systems.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems, which implies that the botnet had access to the systems.
2. The botnet used functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl,' which are command-line interfaces and scripting languages, respectively.
3. To execute commands on a system, the botnet would need to have access to a command or scripting interpreter.
4. Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred to enable access to the vulnerable systems is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

Final Answer: D
