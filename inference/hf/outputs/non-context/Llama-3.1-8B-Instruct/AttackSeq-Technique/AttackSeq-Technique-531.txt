- T1597-Search Closed Sources: This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources, which is not directly related to the BEC attempt or the blocking by Agari Advanced Threat Protection.
- T1074.002-Remote Data Staging: This technique involves staging data in a remote location, which is not directly related to the BEC attempt or the blocking by Agari Advanced Threat Protection.
- T1578.001-Create Snapshot: This technique involves creating a snapshot of the system or environment, which is not directly related to the BEC attempt or the blocking by Agari Advanced Threat Protection.
- T1656-Impersonation: This technique involves impersonating a legitimate user or entity, which is a common tactic used in BEC attacks. If the BEC attempt was blocked, the attacker might try to impersonate the blocked email or sender to try again.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions a BEC attempt being blocked by Agari Advanced Threat Protection.
2. The attacker might try to adapt their tactics to bypass the blocking.
3. Impersonation is a common tactic used in BEC attacks, and it's a plausible next step after a blocked attempt.
