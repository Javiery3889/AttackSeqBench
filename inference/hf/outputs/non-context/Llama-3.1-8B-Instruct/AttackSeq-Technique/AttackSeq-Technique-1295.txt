Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attacker establishing persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe to maintain a Poison Ivy server process.
- The goal is to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation: This technique is related to authentication, not communication encryption or protocol usage.
- B: T1090-Proxy: This technique involves creating a proxy to hide the attacker's IP address, which doesn't directly relate to securing communication using a custom network protocol.
- C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution: This technique involves executing code in response to a specific event, which is not directly related to securing communication.
- D: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which aligns with securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions establishing persistence and maintaining a server process, indicating the attacker is setting up a communication channel.
2. The goal is to secure this communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.
3. Among the given options, only T1573-Encrypted Channel directly addresses securing communication.
4. This technique would be used to protect the communication between the attacker and the Poison Ivy server process.

Final Answer: D
