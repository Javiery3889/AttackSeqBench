Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions BlackSoul establishing communication with a C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to transfer data over the C2 channel.

Identified sequence of TTPs:
- Establishing communication with a C2 server
- Using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1558.001-Golden Ticket is related to Kerberos ticket manipulation, which is not relevant to the given scenario.
- B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol involves transferring data over a non-C2 protocol, which aligns with the use of RESTful Strapi protocol for communication.
- C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a broad technique and does not specifically relate to the use of a specific protocol for data transfer.
- D: T1560-Archive Collected Data is related to archiving data, which is not directly related to the transfer of data over a C2 channel.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding for communication with the C2 server.
2. This indicates that the data transfer is likely happening over a non-standard C2 protocol.
3. Among the given options, B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol is the most relevant, as it involves transferring data over a non-C2 protocol.

Final Answer: B
