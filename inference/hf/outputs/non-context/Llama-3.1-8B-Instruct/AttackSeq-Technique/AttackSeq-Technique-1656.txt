Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions victims being redirected to compromised websites where scripts or HTML smuggling techniques were employed for malware delivery. This indicates a phishing or spearphishing attack, where the attackers use compromised websites to deliver malware.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites: This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is not directly related to the initial malware delivery via compromised websites.
- B: T1566-Phishing: This is a broad technique that involves using social engineering to trick victims into performing certain actions, but it's not specific to the scenario described.
- C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery: This technique involves gathering information about the system owner or user, which is not directly related to the malware delivery via compromised websites.
- D: T1566.002-Spearphishing via Link: This technique involves using spearphishing to trick victims into clicking on a malicious link, which is a plausible sequence of events after victims are redirected to compromised websites where scripts or HTML smuggling techniques are employed for malware delivery.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions victims being redirected to compromised websites, indicating a phishing or spearphishing attack.
2. The use of scripts or HTML smuggling techniques for malware delivery suggests a sophisticated phishing attack.
3. T1566.002-Spearphishing via Link is a specific technique that involves using spearphishing to trick victims into clicking on a malicious link, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

Final Answer: D
