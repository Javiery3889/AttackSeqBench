Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving spearphishing and the double extension trick for defense evasion.
- The double extension trick is a technique used to bypass security controls by disguising malicious files with a double file extension (e.g., 'document.exe.doc').
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using application-layer protocols to communicate with compromised systems. However, it does not directly relate to the double extension trick or spearphishing.
- Answer Choice B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding: This technique involves using non-standard encoding to evade detection. The double extension trick is a form of non-standard encoding, as it uses a non-standard file extension to disguise the malicious file.
- Answer Choice C: T1010-Application Window Discovery: This technique involves discovering open application windows on a system. It does not relate to the communication with compromised systems or the double extension trick.
- Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing: This technique involves using phishing to trick users into performing certain actions. While spearphishing is mentioned in the question, it is not the technique that facilitated communication with compromised systems.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions spearphishing and the double extension trick, which are used for initial access and defense evasion, respectively.
2. The double extension trick is a form of non-standard encoding.
3. Non-standard encoding is used to evade detection, but it does not directly facilitate communication with compromised systems.
4. However, non-standard encoding can be used in conjunction with other techniques to facilitate communication.

Final Answer: B
