Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving a backdoor to steal Google Chrome credentials.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before pings to the C2 server were transmitted at regular intervals.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- T1069-Permission Groups Discovery: This technique involves discovering permissions and group membership, which is not directly related to the transmission of pings to a C2 server.
- T1189-Drive-by Compromise: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a drive-by download, which is not directly related to the transmission of pings to a C2 server.
- T1530-Data from Cloud Storage: This technique involves exfiltrating data from cloud storage, which is not directly related to the transmission of pings to a C2 server.
- T1119-Automated Collection: This technique involves using automated tools to collect data, which could include transmitting pings to a C2 server at regular intervals.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions a backdoor to steal Google Chrome credentials, which implies that the attacker has already compromised the system.
2. The question asks for the technique that occurred before pings to the C2 server were transmitted at regular intervals.
3. Automated Collection (T1119) is a technique that involves using automated tools to collect data, which could include transmitting pings to a C2 server at regular intervals.
4. This technique is likely to occur after the initial compromise and before the transmission of pings to the C2 server.

Final Answer: D
