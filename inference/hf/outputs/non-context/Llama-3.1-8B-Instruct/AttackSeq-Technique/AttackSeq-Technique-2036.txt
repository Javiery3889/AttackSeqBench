Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions BlackEnergy 3 malware gaining initial access through exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
- This indicates that the malware exploited a vulnerability to gain initial access to the system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- T1053.007 (Container Orchestration Job) is related to the use of containers for command and control (C2) or other malicious activities, which is not directly related to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability.
- T1665 (Hide Infrastructure) is about concealing the infrastructure used for C2, which is a post-exploitation activity.
- T1204 (User Execution) is about tricking a user into executing a malicious file, which is not directly related to the exploitation of a vulnerability.
- T1622 (Debugger Evasion) is about evading debuggers, which is a technique used to avoid detection, but it's not directly related to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability.

However, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through exploitation of a vulnerability would be to execute the malware, which is User Execution (T1204). This is because the exploitation of a vulnerability typically results in the execution of the malware on the system.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager, which is a type of User Execution (T1204).
2. The exploitation of a vulnerability typically results in the execution of the malware on the system.
3. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access would be User Execution (T1204).

Final Answer: C
