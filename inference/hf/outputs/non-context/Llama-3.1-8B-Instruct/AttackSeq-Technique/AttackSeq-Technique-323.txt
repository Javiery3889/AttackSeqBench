Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where a backdoor has established an active connection with C2 servers on infected devices and enables the remote installation of new apps or code.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitates the threat actors' ability to evade detection and maintain a legitimate appearance during operations.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception is related to intercepting MFA, which is not directly related to evading detection or maintaining a legitimate appearance.
- Answer Choice B: T1078-Valid Accounts is about using valid accounts, which could be used to maintain a legitimate appearance, but it doesn't directly relate to evading detection.
- Answer Choice C: T1584.002-DNS Server is about using a DNS server, which is not directly related to evading detection or maintaining a legitimate appearance.
- Answer Choice D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution is about executing commands indirectly, which can be used to evade detection by making it harder to identify the malicious activity.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the backdoor enabling the remote installation of new apps or code, which implies the threat actors want to maintain a legitimate appearance.
2. To maintain a legitimate appearance, the threat actors would need to avoid detection, which means they would use techniques that make their activity look like normal system behavior.
3. Indirect Command Execution (T1202) is a technique that can be used to evade detection by making it harder to identify the malicious activity, as it doesn't directly execute the command, but rather executes it indirectly.

Final Answer: D
