Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by an attacker, SideCopy, which includes:
  1. Using njRAT malware.
  2. Special victim IDs of 'kavach'.
  3. GoLang-based file recon plugins.
  4. Exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception - This technique involves intercepting multi-factor authentication, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
- Answer Choice B: T1659-Content Injection - This technique involves injecting content into a document, which is not related to the described sequence of TTPs.
- Answer Choice C: T1056-Input Capture - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
- Answer Choice D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration - This technique involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network, which aligns with the described sequence of TTPs, as the attacker is exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker used njRAT malware, which is a type of remote access tool (RAT) used for malicious activities, including data exfiltration.
2. The use of special victim IDs of 'kavach' suggests a targeted attack on specific systems or devices.
3. The use of GoLang-based file recon plugins indicates the attacker is using a programming language to perform reconnaissance on the infected devices.
4. The final step is the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases, which is a type of sensitive data.

Based on the described sequence of TTPs, the most plausible next step would be the unauthorized transfer of data from the system or network, which is achieved through automated exfiltration.

Final Answer: D
