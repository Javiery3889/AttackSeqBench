Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an adversary who has already discovered critical systems and gained valid credentials to access the target network.
- The question asks about the next likely ATT&CK technique used by the adversary to move across the network.

Identified Sequence of TTPs:
- Discovery of critical systems
- Gaining valid credentials
- Moving across the network

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This technique involves using multiple channels to move laterally within a network, which aligns with the described sequence of gaining access and moving across the network.
- B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification: This technique involves modifying domain or tenant policies, which is not directly related to moving across the network.
- C: T1021.007-Cloud Services: This technique involves using cloud services, which is not directly related to the described sequence of gaining access and moving across the network.
- D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services: This technique involves exploiting remote services, which is not directly related to the described sequence of gaining access and moving across the network.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The adversary has already gained valid credentials, which indicates they have a means to access the network.
2. The next logical step would be to use this access to move across the network to further their objectives.
3. T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is a technique that involves using multiple channels to move laterally within a network, which aligns with the described sequence of gaining access and moving across the network.

Final Answer: A
