Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
- The sequence involves a coin miner saved on the host as /usr/sbin/docker-update.
- The next step in the sequence is the use of iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details.

Identifying the sequence of TTPs in the question:
- The sequence is: 
  1. Saving a coin miner on the host as /usr/sbin/docker-update.
  2. Using iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details.

Comparing and Evaluating the Answer Choices:
- A: T1542.004-ROMMONkit: This technique is related to the exploitation of a network device's management interface. It does not seem to be directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery: This technique involves discovering network connections and does not seem to be directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- C: T1595-Active Scanning: This technique involves actively scanning for hosts and services, which could be a precursor to tracking the number of infected hosts and obtaining their details.
- D: T1087-Account Discovery: This technique involves discovering account information, which does not seem to be directly related to the sequence described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The sequence described in the question involves a coin miner and tracking the number of infected hosts and obtaining their details.
2. The use of iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details suggests that the attacker is trying to gather information about the infected hosts.
3. Active scanning (T1595) would be a plausible precursor to gathering information about infected hosts, as it would allow the attacker to identify and locate the hosts.

Final Answer: C
