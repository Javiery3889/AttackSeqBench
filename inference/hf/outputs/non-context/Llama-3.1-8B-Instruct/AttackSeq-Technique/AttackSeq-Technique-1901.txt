Analysis of the question:

1. The question describes an attack sequence involving:
   - Initial access through exposed Weave Scope services.
   - Execution of a coin miner saved as /usr/sbin/docker-update.
   - Scanning for open Docker API endpoints.
   - Employing iplogger.org to track infected hosts.

2. The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when TeamTNT scanned for open Docker API endpoints and employed iplogger.org to track infected hosts.

Comparison and Evaluation:

- Option A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery - This technique involves discovering container and resource information. However, the question focuses on scanning for open Docker API endpoints and tracking infected hosts, which is more related to network discovery and tracking rather than container and resource discovery.

- Option B: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging - This technique involves impairing command history logging. The question does not mention anything about command history logging, so this option is not relevant.

- Option C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter - This technique involves using built-in command-line tools or scripting engines to execute commands. The question mentions the execution of a coin miner, which is a type of script or command, but the focus is on scanning for open Docker API endpoints and tracking infected hosts, not on command or scripting interpretation.

- Option D: T1007-System Service Discovery - This technique involves discovering network services. The question mentions scanning for open Docker API endpoints, which is a type of network service discovery. Employing iplogger.org to track infected hosts also involves network tracking, making this option the most relevant.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes an attack sequence involving scanning for open Docker API endpoints and tracking infected hosts.
2. The ATT&CK technique that involves discovering network services is relevant to this sequence.
3. Option D: T1007-System Service Discovery is the most relevant technique.

Final Answer: D
