Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker harvests corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections. This implies that the attacker has obtained sensitive information about the target's identity and possibly their network access credentials.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information: This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is already mentioned in the question. However, it doesn't directly relate to the movement within the target's networks.
- B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material: This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, which could be a plausible next step after obtaining credentials. It could be used to bypass traditional authentication mechanisms and gain access to the network.
- C: T1547.015-Login Items: This technique involves loading login items, which is more related to persistence and not directly related to the movement within the target's networks.
- D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools: This technique involves using software deployment tools, which is more related to the installation of malware or tools on the system, not directly related to the movement within the target's networks.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has already harvested corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections.
2. To facilitate movement within the target's networks, the attacker would need to use the obtained credentials to gain access to the network.
3. Using alternate authentication material (B) would be a plausible next step to bypass traditional authentication mechanisms and gain access to the network.

Final Answer: B
