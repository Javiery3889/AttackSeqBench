Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where a Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 (Command and Control) server to send information about current sessions.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely ensured data exfiltration over the same communication channel.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1040-Network Sniffing is a technique used to intercept and capture network traffic, but it does not directly relate to exfiltration over a C2 channel.
- Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the target system, which is not directly related to exfiltration.
- Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is a technique that involves exfiltrating data over the same communication channel used for C2 communication, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook is a technique used to exfiltrate data over a webhook, which is not directly related to the C2 channel described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a scenario where a Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server.
2. The question asks for the technique that ensures data exfiltration over the same communication channel.
3. Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel directly relates to exfiltrating data over the same communication channel used for C2 communication.

Final Answer: C
