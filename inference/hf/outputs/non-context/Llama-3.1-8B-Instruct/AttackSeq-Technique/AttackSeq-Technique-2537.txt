Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving fake Japanese documents to gain initial access.
- The sequence involves malware retrieving encrypted C&C (Command and Control) configuration information from blogs or microblogs under Command and Control.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- Initial access via fake documents
- Malware retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1497.001-System Checks: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, which might occur after initial access but doesn't directly relate to the malware retrieving C&C configuration information.
- B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique involves the adversary executing malware at boot or logon, which could be a possible step after initial access but doesn't directly relate to the malware retrieving C&C configuration information.
- C: T1078.003-Local Accounts: This technique involves the adversary using local accounts, which might be used for persistence but doesn't directly relate to the malware retrieving C&C configuration information.
- D: T1102-Web Service: This technique involves the adversary using web services, which could be used for Command and Control (C2) communication, including retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of fake Japanese documents to gain initial access, which is not directly related to the techniques listed.
2. The malware retrieves encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs under Command and Control, which suggests a communication mechanism.
3. T1102-Web Service is the most likely technique to be used for this purpose, as it involves the use of web services for C2 communication.

Final Answer: D
