Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
- The sequence includes:
  1. Executing the Raccoon stealer to collect data.
  2. Bypassing blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses.
