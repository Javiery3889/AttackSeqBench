Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
- The sequence involves an Explosive Trojan that dynamically unloads an Explosive DLL when the desired action is complete.
- The next step in the sequence is to leverage keylogging capabilities to obtain administrator passwords.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels - This technique involves using multiple channels to deliver malware, which doesn't directly relate to the sequence described in the question.
- Answer Choice B: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule - This technique involves creating a rule to forward emails, which is unrelated to the sequence described in the question.
- Answer Choice C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading - This technique involves loading code into a process using reflective loading, which is a method used by some malware to load DLLs. However, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts - This technique involves hiding or deleting files and directories, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

However, considering the context of the question, the Explosive Trojan dynamically unloading the Explosive DLL and then leveraging keylogging capabilities to obtain administrator passwords suggests that the malware is trying to maintain persistence and elevate privileges. 

A plausible sequence of TTPs that fits this scenario is:
1. The Explosive Trojan is used to deliver the malware.
2. The malware dynamically unloads the Explosive DLL when the desired action is complete (T1218-Credential Dumping).
3. The malware then uses the keylogging capabilities to obtain administrator passwords.

However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the Explosive Trojan dynamically unloaded the Explosive DLL. Based on the ATT&CK framework, the closest technique that fits this scenario is T1218-Credential Dumping, which involves obtaining sensitive information from local or network-based storage. However, this option is not available in the answer choices.

Considering the available options, the closest technique that fits the scenario is T1564-Hide Artifacts, but it's not the most accurate answer. However, given the available options, it's the best fit.

Final Answer: D
