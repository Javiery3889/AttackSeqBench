Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes an attack scenario involving Gamaredon's modules uploading harvested documents to a Command and Control (C2) server via HTTP and HTTPS.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. HTTP and HTTPS used for command and control
  2. Harvesting documents
  3. Uploading the harvested documents to the C2 server

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits: This technique is related to the maximum amount of data that can be transferred, but it does not directly relate to the action of uploading harvested documents to a C2 server.
- B: T1137.006-Add-ins: This technique is related to the use of add-ins in Microsoft Office, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.
- C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a victim's system to a C2 server, which aligns with the action of uploading harvested documents to the C2 server.
- D: T1106-Native API: This technique involves the use of native APIs to interact with the operating system, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the use of HTTP and HTTPS for command and control, which indicates that the attacker is using a C2 channel.
2. The question mentions the uploading of harvested documents to the C2 server, which involves the unauthorized transfer of data from the victim's system to the C2 server.
3. Based on the above analysis, the technique that most likely occurred is the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

Final Answer: C
