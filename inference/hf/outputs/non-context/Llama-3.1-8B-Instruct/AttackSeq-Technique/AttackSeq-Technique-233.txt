Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file, which is used to install the main payload.
- The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the malware in executing the payload without triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing is a technique used to trick users into performing certain actions, but it does not directly relate to bypassing UAC.
- Answer Choice B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism involves bypassing or abusing elevation control mechanisms, such as UAC, to gain elevated privileges. This technique aligns with the goal of executing the payload without triggering a UAC pop-up.
- Answer Choice C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs involves loading a DLL at application initialization, which is not directly related to bypassing UAC.
- Answer Choice D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data is a technique used to obtain sensitive information, but it does not relate to executing a payload or bypassing UAC.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file, which is used to install the main payload.
2. The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the malware in executing the payload without triggering a UAC pop-up.
3. Answer Choice B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism directly addresses the goal of bypassing UAC to execute the payload.

Final Answer: B
