Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a scenario where KiraV2 receives commands from a C&C server to execute DDoS attacks.
- It mentions the use of hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers for communication with the C&C server.

Identified sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence of TTPs is: 
  1. One-way communication (C&C server sends commands to KiraV2)
  2. Data encoding (hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers are used for communication)

Comparison and evaluation of answer choices:
- A: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket: This technique is related to Kerberos ticket manipulation, which is not relevant to the described scenario.
- B: T1102.003-One-Way Communication: This technique involves the C&C server sending commands to the malware, which aligns with the described scenario.
- C: T1132-Data Encoding: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection, which is part of the described scenario but not the first step.
- D: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service: This technique is related to DDoS attacks, which is the final step in the described scenario but not the step before data encoding.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The question describes a scenario where the C&C server sends commands to KiraV2, which indicates one-way communication.
2. The use of hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers for communication suggests data encoding.
3. Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred before data encoding is one-way communication.

Final Answer: B
