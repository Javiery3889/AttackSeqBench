Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions Kingslayer, which is a known malware, and a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for Defense Evasion.
- It also mentions the use of a stolen code signing private key for deployment.
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated its deployment into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.

Identified sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence involves a sophisticated software subversion.
- The malware (Kingslayer) uses a stolen code signing private key for Defense Evasion.
- The goal is to deploy the malware into enterprise environments.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer choice A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain: This technique involves compromising the supply chain of hardware, which is not directly related to the use of a stolen code signing private key for software subversion.
- Answer choice B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise: This technique involves compromising the supply chain of software, which aligns with the use of a stolen code signing private key for software subversion.
- Answer choice C: T1021.005-VNC: This technique involves using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for Command and Control, which is not related to the deployment of malware via software subversion.
- Answer choice D: T1219-Remote Access Software: This technique involves using remote access software for Command and Control, which is not related to the deployment of malware via software subversion.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions a sophisticated software subversion, which is a key aspect of the attack.
2. The use of a stolen code signing private key is a technique for Defense Evasion, but it is also a means to facilitate the deployment of malware via software subversion.
3. Answer choice B, T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, directly addresses the software subversion aspect of the attack.

Final Answer: B
