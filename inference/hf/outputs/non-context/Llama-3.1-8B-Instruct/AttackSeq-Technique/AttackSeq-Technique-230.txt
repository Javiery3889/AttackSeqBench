Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving backdoors installed as services, executing malicious functions, and then connecting to command and control (C2) servers.
- The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the installation of the backdoors but before they connected to C2 servers.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1552.008-Chat Messages - This technique involves using chat messages to communicate with the C2 server, which is likely to occur after the backdoors have connected to the C2 server.
- Answer Choice B: T1055-Process Injection - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a process, which could be a step in the execution of malicious functions by the backdoors.
- Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with the C2 server, which is likely to occur after the backdoors have connected to the C2 server.
- Answer Choice D: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket - This technique involves using a stolen or spoofed Kerberos ticket to authenticate to a target system, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The backdoors were installed as services capable of executing several malicious functions.
2. The next step would be to execute these malicious functions, which could involve injecting malicious code into a process to achieve the desired outcome.
3. After executing the malicious functions, the backdoors would then connect to the C2 server to receive commands.

Based on this reasoning, the technique that most likely occurred after the installation of the backdoors but before they connected to C2 servers is process injection.

Final Answer: B
