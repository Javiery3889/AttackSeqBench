Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence by GreyEnergy operators, starting with spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers for initial access.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before deploying modular malware functionalities dependent on specific combinations of modules uploaded to victim systems.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- T1087.001 (Local Account) refers to the creation of local accounts, which is not directly related to the deployment of modular malware.
- T1587 (Develop Capabilities) refers to the development of capabilities, which could involve creating or modifying malware, but it is a broad term and not specific to the deployment of modular malware.
- T1585.003 (Cloud Accounts) refers to the exploitation of cloud accounts, which is not directly related to the deployment of modular malware on victim systems.
- T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services) refers to the exploitation of remote services, which could be a precursor to deploying malware, but it is not specific to the deployment of modular malware.

However, considering the context of the question, the most plausible sequence would involve the exploitation of the compromised public-facing web servers for further actions. This would likely involve the exploitation of the remote services (T1210) to deploy the modular malware functionalities.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. GreyEnergy operators compromised public-facing web servers through spearphishing.
2. To utilize the compromised servers for further actions, they would need to exploit the remote services running on these servers.
3. This exploitation would allow them to deploy modular malware functionalities dependent on specific combinations of modules uploaded to victim systems.

Final Answer: D
