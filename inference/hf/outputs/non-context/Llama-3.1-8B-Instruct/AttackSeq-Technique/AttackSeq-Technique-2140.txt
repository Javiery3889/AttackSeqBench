Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker initially communicates with a C2 domain (judystevenson[.]info) and later pivots to other C2 domains (jack-fruit[.]club and camilleoconnell[.]website) using Googlebot-like user agent strings.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to establish communication with the initial C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer choice A (T1001.001-Junk Data) refers to the use of junk data to evade detection. This technique does not directly relate to establishing communication with a C2 domain.
- Answer choice B (T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks) involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. This technique is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 domain.
- Answer choice C (T1071-Application Layer Protocol) involves using application-layer protocols to establish communication with a C2 domain. This technique aligns with the scenario described in the question, where the attacker likely used a Googlebot-like user agent string to establish communication with the initial C2 domain.
- Answer choice D (T1566-Phishing) involves using social engineering to trick a user into performing a specific action. This technique does not directly relate to establishing communication with a C2 domain.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a scenario where an attacker communicates with a C2 domain and later pivots to other C2 domains using specific user agent strings.
2. The initial communication with the C2 domain (judystevenson[.]info) likely involved using a specific protocol to establish a connection.
3. Answer choice C (T1071-Application Layer Protocol) is the most relevant technique for establishing communication with a C2 domain using a specific protocol.

Final Answer: C
