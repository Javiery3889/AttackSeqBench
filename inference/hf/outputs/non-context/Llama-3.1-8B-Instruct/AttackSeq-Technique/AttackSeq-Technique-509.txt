Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor, which collected data in a custom storage file format.
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used to transfer the data from the victim's system.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- The backdoor collected data in a custom storage file format.
- The data needs to be transferred from the victim's system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB: This technique involves transferring data from a system to an external device, such as a USB drive. However, the question does not mention any physical device, making this option less likely.
- B: T1129-Shared Modules: This technique involves loading shared modules from a remote location. While it's a possible way to transfer data, it doesn't directly imply data exfiltration.
- C: T1590.001-Domain Properties: This technique involves modifying domain properties, which is not directly related to data exfiltration.
- D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves transferring data from a system to a command and control (C2) channel, which is a common method for backdoors like SombRAT to exfiltrate data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions a backdoor (SombRAT) collecting data, which implies that the data needs to be transferred from the victim's system.
2. The backdoor is likely to use its C2 channel to exfiltrate the data, as it's a common method for backdoors to communicate with their C2 servers.
3. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the most plausible technique for transferring the data from the victim's system.

Final Answer: D
