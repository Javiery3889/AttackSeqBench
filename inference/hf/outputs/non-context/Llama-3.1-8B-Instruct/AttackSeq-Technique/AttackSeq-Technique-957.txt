Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of events involving a Remote shell module communicating with a C&C server for operations such as file transfer and process creation.
- The question specifically asks about the technique used to download and transfer the Dropper module to the compromised system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer choice A: T1133-External Remote Services refers to the use of external services such as VPNs, SSH, or RDP to gain access to a system. This does not directly relate to the transfer of the Dropper module.
- Answer choice B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer refers to the transfer of tools or malware into a system, which aligns with the transfer of the Dropper module to the compromised system.
- Answer choice C: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation refers to the exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges, which is not directly related to the transfer of the Dropper module.
- Answer choice D: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver is a technique used to resolve a dead drop, which is a method of communication where the attacker provides the victim with a location to retrieve information. This does not align with the transfer of the Dropper module.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about the transfer of the Dropper module to the compromised system.
2. The technique used for this transfer should be related to the movement of tools or malware into the system.
3. Answer choice B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer directly refers to the transfer of tools or malware into a system, making it the most plausible choice.

Final Answer: B
