Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes FIN4's actions after transmitting stolen credentials through spearphishing emails to their C2 servers.
- The goal is to identify the ATT&CK technique that facilitated their anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- Spearphishing emails (T1566.001 - Spearphishing via Service)
- Transmission of stolen credentials to C2 servers

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information: This technique is about gathering information about the victim, which is not directly related to anonymous communication with C2 infrastructure.
- B: T1590.002-DNS: This technique involves using DNS for command and control (C2) communication, which could be a plausible method for anonymous communication.
- C: T1090-Proxy: This technique involves using a proxy to hide the attacker's identity, which could be used for anonymous communication.
- D: T1205.001-Port Knocking: This technique involves knocking on a port to gain access, which is not directly related to anonymous communication with C2 infrastructure.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks about anonymous communication with C2 infrastructure, which implies the need for a technique that facilitates hiding the attacker's identity or location.
2. T1590.002-DNS and T1090-Proxy are both techniques that can be used for anonymous communication.
3. T1590.002-DNS is specifically related to C2 communication, making it a more direct fit for the scenario described in the question.

Final Answer: B
