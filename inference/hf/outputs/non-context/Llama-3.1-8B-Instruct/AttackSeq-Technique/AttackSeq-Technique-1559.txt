Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions APT42, a known threat actor, gaining initial access via spear phishing and bypassing MFA.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to complement their credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Option A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate: This technique involves installing a root certificate to bypass certificate validation, which is not directly related to credential harvesting or using lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
- Option B: T1587-Develop Capabilities: This technique involves developing capabilities, which could include creating custom tools and backdoors, making it a plausible choice to complement credential harvesting efforts.
- Option C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts: This technique involves using social media accounts for reconnaissance, which is not directly related to credential harvesting or using lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
- Option D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing: This technique involves using spear phishing within an organization, which is already mentioned in the question and does not directly relate to using lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions APT42 using spear phishing and bypassing MFA to gain initial access.
2. The question asks for the technique that complements credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
3. Option B, T1587-Develop Capabilities, is the most relevant technique as it involves developing capabilities, which could include creating custom tools and backdoors.

Final Answer: B
