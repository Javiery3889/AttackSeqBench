Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions BRONZE PRESIDENT developing its own remote access tools and utilizing PRC-linked infrastructure.
- It also mentions employing tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution.

Identifying the sequence of TTPs:
- The question implies a sequence of events where BRONZE PRESIDENT first develops its own remote access tools and uses PRC-linked infrastructure, and then employs Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution.

Comparing and evaluating the answer choices:
- A: T1566-Phishing: This technique involves using phishing to trick users into divulging sensitive information. It doesn't directly relate to developing remote access tools or utilizing PRC-linked infrastructure.
- B: T1606.001-Web Cookies: This technique involves using web cookies to track user activity. It's not directly related to the development of remote access tools or the use of PRC-linked infrastructure.
- C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain: This technique involves compromising software supply chains to gain unauthorized access. While it's related to the use of PRC-linked infrastructure, it doesn't directly relate to developing remote access tools.
- D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities: This technique involves obtaining capabilities from a third-party source, which could include developing or purchasing remote access tools. It's the most plausible sequence of events, as it implies that BRONZE PRESIDENT obtained the capabilities (Cobalt Strike and PlugX) from a third-party source.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. BRONZE PRESIDENT developed its own remote access tools, which implies they needed capabilities to execute their operations.
2. They utilized PRC-linked infrastructure, which could be a source of obtaining capabilities.
3. They then employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution, which suggests they obtained these capabilities from a third-party source.

Final Answer: D
