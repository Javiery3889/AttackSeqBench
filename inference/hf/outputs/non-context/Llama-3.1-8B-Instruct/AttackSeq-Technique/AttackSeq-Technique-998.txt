Analysis of the question and its answer choices:

1. The question mentions the sequence of events:
   - Exfiltration using SmartFTP Client
   - Disabling protections
   - Deploying RYUK ransomware

2. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the attacker disabled protections and deployed the RYUK ransomware.

Comparing and evaluating the answer choices:

- A: T1127.001-MSBuild: This technique is related to building malicious software, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
- B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact: This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact, which aligns with the deployment of RYUK ransomware. However, it is not directly related to the disabling of protections.
- C: T1495-Firmware Corruption: This technique involves corrupting firmware, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
- D: T1106-Native API: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the system. Disabling protections and deploying RYUK ransomware could be a result of using native APIs to gain elevated privileges and evade security controls.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The attacker used SmartFTP Client for exfiltration, which suggests they have already gained access to the system.
2. The next step is disabling protections, which implies the attacker needs to gain elevated privileges to do so.
3. Deploying RYUK ransomware is a destructive action that requires elevated privileges.

Considering the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred before disabling protections and deploying RYUK ransomware is using native APIs to gain elevated privileges.

Final Answer: D
