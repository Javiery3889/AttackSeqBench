Analysis of the question:

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker. The sequence is as follows:

1. Exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to save and execute a file.
2. The executed file, "Rdws.exe", retrieves a second-stage PlugX file.
3. The second-stage PlugX file communicates with C2 (Command and Control) domains such as inocnation[.]com.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the communication between the second-stage PlugX file and the C2 domains.

Comparison and Evaluation:

- A: Steganography (T1001.002) is a technique used to hide malicious data within non-malicious files or communications. This technique is not directly related to the communication between the PlugX file and the C2 domains.
- B: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) involves using legitimate protocols to communicate with C2 servers. This technique is a strong candidate because PlugX is known to use various protocols to communicate with its C2 servers.
- C: Drive-by Compromise (T1189) refers to the compromise of a system through a drive-by download, which is not directly related to the communication between the PlugX file and the C2 domains.
- D: Data from Local System (T1005) involves collecting data from the local system, which is not directly related to the communication between the PlugX file and the C2 domains.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The question describes the exploitation of CVE-2015-5119, which is a vulnerability in the Windows kernel-mode driver.
2. The exploitation leads to the execution of a file named "Rdws.exe", which retrieves a second-stage PlugX file.
3. The second-stage PlugX file communicates with C2 domains such as inocnation[.]com.
4. The communication between the PlugX file and the C2 domains is likely facilitated by a technique that involves using legitimate protocols to communicate with the C2 servers.

Based on the above analysis, the most plausible technique that facilitated the communication between the PlugX file and the C2 domains is Application Layer Protocol (T1071).

Final Answer: B
