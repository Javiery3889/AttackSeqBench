Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of events involving process hollowing for defense evasion and evading detection while executing a second-stage payload.
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the malware started collecting information about active processes on the infected host.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A (T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions) is related to email permissions and does not directly relate to process information collection.
- Answer Choice B (T1573-Encrypted Channel) is about establishing an encrypted communication channel, which is not directly related to process information collection.
- Answer Choice C (T1012-Query Registry) involves querying the registry, which could potentially provide information about processes, but it's not the most direct method for collecting information about active processes.
- Answer Choice D (T1057-Process Discovery) directly involves collecting information about active processes on the infected host, which aligns with the described scenario.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a scenario where the malware has already used process hollowing for defense evasion and evading detection.
2. The next step in the attack sequence would likely involve the malware gathering information about the infected host to further its goals.
3. Collecting information about active processes would be a crucial step in this process, as it would allow the malware to identify potential targets for further exploitation.
4. Based on this reasoning, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred when the malware started collecting information about active processes on the infected host is T1057-Process Discovery.

Final Answer: D
