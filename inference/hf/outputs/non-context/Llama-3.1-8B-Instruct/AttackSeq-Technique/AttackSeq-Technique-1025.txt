Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Gamaredon, a threat actor, on a system. 
- The sequence involves discovering interesting files for future exfiltration and scanning all drives and removable media for sensitive files.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- Discovering interesting files for future exfiltration
- Scanning all drives and removable media for sensitive files

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could involve discovering interesting files. However, it does not necessarily involve scanning drives and removable media.
- B: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT: This technique involves using AutoHotKey or AutoIT to automate tasks, which is not directly related to discovering or scanning files.
- C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method: This technique involves archiving files using a custom method, which aligns with discovering and preparing files for exfiltration. It is a plausible step before scanning drives and removable media for sensitive files.
- D: T1106-Native API: This technique involves using native API calls to interact with the system, which is not directly related to discovering or scanning files.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions discovering interesting files for future exfiltration, which suggests that the threat actor is preparing files for exfiltration.
2. The next step mentioned is scanning all drives and removable media for sensitive files, which implies that the threat actor is looking for additional files to exfiltrate.
3. Based on these steps, the most plausible technique that occurred after discovering interesting files is archiving them for future exfiltration.

Final Answer: C
