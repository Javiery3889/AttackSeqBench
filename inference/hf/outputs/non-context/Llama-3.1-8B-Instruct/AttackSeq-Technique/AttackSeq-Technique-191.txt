Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of Infamous Chisel, which collects files from the local system and application directories.
- The goal is to exfiltrate these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Option A and B are the same, which is a duplicate answer choice. 
- Option C, T1614-System Location Discovery, is not directly related to the exfiltration of files. It is more related to gathering information about the system's location.
- Option D, T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood, is a denial-of-service (DoS) technique that is not relevant to the exfiltration of files.

The most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario involves the automated exfiltration of files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. This is a common technique used by attackers to exfiltrate data without being detected.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of Infamous Chisel, which is a tool used for exfiltration.
2. The goal is to exfiltrate files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections, which is a common method for evading detection.
3. Automated exfiltration is the most likely technique used in this scenario, as it aligns with the goal of exfiltrating files without human intervention.

Final Answer: B
