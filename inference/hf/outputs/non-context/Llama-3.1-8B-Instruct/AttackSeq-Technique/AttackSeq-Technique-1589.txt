Analysis of the question and its answer choices:

1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe, which is a legitimate process, and the execution of a payload. This suggests that the attacker is attempting to maintain persistence on the system.

2. The question asks about the technique that ensured T9000's components would run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

Comparing and evaluating the answer choices:

- A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: This technique is used to evade detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to ensuring components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

- B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities: This technique involves renaming system utilities to evade detection. It does not directly relate to ensuring components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

- C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique involves adding malware to the system to run or load at boot or logon. This would ensure that the malware runs or loads with every system startup, including user mode processes.

- D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to execute malware. While it could potentially lead to persistence, it does not specifically ensure that components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures T9000's components would run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot is related to adding malware to the system to run or load at boot or logon.

Final Answer: C
