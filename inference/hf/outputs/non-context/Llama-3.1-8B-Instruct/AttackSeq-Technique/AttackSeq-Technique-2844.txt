Analysis of the question and its answer choices:

1. The question mentions a malware sending system information to an IP address using the command line, which implies a communication with a Command and Control (C2) server.
2. The communication is done using HTTPS with a POST method, which is a common protocol for data transmission over the internet.

Comparing and evaluating the answer choices:

- A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver: This technique is used for communication between the attacker and the C2 server, but it typically involves a more covert method, such as using a dead drop or a hidden communication channel. The question does not specify any covert communication method, so this option is less likely.
- B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using legitimate protocols to communicate with the C2 server, which aligns with the HTTPS protocol mentioned in the question. The POST method is also a common application layer protocol used for data transmission.
- C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools: This technique is used for deploying malware or tools on a system, which is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
- D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance: This technique is used to terminate a cloud instance to prevent detection, which is not related to the communication with the C2 server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The question mentions a malware sending system information to a C2 server using the command line.
2. The communication is done using HTTPS with a POST method, which is a common application layer protocol.
3. Based on the information provided, the most likely technique used for this communication is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: B
