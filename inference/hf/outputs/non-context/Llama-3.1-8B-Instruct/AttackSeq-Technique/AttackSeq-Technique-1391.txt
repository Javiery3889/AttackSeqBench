Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of events where the SBDH malware downloads a backdoor and a data stealer after the execution phase.
- The question asks about the technique employed to ensure the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited on the infected system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1137-Office Application Startup: This technique involves modifying the startup settings of an office application to execute malicious code. This aligns with the scenario where the malware needs to run whenever a Word document is opened or edited.
- Answer Choice B: T1078.001-Default Accounts: This technique involves using default or weak credentials to access a system. This does not directly relate to the scenario of running malware when a Word document is opened or edited.
- Answer Choice C: T1559.001-Component Object Model: This technique involves exploiting the Component Object Model (COM) to execute arbitrary code. While this could potentially be used to execute malware, it is not directly related to the scenario of running malware when a Word document is opened or edited.
- Answer Choice D: T1119-Automated Collection: This technique involves using automated tools to collect information from a system. This does not directly relate to the scenario of running malware when a Word document is opened or edited.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a scenario where malware needs to run whenever a Word document is opened or edited.
2. The most plausible technique to achieve this would be to modify the startup settings of the office application.
3. Answer Choice A, T1137-Office Application Startup, directly addresses this requirement.

Final Answer: A
