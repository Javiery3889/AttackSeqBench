Analysis of the question and its answer choices:

1. The question mentions the TAIDOOR RAT, which is a type of malware. The question is asking about the ATT&CK technique used to establish communication with its C2 (Command and Control) servers after the malware is executed in memory.

2. The question is focused on the communication aspect, which implies a technique related to establishing a connection or communication channel.

Comparing and evaluating the answer choices:

- A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver: This technique is related to resolving a dead drop, which is a type of communication channel used by attackers. However, it's more about receiving information rather than establishing a communication channel.
- B: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is a common method used by attackers to avoid detection. This could be a plausible choice for establishing communication with C2 servers.
- C: T1053.003-Cron: This technique is related to using a scheduled task to execute a command, which is not directly related to establishing communication with C2 servers.
- D: T1204-User Execution: This technique involves executing a file or process on a user's system, which is not directly related to establishing communication with C2 servers.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The question is focused on the communication aspect after the malware is executed in memory.
2. The TAIDOOR RAT needs to establish a connection with its C2 servers to receive further instructions or send data.
3. Using non-standard ports (T1571) is a common method for attackers to establish communication with C2 servers without being detected.

Final Answer: B
