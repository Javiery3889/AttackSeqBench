Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence where Gamaredon uses a backdoor to list interesting files on the system during the discovery phase.
- The goal is to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1596.002-WHOIS is related to gathering information about the target's domain name and IP address, which is not directly related to gathering sensitive documents.
- B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls is about manipulating system or network security features to gain unauthorized access, which is not directly related to gathering sensitive documents.
- C: T1119-Automated Collection is about using automated tools to collect data from the system, which aligns with the use of a backdoor to automatically list interesting files.
- D: T1213.001-Confluence is related to gathering information about the target's network, which is not directly related to gathering sensitive documents.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of a backdoor to automatically list interesting files on the system, which indicates an automated collection of data.
2. The goal is to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares, which requires collecting data from the system.
3. Based on the ATT&CK framework, T1119-Automated Collection is the most likely technique to occur after the discovery phase to gather sensitive documents.

Final Answer: C
