Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving compromised hosts, use of tools (Conpee or Etso), and adding scheduled system tasks using credentials from pwdump6.
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitated C2 (Command and Control) communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- Compromised hosts
- Use of tools (Conpee or Etso)
- Adding scheduled system tasks
- Use of credentials from pwdump6
- C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A (T1071.003-Mail Protocols) is related to using email protocols for C2 communication, which is not directly related to the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
- Answer Choice B (T1595-Active Scanning) is related to scanning for open ports, which is not directly related to the use of port 443 for C2 communication.
- Answer Choice C (T1571-Non-Standard Port) is related to using non-standard ports for C2 communication, which aligns with the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
- Answer Choice D (T1583-Acquire Infrastructure) is related to acquiring infrastructure for C2, which is not directly related to the use of port 443 for C2 communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which suggests the use of a non-standard port for C2 communication.
2. Answer Choice C (T1571-Non-Standard Port) directly addresses the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
3. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the use of port 443 for C2 communication.

Final Answer: C
