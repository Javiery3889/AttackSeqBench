Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the Duke group gaining initial access to high-profile government networks using 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails.
- The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after initial access was gained but before the group leveraged Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- Initial access gained using 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails
- Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading - This technique involves masquerading as a legitimate user or process to gain access to a system. However, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of gaining initial access and then using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.
- Answer Choice B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which is not directly related to the sequence of gaining initial access and then using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.
- Answer Choice C: T1574.014-AppDomainManager - This technique involves creating or modifying an application domain to gain elevated privileges. While it's related to post-exploitation, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of gaining initial access and then using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.
- Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts - This technique involves hiding or deleting files, directories, or other data to conceal malicious activity. However, it's more related to post-exploitation and doesn't directly relate to the sequence of gaining initial access and then using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.

However, considering the context of the question, the most plausible sequence would involve the attackers establishing a foothold on the network after gaining initial access, and then using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access. This would involve the attackers creating a new application domain to obtain a Kerberos ticket, which is related to the AppDomainManager technique.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers gained initial access to high-profile government networks using 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails.
2. To establish a foothold on the network, the attackers would likely create a new application domain to obtain a Kerberos ticket, which is related to the AppDomainManager technique.
3. After establishing a foothold, the attackers would then leverage Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access.

Final Answer: C
