- Weaponized Word documents
- Malicious macros
- Links to malicious sites

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: T1218.013-Mavinject: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a Microsoft Office document. While it's related to the use of malicious macros, it doesn't directly describe the initial access vector mentioned in the question.
- B: T1566-Phishing: This technique involves using spear-phishing to trick users into performing certain actions. The question describes spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments and links, making this a likely precursor to the initial access.
- C: T1587-Develop Capabilities: This technique involves developing capabilities to support an attack. It's a broad category and doesn't specifically relate to the initial access vector described in the question.
- D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates: This technique involves using digital certificates to establish trust. It's not directly related to the initial access vector described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes spear-phishing emails as the initial access vector.
2. Spear-phishing is a type of phishing attack, which is described by technique T1566-Phishing.
3. The other options do not directly relate to the initial access vector described in the question.

Final Answer: B
