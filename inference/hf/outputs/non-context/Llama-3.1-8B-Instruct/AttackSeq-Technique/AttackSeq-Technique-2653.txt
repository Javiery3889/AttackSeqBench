Analysis of the question:

1. The question mentions Dridex, which is a banking Trojan known for its ability to evade detection through various techniques.
2. The question specifies that the malware employs heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques, which aligns with the tactics of evading detection.
3. The question asks about the technique used to communicate data with the Command and Control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.

Comparison and Evaluation:

- Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using legitimate protocols to communicate with C2 servers, which could involve encrypted POST requests. This seems plausible as it aligns with the communication aspect of the question.
- Answer Choice B: T1622-Debugger Evasion: This technique is about evading debugger detection, which is mentioned in the question but does not directly relate to communication with C2 servers.
- Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding: This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way, which could be used for evasion but does not directly relate to communication with C2 servers.
- Answer Choice D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations: This technique is about gathering information about the victim's physical location, which is unrelated to the communication aspect of the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The question mentions Dridex employing heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques, which is consistent with the tactics of evading detection.
2. The question asks about the technique used to communicate data with C2 servers via encrypted POST requests.
3. Answer Choice A, T1071-Application Layer Protocol, is the most relevant to the communication aspect of the question.

Final Answer: A
