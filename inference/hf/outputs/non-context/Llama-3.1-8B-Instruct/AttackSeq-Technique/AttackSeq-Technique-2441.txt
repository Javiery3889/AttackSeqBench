Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions Mustang Panda, a known threat actor, and the PlugX implant, a type of malware.
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to deploy the PlugX implant before fetching additional shellcode from a C2 IP address.

Identified sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence involves Mustang Panda, PlugX implant, and fetching shellcode from a C2 IP address.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using non-standard protocols to communicate with a C2 server. However, it doesn't directly relate to deploying the PlugX implant.
- T1053-Scheduled Task/Job: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious activities. It's a plausible way to deploy the PlugX implant, but it doesn't directly relate to fetching shellcode from a C2 IP address.
- T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools between systems within a network. It's not directly related to the described scenario.
- T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools from an external source into a network. It's a plausible way to deploy the PlugX implant and fetch additional shellcode from a C2 IP address.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions Mustang Panda and the PlugX implant, indicating a specific threat actor and malware.
2. The question asks about the technique used to deploy the PlugX implant before fetching additional shellcode from a C2 IP address.
3. T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the most plausible technique, as it involves transferring tools from an external source (C2 IP address) into the network, which aligns with deploying the PlugX implant and fetching additional shellcode.

Final Answer: D
