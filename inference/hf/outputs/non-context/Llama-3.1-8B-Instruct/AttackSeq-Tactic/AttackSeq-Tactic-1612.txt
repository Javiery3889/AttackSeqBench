Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions the Taidoor attackers establishing communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers using RC4-encrypted HTTP requests.
- The attackers then used this connection to upload files from infected machines.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Privilege Escalation (A) refers to the process of increasing the level of access or privileges of an attacker within a system. This does not align with the action of uploading files from infected machines.
- Command and Control (B) refers to the process of an attacker maintaining a connection with compromised systems to issue commands or receive data. While this is related to the communication with C&C servers, it does not specifically describe the action of uploading files.
- Initial Access (C) refers to the initial method an attacker uses to gain access to a system. This is not relevant to the action of uploading files from infected machines.
- Exfiltration (D) refers to the process of an attacker extracting data from a compromised system. This aligns with the action of uploading files from infected machines.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers established communication with C&C servers, which is a key component of Command and Control tactics.
2. The attackers used this connection to upload files from infected machines, which is a form of data extraction.
3. Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after establishing communication with the C&C servers is Exfiltration.

Final Answer: D
