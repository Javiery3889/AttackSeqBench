Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the malware "Tick" (likely referring to the malware "TICK" or "Tick) that infected systems via USB flash drives.
- The malware then evaded detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot.

Identified TTPs in the question:
- Initial Access: The malware infected systems via USB flash drives.
- Execution: The malware evaded detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Discovery: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which is not directly related to the described sequence of events.
- B: Initial Access: This tactic refers to the initial entry point of the attack, which has already occurred in the question.
- C: Execution: This tactic involves the execution of the malware, which aligns with the described sequence of events. The malware infected systems (Initial Access) and then executed its evasion techniques (Execution).
- D: Privilege Escalation: This tactic involves increasing the privileges of the malware, which is not directly related to the described sequence of events.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the malware infecting systems via USB flash drives, which is an example of Initial Access.
2. The question then describes the malware evading detection, which involves the execution of the malware's evasion techniques.
3. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access followed by Execution.

Final Answer: C
