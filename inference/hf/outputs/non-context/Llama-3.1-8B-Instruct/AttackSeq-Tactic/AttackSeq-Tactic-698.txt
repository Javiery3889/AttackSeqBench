Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group, which includes:
  1. Using dumpers on victim machines to retrieve credential-related databases.
  2. Scanning the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The first action (using dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases) is related to Credential Access, as it involves obtaining sensitive information such as credentials.
- The second action (scanning for specific file extensions) is related to Discovery, as it involves gathering information about the system and its contents.

Considering the sequence of actions, the first action (Credential Access) is followed by the second action (Discovery). This indicates that the group is first accessing credentials and then using that information to gather more data about the system.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Sednit group used dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases, which is a Credential Access tactic.
2. After obtaining credentials, the group scanned the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions, which is a Discovery tactic.

Final Answer: B
