Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions the Rising Sun implant, which is a known malware.
- The implant established communication with control servers through HTTP POST requests.
- The goal is to determine the next ATT&CK tactic that occurred after this communication was established.

Identified Sequence of TTPs:
- The Rising Sun implant was used.
- The implant established communication with control servers through HTTP POST requests.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Exfiltration - This tactic involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a system to an attacker-controlled location. However, the question does not explicitly mention data being transferred, only that the implant sent encrypted and obfuscated data.
- B: Resource Development - This tactic involves the creation of new tools, techniques, or infrastructure. The question does not mention the creation of new resources, but rather the use of an existing implant.
- C: Command and Control (C2) - This tactic involves the communication between an attacker and their malware or other tools. The question mentions the implant establishing communication with control servers, which aligns with C2.
- D: Execution - This tactic involves the execution of malicious code. The question does not mention the execution of code, but rather the communication of data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Rising Sun implant was used, which is a type of malware.
2. The implant established communication with control servers through HTTP POST requests.
3. The goal is to determine the next ATT&CK tactic that occurred after this communication was established.
4. The communication with control servers aligns with the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

Final Answer: C
