Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions FIN13 exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold in victim networks.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question describes the exploitation of external servers to deploy malware, which is a technique used for Initial Access (T1566).
- The deployment of web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) is a method for establishing a foothold in the victim's network, which aligns with the tactic of Persistence (T1542).

However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial exploitation and deployment of malware. 

- Execution (B) is the tactic of loading, running, or causing code to be executed on a target system. This is a plausible next step after the deployment of malware.
- Discovery (C) is the tactic of gathering information about the target environment, which might occur after the initial exploitation but is not directly related to the deployment of malware.
- Credential Access (D) is the tactic of obtaining valid accounts and/or credentials to access a target environment, which might occur after the initial exploitation but is not directly related to the deployment of malware.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. FIN13 exploited external servers to gain initial access to the victim's network.
2. The exploitation led to the deployment of web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold in the victim's network.
3. The next logical step after deploying malware would be to execute the malware to achieve the attacker's objectives.

Final Answer: B
