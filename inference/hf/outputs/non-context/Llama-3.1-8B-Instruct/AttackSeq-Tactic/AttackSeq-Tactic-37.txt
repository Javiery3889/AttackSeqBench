Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions a PowerShell script that avoided detection by operating in memory and leveraged the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk. This indicates the use of techniques to evade detection and execute files without being detected.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: Credential Access - This tactic involves obtaining valid credentials to access a system or network. The question does not mention anything related to credential access, so this is unlikely to be the correct answer.
- Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security products or the system's defenses. The question describes the PowerShell script avoiding detection by operating in memory and using the DCOM object, which aligns with defense evasion techniques.
- Answer Choice C: Execution - This tactic involves executing code or commands on a system. While the question does mention the execution of downloaded files, it does not specify that the execution was the primary goal, but rather a means to achieve another goal (avoiding detection).
- Answer Choice D: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing a communication channel with a command and control (C2) server. The question does not mention any communication with a C2 server, so this is unlikely to be the correct answer.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a PowerShell script that operates in memory to avoid detection.
2. The script leverages the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.
3. These actions are characteristic of defense evasion techniques, as they aim to avoid detection by security products or the system's defenses.
4. Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after these actions is also defense evasion.

Final Answer: B
