Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions "initial access" which is a key concept in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- The question also mentions spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, which are tactics used to gain initial access.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred before gaining initial access, which implies a precursor to the initial access.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Initial Access - This is the tactic that occurred after the precursor tactic, not before.
- B: Impact - This tactic is about causing harm or disruption, which is not relevant to the scenario described.
- C: Discovery - This tactic is about identifying potential targets, but it's not the most likely precursor to initial access.
- D: Reconnaissance - This tactic involves gathering information about potential targets, which is a precursor to initial access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that occurred before gaining initial access.
2. Spear-phishing and watering hole attacks are used to gain initial access.
3. The precursor to initial access is reconnaissance, as it involves gathering information about potential targets.
4. Reconnaissance is the most likely tactic that occurred before gaining initial access.

Final Answer: D
