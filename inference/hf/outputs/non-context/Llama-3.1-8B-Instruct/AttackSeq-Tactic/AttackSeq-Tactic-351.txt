Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions collecting data from an infected iOS device.
- The goal is to manage communication with the attackers while enabling remote updates and module management.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Collection (A) refers to gathering information from a system, which is already mentioned in the question.
- Reconnaissance (B) is the process of gathering information about a target before an attack, which is not directly related to managing communication or updates.
- Command and Control (C) involves establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system, enabling remote updates and module management.
- Resource Development (D) refers to creating or modifying tools, which is not directly related to managing communication or updates.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions collecting data from an infected iOS device, which indicates that the attacker has already compromised the system.
2. The goal is to manage communication with the attackers while enabling remote updates and module management, which suggests that the attacker needs to maintain a connection with the compromised system.
3. Command and Control (C) is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system, allowing for remote updates and module management.

Final Answer: C
