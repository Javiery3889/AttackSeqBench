Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers in a victim's environment.
- The sequence includes enumeration using commands like "whoami" and "Get-NetComputer".
- The attackers then executed commands and injected processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The sequence of actions described in the question indicates that the attackers first gathered information about the victim's environment (enumeration) and then used that information to move laterally within the network.
- The use of "whoami" suggests that the attackers were trying to identify the current user and their privileges, which is a common step in enumeration.
- The use of "Get-NetComputer" indicates that the attackers were gathering information about the network, which is also a part of the enumeration phase.
- The execution of commands and injection of processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon suggests that the attackers were moving laterally within the network.

Based on the sequence of actions, the most likely tactic that occurred before the attackers executed commands and injected processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon is Lateral Movement.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers used commands like "whoami" and "Get-NetComputer" for enumeration, which is a Discovery tactic.
2. The attackers gathered information about the victim's environment, which is a key step in the Discovery tactic.
3. The attackers then used the information gathered during the Discovery phase to move laterally within the network.
4. The execution of commands and injection of processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon is a key indicator of Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: B
