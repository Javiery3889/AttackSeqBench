Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions the Vyveva backdoor, which is a malware known for its capabilities.
- The question describes two actions: 
  1. The backdoor compressing files with zlib.
  2. Notifying the C&C about newly inserted removable media.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The action of compressing files with zlib is likely related to data manipulation or exfiltration, but it's not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
- Notifying the C&C about newly inserted removable media is a clear indicator of the backdoor's communication with its command and control (C2) server, which is a characteristic of Command and Control (C2) tactic.
- However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the described actions. Given the context, the action of notifying the C2 server about newly inserted removable media is likely a result of the backdoor's initial communication with the C2 server.
- Considering the options, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the described actions is Discovery, as it involves the backdoor discovering the newly inserted removable media, which would then be reported to the C2 server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The backdoor was established with persistence.
2. The backdoor likely performed Discovery to identify newly inserted removable media.
3. The backdoor compressed files with zlib, possibly as part of its operations or to prepare data for exfiltration.
4. The backdoor notified the C2 server about the newly inserted removable media.

Final Answer: D
