Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions T9000, which is a known threat actor, and its initial payload delivery via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. 

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Initial Access (via RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641)
2. Delivery of the initial payload by T9000

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial payload delivery. 
- Initial Access (D) is the tactic that occurred before the payload delivery, so it's not the correct answer.
- Credential Access (A) is a tactic that typically occurs after the initial payload delivery, as it involves the exploitation of credentials to gain further access to the system.
- Execution (B) is a tactic that also occurs after the initial payload delivery, but it involves the execution of the payload, not the access to credentials.
- Persistence (C) is a tactic that can occur after the initial payload delivery, but it involves maintaining access to the system, not necessarily accessing credentials.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial payload delivery.
2. Initial Access is the tactic that occurred before the payload delivery.
3. Credential Access is the most likely tactic to occur after the initial payload delivery, as it involves the exploitation of credentials to gain further access to the system.

Final Answer: A
