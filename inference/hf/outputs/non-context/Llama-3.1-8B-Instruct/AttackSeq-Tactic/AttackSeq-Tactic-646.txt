Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions delivering Gh0st RAT via email and employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.
- These actions indicate a sequence of tactics related to the initial compromise of a system and the execution of malicious code.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Delivering Gh0st RAT via email is a method of Initial Access, as it involves the initial compromise of a system.
- Employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL is a technique used in the Execution tactic, as it involves loading and executing malicious code on the compromised system.

Considering the sequence of events, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker first gained initial access to the system via email (Initial Access) and then executed the malicious code (Execution) by employing DLL side-loading techniques.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker delivered Gh0st RAT via email, which is a method of Initial Access.
2. The Gh0st RAT was likely executed on the compromised system.
3. To execute the Gh0st RAT, the attacker employed DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL, which falls under the Execution tactic.

Final Answer: C: Execution
