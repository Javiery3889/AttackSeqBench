Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions APT-TOCS, which is a known threat actor.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: 
  1. Utilizing "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
  2. Executing in memory to evade detection via operations without hard disk writing.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The first TTP mentioned is executing Shellcode scripts for remote control, which aligns with the Execution tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This is because the execution of Shellcode is a method of executing malicious code on a system.
- The second TTP mentioned is executing in memory to evade detection, which also aligns with the Execution tactic. This is because executing in memory is a method of executing malicious code without writing it to disk, which is a common evasion technique.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that the Execution tactic occurred after the first TTP and before the second TTP. 

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT-TOCS utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems. This is an example of the Execution tactic.
2. After executing the Shellcode scripts, APT-TOCS executed in memory to evade detection via operations without hard disk writing. This is also an example of the Execution tactic.

Final Answer: C
