Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
- The sequence starts with a phishing email delivering a malicious document with a VBA macro.
- The VBA macro is designed to execute further malicious activities.
- The malware then uses the 'mshta.exe' tool to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The sequence starts with a phishing email, which is a technique used for Initial Access (A).
- The VBA macro is executed, which is a technique used for Execution (B).
- The 'mshta.exe' tool is used to download and execute a dropper, which is also a technique used for Execution (B).
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the phishing email and before the 'mshta.exe' tool was used.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The phishing email is used for Initial Access (A).
2. The VBA macro is executed, which is a technique used for Execution (B).
3. The 'mshta.exe' tool is used to download and execute a dropper, which is also a technique used for Execution (B).
4. Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after Initial Access and before the 'mshta.exe' tool was used, the correct answer is the tactic that includes the execution of the VBA macro.

Final Answer: B
