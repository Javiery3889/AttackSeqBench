Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions ALLANITE, which is a known threat actor.
- The question describes the actions of taking screenshots of the target systems and conducting surveys during collection activities.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Taking screenshots and conducting surveys are reconnaissance activities, which are typically part of the collection phase of an attack.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after these actions, implying a progression in the attack sequence.
- The tactics in the ATT&CK framework are organized in a specific order, with Initial Access being the first step, followed by the collection phase (Reconnaissance), and then the exploitation of the collected information (Resource Development and/or Credential Access).

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions ALLANITE, which is known for its collection activities, indicating that the attack has already reached the collection phase.
2. The actions described (taking screenshots and conducting surveys) are typical of reconnaissance activities, which are part of the collection phase.
3. Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after these actions, we need to consider the next step in the attack sequence.
4. Given that the collection phase is complete, the next logical step would be to use the collected information to gain a benefit, such as accessing credentials or developing resources.

Final Answer: C: Resource Development
