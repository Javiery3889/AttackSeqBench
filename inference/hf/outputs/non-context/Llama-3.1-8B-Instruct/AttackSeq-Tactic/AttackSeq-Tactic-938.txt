Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions Tropic Trooper exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to execute commands and install an MSI package on the system.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after this exploitation.

Identified sequence of TTPs:
- Initial Access: Tropic Trooper exploited CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
- Execution: The exploitation of the vulnerability led to the execution of commands and installation of an MSI package on the system.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Initial Access - This is the initial step where the vulnerability was exploited, but it's not the tactic that occurred after the exploitation.
- B: Execution - This is the correct answer as it is the tactic that occurred after the exploitation of the vulnerability, where the commands were executed and the MSI package was installed.
- C: Credential Access - This tactic is not directly related to the exploitation of the vulnerability and the execution of commands.
- D: Resource Development - This tactic is not relevant to the exploitation of the vulnerability and the execution of commands.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
2. The exploitation of the vulnerability led to the execution of commands and installation of an MSI package on the system.
3. The ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the exploitation is the Execution tactic, as it involves the execution of commands and installation of software.

Final Answer: B
