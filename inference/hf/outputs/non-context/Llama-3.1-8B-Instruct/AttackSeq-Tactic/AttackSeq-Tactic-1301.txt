Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the OceanLotus threat actor.
- The sequence includes:
  1. Stolen credentials
  2. Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines via pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks
  3. Exfiltration of data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question indicates that the threat actor has already gained access to the network and is now moving laterally to infect new machines.
- The use of stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks suggests that the threat actor is attempting to maintain persistence and escalate privileges within the network.
- The final step of exfiltrating data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook implies that the threat actor has established a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial infection and before data exfiltration is lateral movement. This is because lateral movement is the process of moving within the network to infect new machines, which aligns with the use of stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The threat actor initially used stolen credentials to gain access to the network.
2. They then used Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines via pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks, indicating lateral movement within the network.
3. Finally, they exfiltrated data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook, which is a command and control tactic.

Final Answer: C
