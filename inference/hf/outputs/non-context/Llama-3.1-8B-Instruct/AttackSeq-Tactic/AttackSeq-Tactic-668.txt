Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions Dexphot, which is a known malware family.
- Dexphot is known to use process hollowing to load executables into system processes.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after process hollowing and before ensuring persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Process hollowing is a technique used for Defense Evasion (Tactic ID: T1055).
- Ensuring persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe is a technique used for Persistence (Tactic ID: T1542).
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after process hollowing and before ensuring persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Process hollowing is a technique used for Defense Evasion (T1055).
2. The question asks for the tactic that occurred after process hollowing, so we can eliminate options that occurred before process hollowing.
3. Ensuring persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using schtasks.exe is a technique used for Persistence (T1542).
4. The question asks for the tactic that occurred before ensuring persistence, so we can eliminate options that occurred after ensuring persistence.
5. Privilege Escalation (Tactic ID: T1548) and Credential Access (Tactic ID: T1552) do not directly relate to the sequence of process hollowing and ensuring persistence.
6. Therefore, the most plausible sequence is Defense Evasion (T1055) followed by Persistence (T1542).

Final Answer: C
