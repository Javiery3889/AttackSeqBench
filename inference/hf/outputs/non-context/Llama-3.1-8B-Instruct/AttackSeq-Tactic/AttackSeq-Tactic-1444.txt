Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions compromised web servers hosting ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts, which implies a malicious activity.
- The question also mentions tricking users into executing a malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking, which is a technique used to execute malicious code.

Sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Compromised web servers hosting ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts ( likely for initial access or resource development)
2. Tricking users into executing a malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking (Execution)

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Initial Access - This is the initial step of gaining access to the system, which is not the correct sequence in this case since the compromised web servers are already in place.
- B: Execution - This is the correct sequence, as the question mentions tricking users into executing a malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking, which is a technique used to execute malicious code.
- C: Collection - This is not relevant to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
- D: Discovery - This is not relevant to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions compromised web servers hosting ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts, which is likely for resource development or initial access.
2. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the preparation of the compromised web servers and before the execution of the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking.
3. Since the execution of the malicious DLL is the next step, the correct answer is the tactic that involves executing malicious code.

Final Answer: B
