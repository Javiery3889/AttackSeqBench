Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving Mustang Panda using scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and reverse shells to maintain a foothold and activate the PlugX RAT implant.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and reverse shells are techniques used for maintaining persistence and establishing a foothold on a compromised system.
- The activation of the PlugX RAT implant suggests that the attacker has successfully established a backdoor on the system, which is a key component of Command and Control (C2) operations.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Mustang Panda maintained their foothold through the use of scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and reverse shells. This indicates that the initial goal was to establish a persistent presence on the compromised system.
2. The activation of the PlugX RAT implant is a key component of the attack, as it allows the attacker to establish a backdoor for further C2 operations.
3. Given that the attacker has already established a foothold and activated a RAT, the next logical step would be to use the RAT for further malicious activities, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after the activation of the PlugX RAT implant.
4. Command and Control (C2) is the most likely next step, as the RAT implant is used to establish a C2 channel for the attacker to remotely access and control the compromised system.

Final Answer: C
