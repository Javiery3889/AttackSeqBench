Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an adversary.
- The sequence involves:
  1. Credential stuffing or password spraying attacks (obtaining usernames and passwords).
  2. Deployment of Cobalt Strike via a PowerShell one-liner for establishing command execution.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the deployment of Cobalt Strike.
- Credential stuffing or password spraying attacks are used for Initial Access, which is the first step in the attack chain.
- The deployment of Cobalt Strike via a PowerShell one-liner is a technique used for Execution, which is the next step after Initial Access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The adversary first obtained usernames and passwords through credential stuffing or password spraying attacks, which is a technique used for Initial Access.
2. After obtaining the necessary credentials, the adversary deployed Cobalt Strike via a PowerShell one-liner to establish command execution.
3. Therefore, the tactic that occurred before the deployment of Cobalt Strike is Initial Access.

Final Answer: B
