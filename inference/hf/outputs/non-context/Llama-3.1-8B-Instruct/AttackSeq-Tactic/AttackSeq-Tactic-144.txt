Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions FamousSparrow using SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C (Command and Control) server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question describes the use of a C&C server, which is a key component of Command and Control tactics.
- The use of HTTPS and encrypted communications suggests that the communication is secure, but it does not necessarily imply that the attacker is trying to impact the system or exfiltrate data.
- Collection tactics typically involve gathering information from the system, but the question does not provide any information about the attacker gathering information.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of a C&C server, which is a key component of Command and Control tactics.
2. The use of HTTPS and encrypted communications does not necessarily imply any other tactic, but it does not contradict the Command and Control tactic.
3. The question does not provide any information about the attacker trying to impact the system or exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: B
