Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence starting with spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents to gain initial access to the victim's system.
- The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before attackers employed an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is: 
  1. Initial Access (spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents)
  2. An undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.

Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer is likely a technique used for Discovery, which is a sub-tactic of Reconnaissance.

Answer Choices Evaluation:
- A: Reconnaissance - This is the most plausible answer choice as it includes Discovery, which involves gathering information about the victim's system.
- B: Execution - This is not the correct answer as Execution refers to the process of executing malicious code, which is not described in the question.
- C: Initial Access - This is not the correct answer as Initial Access refers to the initial entry point of the attack, which has already occurred in the question.
- D: Command and Control - This is not the correct answer as Command and Control refers to the communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which is not described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes an attack sequence starting with Initial Access through spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents.
2. The next step in the sequence is the use of an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.
3. Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this undocumented Word feature is likely used for Discovery, which is a sub-tactic of Reconnaissance.

Final Answer: A
