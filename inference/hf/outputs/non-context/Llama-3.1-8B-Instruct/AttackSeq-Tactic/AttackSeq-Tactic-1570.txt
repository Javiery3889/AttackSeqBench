Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details and 'unactivate.vbs' exfiltrating data using a POST request.
- The sequence of TTPs is: 'versioninfo.bat' -> 'unactivate.vbs'.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details is a Discovery tactic, which is the first step in the sequence.
- 'unactivate.vbs' exfiltrating data using a POST request is an Exfiltration tactic, which is the last step in the sequence.
- Command and Control (C2) is not mentioned in the sequence, so it's unlikely to be the correct answer.
- Defense Evasion is not relevant to the sequence of discovering system details and exfiltrating data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details is a Discovery tactic.
2. The next step in the sequence is 'unactivate.vbs' exfiltrating data using a POST request, which is an Exfiltration tactic.
3. Since Exfiltration is the last step in the sequence, it is the most likely tactic to occur after Discovery.

Final Answer: A
