Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary gained Initial Access through spear-phishing emails with a PDF linked to ENVYSCOUT.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to provide the infrastructure necessary for hosting delivery scripts and malware C2s.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Initial Access (B) is the tactic that occurred before the question, as it describes the initial entry point of the adversary.
- Execution (A) is the tactic that would occur after Initial Access, as it involves the execution of the malware or scripts on the compromised system.
- Command and Control (D) is the tactic that would occur after Execution, as it involves the communication between the malware and the C2 server.
- Resource Development (C) is the tactic that involves the development of the infrastructure necessary for hosting delivery scripts and malware C2s. This would be the most likely tactic to occur before the delivery of the malware, as it provides the necessary infrastructure for the malware to communicate with its C2 server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The adversary gained Initial Access through spear-phishing emails with a PDF linked to ENVYSCOUT.
2. To deliver the malware, the adversary would need to host the delivery scripts and malware C2s on an infrastructure.
3. The infrastructure necessary for hosting delivery scripts and malware C2s would be developed before the delivery of the malware.
4. Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to provide the infrastructure necessary for hosting delivery scripts and malware C2s is Resource Development.

Final Answer: C
