Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attacker using Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and compromising additional endpoints. This indicates the attacker has already gained initial access to the network and is now expanding their presence.
- The goal of the next step is to compromise numerous workstations in search of critical information, which suggests the attacker is looking for sensitive data.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Resource Development - This tactic involves creating or modifying tools to support the attack. While it's possible the attacker created a Cobalt Strike beacon, the question focuses on the use of the beacon for mapping and lateral movement, not the creation of the tool itself.
- B: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves evading detection by security controls. While the attacker may use defense evasion techniques, the question focuses on the lateral movement efforts, not evasion.
- C: Credential Access - This tactic involves obtaining valid accounts and credentials. While credential access can facilitate lateral movement, the question describes the use of a Cobalt Strike beacon to map the network and compromise endpoints, which suggests the attacker has already gained initial access.
- D: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. The question describes the use of a Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network, which is a form of discovery.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has already gained initial access to the network using Cobalt Strike beacon.
2. The next step is to expand their presence by compromising additional endpoints.
3. The goal is to find critical information on numerous workstations.
4. The most logical step before compromising workstations would be to gather information about the target environment to identify potential targets.

Final Answer: D
