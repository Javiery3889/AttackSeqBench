Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker, specifically TA505, which is known for its use of malicious MS Office documents.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Leveraging nefarious macros in malicious MS Office documents to download payloads.
  2. Achieving persistence with the addition of a 'Microtik' string value to the Windows Registry Run key.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The first TTP mentioned is the use of malicious macros to download payloads, which falls under the Execution tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This is because the attacker is executing code on the system to download payloads.
- The second TTP mentioned is achieving persistence by adding a string value to the Windows Registry Run key, which also falls under the Persistence tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the first TTP but before the second TTP.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The first TTP is the use of malicious macros to download payloads, which is an Execution tactic.
2. The second TTP is achieving persistence by adding a string value to the Windows Registry Run key, which is also a Persistence tactic.
3. Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the first TTP but before the second TTP, we need to find a tactic that logically follows the Execution tactic and precedes the Persistence tactic.
4. The most plausible sequence would be that after the attacker executed the code to download payloads (Execution), they would need to access the system to install or configure the downloaded payloads, which would require Initial Access.

Final Answer: D
