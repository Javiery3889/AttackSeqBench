Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving a backdoor from a Command and Control (C2) server, which implies the attackers have already established persistence.
- The attackers then compromised Domain Administrator credentials to move throughout the infrastructure, indicating a lateral movement tactic.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Defense Evasion is a tactic used to evade detection, but it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of compromising Domain Administrator credentials to move throughout the infrastructure.
- B: Lateral Movement is the most plausible answer, as it involves the attackers moving within the network using compromised credentials, which aligns with the sequence described in the question.
- C: Privilege Escalation is a tactic that involves increasing privileges, but it's not directly related to the sequence of compromising Domain Administrator credentials to move throughout the infrastructure.
- D: Persistence is the initial step mentioned in the question, which has already occurred.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have already established persistence with a backdoor from the C2 server.
2. To move throughout the infrastructure, the attackers need to gain access to Domain Administrator credentials.
3. The most logical step before compromising Domain Administrator credentials would be to move laterally within the network to reach the credentials.

Final Answer: B
