Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions a batch file that installed the main payload, which implies the Execution tactic (T1202 - Executed a Binary).
- The question also mentions bypassing User Access Control (UAC), which is a common technique used in Privilege Escalation (T1548 - Bypass User Account Control).

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: Discovery (T1046) is not directly related to the execution of a batch file or bypassing UAC.
- Answer Choice B: Execution (T1202) is the correct sequence of the initial action, but it does not involve gaining elevated privileges.
- Answer Choice C: Resource Development (T1497) is not directly related to the execution of a batch file or bypassing UAC.
- Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation (T1548) is the most likely sequence of the TTPs mentioned in the question, as it involves gaining elevated privileges by bypassing UAC.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial action was the execution of a batch file that installed the main payload, which aligns with the Execution tactic (T1202).
2. The next action involved gaining elevated privileges by bypassing User Access Control (UAC), which aligns with the Privilege Escalation tactic (T1548).

Final Answer: D
