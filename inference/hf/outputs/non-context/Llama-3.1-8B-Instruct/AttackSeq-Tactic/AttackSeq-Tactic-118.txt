Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving malicious emails, trojaned attachments, and the execution of the 'Surtr' malware by injecting it into a newly created explorer or iexplore process.

Identified sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial Access (malicious emails containing trojaned attachments were sent)
2. Execution (the 'Surtr' malware was executed)

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Resource Development - This tactic involves the development of tools, techniques, or infrastructure to support an attack. It does not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.
- B: Execution - This tactic involves the execution of malware or other malicious code. However, the question already mentions the execution of the 'Surtr' malware, so this is not the most likely tactic that occurred after the initial access.
- C: Impact - This tactic involves the exploitation of the compromised system to achieve the attacker's objectives. While it is a possible next step, it is not the most direct sequence of events described in the question.
- D: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial compromise of a system or network. The question describes malicious emails containing trojaned attachments being sent to Tibetan organizations, which is a common method of initial access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes malicious emails containing trojaned attachments being sent to Tibetan organizations, which is a method of initial access.
2. The next step in the sequence is the execution of the 'Surtr' malware by injecting it into a newly created explorer or iexplore process.
3. Based on the ATT&CK framework, the most direct sequence of events is Initial Access (malicious emails) followed by Execution (execution of the 'Surtr' malware).

Final Answer: D
