Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the OceanLotus threat actor.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Discovery (victim's computer information sent to a remote server)
  2. Custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Discovery - This is the first step mentioned in the question, where the victim's computer information is sent to a remote server. However, it is not the next step after the custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443.
- B: Impact - This tactic typically involves causing harm or disruption to the system, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- C: Command and Control (C2) - This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is likely used for C2, as it suggests a method of communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
- D: Exfiltration - This tactic involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a system to an attacker-controlled location. While this could be a possible next step, it is not as directly related to the custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 as C2 is.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes the initial step of sending victim's computer information to a remote server, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
2. The next step involves a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443, which is likely used for communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
3. Based on the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible next step is Command and Control (C2), as it involves communication between the attacker and the compromised system.

Final Answer: C
