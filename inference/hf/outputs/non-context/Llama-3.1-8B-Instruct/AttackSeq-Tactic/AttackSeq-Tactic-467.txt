Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions Gallmaker exploiting the DDE protocol for remote code execution without leaving artifacts on disk.
- This implies that the attacker has already gained initial access to the system.
- The next step in the attack sequence is establishing three primary IP addresses for their C&C infrastructure, which suggests communication with the attacker's command and control (C2) server.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Execution - This tactic refers to the execution of malicious code on the system. While this is a plausible step, it doesn't directly relate to establishing C2 infrastructure.
- B: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with the attacker's C2 server. Establishing primary IP addresses for C2 infrastructure is a key part of this tactic.
- C: Privilege Escalation - This tactic involves increasing the attacker's privileges on the system. While privilege escalation might be a necessary step, it doesn't directly relate to establishing C2 infrastructure.
- D: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves evading detection by security tools. Exploiting the DDE protocol without leaving artifacts on disk is an example of defense evasion, but it's not the next step in the attack sequence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions Gallmaker exploiting the DDE protocol for remote code execution without leaving artifacts on disk, which is an example of defense evasion.
2. The next step in the attack sequence is establishing three primary IP addresses for their C2 infrastructure.
3. Establishing C2 infrastructure is directly related to the Command and Control tactic.

Final Answer: B
