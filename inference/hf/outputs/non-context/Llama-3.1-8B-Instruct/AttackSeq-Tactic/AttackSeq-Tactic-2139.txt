Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions APT15, which is a known threat group.
- The question mentions the use of Mimikatz, a tool used for credential access.
- The question mentions exporting data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases, which implies data collection.

Sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz
2. Exported data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Credential Access - This tactic involves obtaining or stealing sensitive information, which aligns with the first step of gaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
- B: Reconnaissance - This tactic involves gathering information about a target, which does not align with the sequence of events described.
- C: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves evading detection, which does not align with the sequence of events described.
- D: Collection - This tactic involves gathering data, which aligns with the second step of exporting data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, which falls under the Credential Access tactic.
2. The next step in the sequence is exporting data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases, which falls under the Collection tactic.

Final Answer: D
