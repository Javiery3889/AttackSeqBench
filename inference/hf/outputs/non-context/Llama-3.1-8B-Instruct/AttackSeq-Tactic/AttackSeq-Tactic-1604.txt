Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used in the Freakyshelly targeted attack.
- The sequence includes identifying installed software through GET requests sent by Microsoft Word and bypassing detection by using an undocumented Word feature.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The sequence of TTPs described involves gathering information about the target system (identifying installed software) and evading detection (bypassing detection by using an undocumented Word feature).
- The tactic of identifying installed software is related to gathering information about the target system, which is a characteristic of the Discovery tactic.
- The tactic of bypassing detection is related to evading the security controls of the target system, which is a characteristic of the Defense Evasion tactic.

However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred prior to the bypass during the Freakyshelly targeted attack. Given the sequence of TTPs, the tactic of identifying installed software through GET requests sent by Microsoft Word is likely to occur before the bypassing of detection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Freakyshelly targeted attack involves identifying installed software through GET requests sent by Microsoft Word.
2. This action is a form of Discovery, as it involves gathering information about the target system.
3. The next action in the sequence is bypassing detection by using an undocumented Word feature, which is a form of Defense Evasion.
4. Therefore, the tactic that occurred prior to the bypass is Discovery.

Final Answer: B
