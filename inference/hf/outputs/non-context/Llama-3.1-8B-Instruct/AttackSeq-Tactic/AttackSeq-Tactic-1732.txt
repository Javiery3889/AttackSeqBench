Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
- The sequence involves malware components collecting system information, including IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings.
- The malware then self-deletes past a hardcoded date to avoid detection.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The initial action of collecting system information (IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings) aligns with the Discovery tactic, as it involves gathering information about the system and its environment.
- The self-deletion of the malware past a hardcoded date to avoid detection aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic, as it involves evading detection by the security controls.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial collection of system information but before the self-deletion.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial action of collecting system information is a Discovery tactic.
2. The self-deletion of the malware is a Defense Evasion tactic.
3. Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial collection of system information but before the self-deletion, we need to find a tactic that logically follows the Discovery tactic and precedes the Defense Evasion tactic.
4. The most plausible sequence is: Discovery -> [Credential Access or Exfiltration] -> Defense Evasion.
5. However, the question does not provide information about the collection of credentials, so we can rule out Credential Access.
6. Exfiltration is a plausible option as it involves the transmission or extraction of data, which aligns with the collection of system information.

Final Answer: B
