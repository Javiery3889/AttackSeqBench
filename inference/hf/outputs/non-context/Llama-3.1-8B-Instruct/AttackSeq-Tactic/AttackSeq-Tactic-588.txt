Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by attackers in Operation Aurora.
- The sequence includes exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, executing a malicious payload, and evading detection by masquerading backdoor connections as SSL connections.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer is an example of Initial Access (T1200).
- Executing a malicious payload is an example of Execution (T1204).
- Evading detection by masquerading backdoor connections as SSL connections is an example of Evasion (T1090), which is a sub-technique of Command and Control (C2) and can be categorized under the broader tactic of Command and Control (TA0011).

Given the sequence of TTPs, the tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to execute their malicious payload and before they evaded detection is Command and Control (TA0011), which includes the sub-technique of Evasion (T1090).

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, which is an example of Initial Access (T1200).
2. The next step in the sequence is executing a malicious payload, which is an example of Execution (T1204).
3. After executing the malicious payload, the attackers evaded detection by masquerading backdoor connections as SSL connections, which is an example of Evasion (T1090) and part of Command and Control (TA0011).

Final Answer: TA0011
