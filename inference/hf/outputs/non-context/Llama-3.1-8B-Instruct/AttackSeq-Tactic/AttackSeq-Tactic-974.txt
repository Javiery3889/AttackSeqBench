Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions CosmicDuke, which is a known malware family.
- The malware collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, indicating data collection.
- The question asks about the tactic that enables communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and exfiltration via FTP and WebDav servers.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2) - This tactic involves establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. The use of HTTP GET requests and exfiltration via FTP and WebDav servers suggests that the attacker is using these protocols to communicate with and exfiltrate data from the compromised system. This aligns with the C2 tactic.
- Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving within the network to reach other systems. The question does not mention movement within the network, so this choice is less likely.
- Answer Choice C: Execution - This tactic involves executing malicious code on a system. While the malware is executing, the question specifically asks about communication and exfiltration, which is not directly related to execution.
- Answer Choice D: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the system. While the malware is collecting information, the question specifically asks about communication and exfiltration, which is not directly related to collection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions CosmicDuke, a malware family known for its data collection capabilities.
2. The malware collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, indicating data collection.
3. The question asks about the tactic that enables communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and exfiltration via FTP and WebDav servers.
4. Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2) is the most plausible choice as it involves establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system, which aligns with the use of HTTP GET requests and exfiltration via FTP and WebDav servers.

Final Answer: A
