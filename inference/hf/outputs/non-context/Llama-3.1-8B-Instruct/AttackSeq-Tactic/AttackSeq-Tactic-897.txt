Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions POWERSHOWER entering a communications loop and receiving instructions via a GET request status code. This indicates that the attacker has already established a connection with the C2 server and is receiving commands.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred before this point.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Command and Control - This tactic involves an attacker using a C2 server to send commands to the compromised system. Given that POWERSHOWER is receiving instructions via a GET request status code, this suggests that the attacker has already established a C2 channel, making Command and Control the most likely previous tactic.
- B: Resource Development - This tactic involves the attacker creating or acquiring tools, techniques, or infrastructure to support the attack. While this could be a precursor to the attack, it is not directly related to the C2 communication.
- C: Initial Access - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the system. While this is an early stage of the attack, it is not directly related to the C2 communication.
- D: Discovery - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system. While this could be a precursor to the attack, it is not directly related to the C2 communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions POWERSHOWER entering a communications loop and receiving instructions via a GET request status code, indicating a C2 channel has been established.
2. The question asks for the tactic that occurred before this point.
3. Command and Control is the most likely previous tactic, as it involves the use of a C2 server to send commands to the compromised system.

Final Answer: A
