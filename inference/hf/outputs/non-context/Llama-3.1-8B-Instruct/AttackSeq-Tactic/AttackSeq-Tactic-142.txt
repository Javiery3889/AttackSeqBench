Analysis of the question:

- The question mentions FamousSparrow's SparrowDoor, which is a known malware.
- SparrowDoor probed files in specified directories during the Discovery phase, indicating reconnaissance.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the Discovery phase but before communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS as part of Command and Control activities.

Comparison and Evaluation:

- The Discovery phase is the initial reconnaissance phase where the attacker gathers information about the target environment.
- The Command and Control (C2) phase involves the attacker communicating with their C2 server to send or receive data.
- Execution involves the execution of malicious code on the target system.
- Collection involves gathering data from the target system.
- Resource Development involves the creation of new tools or malware.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible sequence is:
1. Discovery (probing files in specified directories)
2. Collection (gathering data from the target system)
3. Command and Control (communicating with the C2 server over HTTPS)

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the Discovery phase but before communicating with the C2 server is Collection.

Final Answer: C
