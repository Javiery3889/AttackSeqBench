Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions that stolen credentials were sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols. This indicates that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now transmitting the stolen credentials to a C2 server for further exploitation.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Initial Access refers to the initial entry point of the attack, which has already occurred in this scenario.
- B: Exfiltration refers to the act of extracting data from a system, which is not directly related to sending stolen credentials to a C2 server.
- C: Command and Control refers to the communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which aligns with sending stolen credentials to a C2 server.
- D: Credential Access refers to the act of obtaining or stealing credentials, which has already occurred in this scenario.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions that stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server, indicating communication between the attacker and the compromised system.
2. This communication is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
3. The other options do not directly relate to the communication aspect of the attack.

Final Answer: C
