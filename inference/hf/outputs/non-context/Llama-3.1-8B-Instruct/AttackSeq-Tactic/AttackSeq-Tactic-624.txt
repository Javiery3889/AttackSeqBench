Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions an adversary exploring the target network to locate relevant systems using Discovery for their mission. This indicates that the adversary has already used the Discovery tactic to gather information about the target network.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Credential Access - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to obtain valid credentials to access the target network. While this could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the discovery of relevant systems.
- B: Discovery - This is the tactic mentioned in the question, but it's not the next step in the sequence. The question asks for the next tactic.
- C: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves the adversary moving within the network to access other systems. Given that the adversary has already discovered relevant systems, lateral movement is a plausible next step to access those systems.
- D: Execution - This tactic involves the adversary executing malware or other malicious code on the target system. While this could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the discovery of relevant systems.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The adversary used Discovery to explore the target network and locate relevant systems.
2. The next logical step would be to access those systems, which is achieved through Lateral Movement.
3. Lateral Movement allows the adversary to move within the network to access other systems, which is a direct continuation of the discovery process.

Final Answer: C
