Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes the Darkhotel APT gaining initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates for hotel guests.
- The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay.

Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts (e.g., names and places of stay)
  2. Gaining initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates

Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:
- A: Resource Development: This tactic involves creating or acquiring tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to support an attack. It does not directly involve obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
- B: Reconnaissance: This tactic involves gathering information about a target, which can include gathering information about the target's location, names, and other details. This seems to align with the first step in the sequence.
- C: Initial Access: This tactic involves gaining access to a target's system or network. While it is related to the second step in the sequence, it does not involve obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
- D: Command and Control: This tactic involves establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. It is not related to obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
2. The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with obtaining this information.
3. Among the answer choices, only B: Reconnaissance directly involves gathering information about a target, which includes obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.

Final Answer: B
