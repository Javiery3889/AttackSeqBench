Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the execution of malicious macros to deliver initial payloads for configuring the Remote Manipulator System (RMS).
- The next step in the sequence is the modification of registry keys to enable the RMS executable's launch upon user login.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question focuses on the persistence of the attack, as the attacker is modifying registry keys to ensure the RMS executable launches automatically upon user login.
- This action is a classic example of an attacker attempting to maintain access to the system over time.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial step involves the execution of malicious macros to deliver payloads, which is a form of Execution (T1202).
2. The next step involves modifying registry keys to enable the RMS executable's launch upon user login, which is a form of Persistence (T1547).

Based on the sequence of events described, the most likely tactic that followed the modification of registry keys is Persistence, as it aligns with the attacker's goal of maintaining access to the system over time.

Final Answer: B
