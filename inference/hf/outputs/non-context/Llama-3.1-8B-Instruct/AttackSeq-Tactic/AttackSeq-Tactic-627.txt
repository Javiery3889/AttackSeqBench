Analyzing the question: 
- The question mentions that the attacker has already established command and control channels, which implies that the attacker has a means to communicate with the compromised network.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Option B, Command and Control, is already mentioned in the question as something that has been established, so it's not the next step in the attack sequence.
- Option D, Defense Evasion, is a tactic used to evade detection, but it doesn't directly relate to the completion of the mission.
- Option C, Collection, is a tactic that involves gathering information, which could be a part of the mission, but it's not the most likely next step after establishing command and control channels.
- Option A, Exfiltration, is a tactic that involves extracting data from the compromised network, which is a logical next step after establishing command and control channels to maintain communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has established command and control channels, which means they have a means to communicate with the compromised network.
2. The next logical step would be to extract data from the compromised network, which is the primary goal of the attack.
3. Exfiltration is the tactic that involves extracting data from the compromised network.

Final Answer: A
