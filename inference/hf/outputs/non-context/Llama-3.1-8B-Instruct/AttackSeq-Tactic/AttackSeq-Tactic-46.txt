Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions the collection of information from compromised hosts using UltraVNC.ini and mobile infostealer malware. This suggests that the attackers are gathering information from the compromised hosts.
- The question also mentions sending commands and receiving results through HTTP requests to PHP scripts on their C2 servers, which indicates the use of Command and Control (C2) tactics.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers first collected information from compromised hosts using UltraVNC.ini and mobile infostealer malware. This action aligns with the Discovery tactic, as the attackers are gathering information about the compromised hosts.
2. After gathering information, the attackers would likely use this information to send commands to the compromised hosts. This action aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
3. The Command and Control tactic involves sending commands and receiving results, which is consistent with sending commands and receiving results through HTTP requests to PHP scripts on their C2 servers.

Comparison of Answer Choices:
- A: Initial Access - This tactic refers to the initial entry point of the attackers into the network, which is not mentioned in the question.
- B: Command and Control - This tactic involves sending commands and receiving results, which aligns with the action of sending commands and receiving results through HTTP requests to PHP scripts on their C2 servers.
- C: Exfiltration - This tactic refers to the extraction of data from the compromised hosts, which is not mentioned in the question.
- D: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the compromised hosts, which aligns with the initial action of collecting information using UltraVNC.ini and mobile infostealer malware.

Final Answer: D
