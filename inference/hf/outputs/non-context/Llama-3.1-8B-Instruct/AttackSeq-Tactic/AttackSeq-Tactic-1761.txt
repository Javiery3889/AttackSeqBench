Analysis of the question and its answer choices:

1. The question mentions a sequence of TTPs:
   - Privilege escalation through a 'fileless' UAC bypass
   - Code injection into Notepad.exe
   - Process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process

2. The question asks for the next likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial privilege escalation.

Comparing and evaluating the answer choices:

- A: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the system, which doesn't align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
- B: Privilege Escalation - This tactic is already mentioned in the question, so it's not the next likely tactic.
- C: Command and Control - This tactic involves communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
- D: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security controls, such as process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process, which aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The initial TTP is a 'fileless' UAC bypass, which is a technique used for privilege escalation.
2. After privilege escalation, code is injected into Notepad.exe, which is a common target for code injection due to its widespread presence on Windows systems.
3. The next step involves process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process, which is a technique used to evade detection by security controls, such as antivirus software and intrusion detection systems.

Final Answer: D
