Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions the Lazarus group, which is a known threat actor.
- The question mentions maintaining communication with command and control (C2) servers through backdoor malware.
- The question mentions executing remote commands during the FEIB heist.

Sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Maintaining communication with C2 servers through backdoor malware.
2. Executing remote commands.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Option A: Credential Access - This tactic involves obtaining valid credentials to access a system. The question does not mention obtaining credentials, so this option is unlikely.
- Option B: Impact - This tactic involves disrupting or destroying data, systems, or infrastructure. The question does not mention disrupting or destroying anything, so this option is unlikely.
- Option C: Execution - This tactic involves executing code to achieve a specific goal. The question mentions executing remote commands, which aligns with this tactic.
- Option D: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining a C2 channel. The question mentions maintaining communication with C2 servers, which aligns with this tactic.

However, the question asks which tactic most likely occurred after maintaining communication with C2 servers. Maintaining C2 is a precursor to executing commands, so the most likely next step would be executing those commands.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Lazarus group maintained communication with C2 servers through backdoor malware.
2. This communication is a necessary step to execute remote commands.
3. Therefore, the most likely next step is executing those remote commands.

Final Answer: C
