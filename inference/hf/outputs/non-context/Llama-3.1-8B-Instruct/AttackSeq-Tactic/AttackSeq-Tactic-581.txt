Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions the Higaisa APT group using a JavaScript file to execute 'cmd /c ipconfig' to retrieve IP address information.
- This action involves executing a command to gather information about the system, which is a common tactic in the Discovery tactic of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the execution of the JavaScript file to retrieve IP address information.
2. The action of executing a command to gather information about the system is a key indicator of the Discovery tactic.
3. The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the system, network, or environment, which aligns with the action described in the question.
4. The other options do not directly relate to the action of gathering information about the system.
   - Defense Evasion involves techniques used to evade detection by security controls.
   - Impact involves techniques that cause harm to the system or data.
   - Resource Development involves the development of tools, infrastructure, or other resources used in the attack.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Based on the analysis, the Discovery tactic is the most likely to have occurred before the execution of the JavaScript file to retrieve IP address information.

Final Answer: D
