Analysis of the question: 
- The question mentions the execution of a backdoor (lightSpy) to gain control over an iOS device.
- The attackers then patched Safari and exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2019-8605) to maintain control and evade detection.

Sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Execution of a backdoor (lightSpy)
2. Patching of Safari
3. Exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2019-8605)

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from a compromised system. The question does not mention any information collection, so this is not the correct answer.
- B: Execution - This tactic involves loading, running, or causing code to be executed on a target system. The execution of the lightSpy backdoor is an example of this tactic, but it is not the most likely answer since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the backdoor execution.
- C: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves evading the detection of security tools or other types of detection. Patching Safari and exploiting a vulnerability to evade detection aligns with this tactic.
- D: Credential Access - This tactic involves obtaining sensitive information from a compromised system. The question does not mention any credential access, so this is not the correct answer.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers executed the lightSpy backdoor to gain control over the iOS device, which is an example of the Execution tactic.
2. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the backdoor execution, which is the patching of Safari and exploitation of CVE-2019-8605.
3. These actions are intended to evade detection, making Defense Evasion the most likely tactic.

Final Answer: C
