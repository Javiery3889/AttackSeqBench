Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions the attackers using initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.
- This implies that the attackers have already gained access to the network and are now moving laterally within the network.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Initial Access refers to the initial entry point of the attackers into the network, which is not the scenario described in the question.
- B: Lateral Movement refers to the movement of the attackers within the network after initial access has been gained, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
- C: Command and Control refers to the communication between the attackers and their command and control servers, which is not directly related to the lateral movement described in the question.
- D: Execution refers to the execution of malicious code on the compromised system, which is not the scenario described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the attackers using initially infected servers as a pivot, indicating they have already gained access to the network.
2. The use of the Explosive Trojan to spread manually across the network suggests a lateral movement tactic.
3. Lateral Movement is the most plausible tactic that occurred after the initial access, as it involves the movement of the attackers within the network.

Final Answer: B
