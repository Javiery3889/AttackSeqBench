Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where malware communicates with C2 domains using HTTP connections and specific URIs for commands.
- The malware is sending stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Option A: Impact - This tactic refers to the effects of a successful attack, such as data destruction or disruption of services. It does not directly relate to the transmission of stolen data.
- Option B: Execution - This tactic refers to the execution of malicious code on a system. While the malware is executing commands, the question focuses on the transmission of stolen data, not the execution of the malware.
- Option C: Command and Control - This tactic refers to the communication between the attacker and the malware. While the question mentions communication with C2 domains, it specifically asks about the transmission of stolen data, not the communication itself.
- Option D: Exfiltration - This tactic refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system to an attacker-controlled location. This matches the scenario described in the question, where stolen data is sent to the C2 infrastructure.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes malware communicating with C2 domains, which is a form of Command and Control (C2) activity.
2. However, the question specifically asks about the transmission of stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots.
3. The transmission of stolen data is a form of data transfer, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.

Final Answer: D
