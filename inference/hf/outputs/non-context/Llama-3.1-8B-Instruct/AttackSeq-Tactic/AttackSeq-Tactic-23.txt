Analysis of the question:

1. The question mentions internal reconnaissance using network scanners and other tools within their custom virtual machines. This suggests that the attackers are gathering information about the internal network.
2. The attackers then use ProxyChains and stolen credentials to download PUPYRAT and move via RDP to a Windows server. This indicates that the attackers are using the gathered information to move laterally within the network.

Comparison and Evaluation:

- A: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. While the attackers did conduct internal reconnaissance, this is not the tactic that enabled the use of ProxyChains and stolen credentials to move laterally.
- B: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving within the network after initial access has been gained. The use of ProxyChains and stolen credentials to move via RDP to a Windows server aligns with this tactic.
- C: Resource Development - This tactic involves developing tools or infrastructure to support the attack. While the attackers may have developed custom virtual machines, this is not the tactic that enabled the use of ProxyChains and stolen credentials to move laterally.
- D: Exfiltration - This tactic involves stealing data from the target environment. The question does not mention any data being stolen, so this is not the correct answer.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The attackers conducted internal reconnaissance to gather information about the network.
2. They used the gathered information to move laterally within the network using ProxyChains and stolen credentials.
3. The most likely tactic that enabled this lateral movement is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: B
