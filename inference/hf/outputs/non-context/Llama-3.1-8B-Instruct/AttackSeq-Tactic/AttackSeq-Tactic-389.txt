Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where VBA macros in malicious Word documents are executed, and then the scripts from the watering hole attacks communicate with external servers.

Identified TTPs:
- Execution: The execution of VBA macros within malicious Word documents.
- Communication with external servers: This is likely a Command and Control (C2) activity, where the attackers are establishing a connection with their command and control servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Execution - This is the initial action, but it's not the tactic that occurred when the scripts began communicating with external servers.
- B: Impact - This tactic refers to the effects of a successful attack, not the communication with external servers.
- C: Command and Control - This is the most likely tactic, as the communication with external servers is a key aspect of establishing a command and control channel for the attackers to control the compromised systems.
- D: Initial Access - This tactic refers to the initial entry point of the attack, which is the execution of the VBA macros, but not the communication with external servers.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial action is the execution of VBA macros within malicious Word documents.
2. The next step is the communication with external servers, which is a key aspect of establishing a command and control channel.
3. Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred when the scripts from the watering hole attacks began communicating with external servers is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
