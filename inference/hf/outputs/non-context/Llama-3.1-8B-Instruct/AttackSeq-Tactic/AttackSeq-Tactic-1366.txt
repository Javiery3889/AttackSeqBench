Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions Scote malware, which is known to evade detection.
- The malware retrieves information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts to establish communications with its servers.

Identified TTPs:
- Evasion of detection
- Retrieval of information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts
- Establishing communications with servers

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Defense Evasion - This choice aligns with the initial action of the malware evading detection. However, it does not cover the subsequent actions of retrieving information and establishing communications.
- B: Reconnaissance - This choice does not fit as the malware is not gathering information about the target system or network.
- C: Command and Control (C2) - This choice aligns with the final action of the malware establishing communications with its servers, which is a key aspect of C2.
- D: Exfiltration - This choice does not fit as the malware is not transferring data out of the system, but rather establishing communications.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The malware first evades detection, which aligns with Defense Evasion.
2. However, the subsequent actions of retrieving information and establishing communications are more closely related to Command and Control (C2) tactics.
3. Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Defense Evasion followed by Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
