Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28, a known threat actor. 
- The sequence involves scanning for vulnerabilities, identifying potential targets, and then executing a second-stage component to take control of the victim's machine.

Identified sequence of TTPs:
1. Scanning for vulnerabilities
2. Identifying potential targets
3. Executing a second-stage component to take control of the victim's machine

Comparison and Evaluation:
- A: Lateral Movement: This tactic involves moving within a network after initial access has been gained. It doesn't fit the sequence described in the question.
- B: Reconnaissance: This tactic involves gathering information about a target before an attack. While it's a precursor to an attack, it doesn't specifically involve scanning for vulnerabilities or identifying targets.
- C: Resource Development: This tactic involves creating or acquiring tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to be used in an attack. It's a broader category and doesn't specifically fit the sequence described.
- D: Initial Access: This tactic involves gaining access to a network or system. It includes actions like scanning for vulnerabilities and exploiting them to gain control of a machine.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes scanning for vulnerabilities and identifying potential targets, which are actions that occur before gaining access to a system.
2. The sequence described in the question aligns with the Initial Access tactic, which includes actions like scanning for vulnerabilities and exploiting them to gain control of a machine.
3. The second-stage component executed by APT28 to take control of the victim's machine is a result of the initial access gained through the scanning and exploitation of vulnerabilities.

Final Answer: D
