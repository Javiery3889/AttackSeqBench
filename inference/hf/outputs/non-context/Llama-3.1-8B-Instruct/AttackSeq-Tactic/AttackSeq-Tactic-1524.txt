Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions Whitefly using encrypted payloads to communicate with compromised systems and download additional tools via multiple configured C&C (Command and Control) domains.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question describes the use of encrypted payloads and C&C domains, which are indicative of Command and Control tactics.
- Command and Control tactics involve an attacker using compromised systems to communicate with their own infrastructure, such as C&C servers, to receive further instructions or to download additional tools.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The use of encrypted payloads suggests that the attacker is attempting to maintain secrecy and evade detection.
2. The use of multiple configured C&C domains implies that the attacker is setting up a communication channel with their own infrastructure.
3. These actions are characteristic of Command and Control tactics, where the attacker uses compromised systems to communicate with their own infrastructure.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
