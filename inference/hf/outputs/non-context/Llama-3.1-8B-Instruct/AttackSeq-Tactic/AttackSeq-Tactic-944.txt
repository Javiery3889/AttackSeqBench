Analysis of the question and its answer choices:

1. The question mentions gaining initial access through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros. This indicates that the initial access was achieved through a social engineering tactic, specifically a type of spear phishing attack.

2. The question then mentions PowerShell scripts being executed to decode and run embedded backdoor components. This indicates the Execution tactic, as the attacker is executing code to achieve their goals.

3. The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Execution tactic.

Comparing and evaluating the answer choices:

- B: Reconnaissance is a tactic that involves gathering information about a target before launching an attack. It is unlikely to occur before Execution, as it is a preparatory step.
- C: Initial Access is the tactic of gaining access to a system or network. In this case, the initial access was already gained through the malicious document, so it is unlikely to occur before Execution.
- A: Execution is the tactic of running code to achieve a goal. Given that PowerShell scripts were executed to decode and run embedded backdoor components, it is likely that this occurred after the initial access was gained.
- D: Lateral Movement is the tactic of moving within a network after initial access has been gained. It is unlikely to occur before Execution, as it is a subsequent step.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The initial access was gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros.
2. The attacker then executed PowerShell scripts to decode and run embedded backdoor components.
3. Given that Execution occurred after initial access, the previous step must have been Initial Access.

Final Answer: C
