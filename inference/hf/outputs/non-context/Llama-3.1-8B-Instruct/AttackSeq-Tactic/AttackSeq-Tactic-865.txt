Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions the execution of "vba_macro.exe" via the Shell command, which is a technique used to execute a macro in Microsoft Office documents.
- The goal is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely ensured that the BlackEnergy dropper would be executed on every system startup.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Reconnaissance (A) is the process of gathering information about a target, which is not directly related to the execution of the BlackEnergy dropper on system startup.
- Lateral Movement (B) refers to the movement of an attacker from one system to another within a network, which is not relevant to the persistence of the BlackEnergy dropper.
- Command and Control (C) involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system, but it does not directly relate to the persistence of the BlackEnergy dropper.
- Persistence (D) refers to the techniques used by an attacker to maintain access to a system over time, which aligns with the goal of ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The execution of "vba_macro.exe" via the Shell command is a technique used to execute a macro in Microsoft Office documents.
2. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK tactic ensures the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.
3. Persistence is the tactic that involves techniques used by an attacker to maintain access to a system over time, which aligns with the goal of ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.

Final Answer: D
