Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an actor to compromise a target's machine.
- The sequence includes social engineering to prompt the target to open a .src file and display a decoy document.
- The ultimate goal is to execute malware on the victim's machine.

Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Social engineering (to prompt the target to open a .src file)
  2. Displaying a decoy document
  3. Executing malware on the victim's machine

Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:
- A: Command and Control - This tactic typically involves the actor maintaining control over the compromised system or network. It doesn't directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question.
- B: Initial Access - This tactic refers to the initial compromise of the target's system or network. While it's a crucial step, it's not the most likely tactic to occur after the described sequence of actions.
- C: Execution - This tactic involves the actor executing malicious code on the target's system. Given the sequence of actions described (opening a .src file, displaying a decoy document, and ultimately executing malware), this is the most likely tactic to occur after the described sequence.
- D: Discovery - This tactic involves the actor gathering information about the target's system or network. It's not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The actor used social engineering to prompt the target to open a .src file, which is likely a malicious file.
2. The actor then displayed a decoy document, which is a common tactic to distract the target and make them less suspicious of the malicious file.
3. The ultimate goal was to execute malware on the victim's machine, which is the definition of the Execution tactic.

Final Answer: C
