Analysis of the question:

1. The question mentions the use of hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files to control KernelBot implants, which indicates the use of techniques for Command and Control (C2) communication.
2. The attackers directed the bots to target Next Media websites, resulting in a 'total failure' of their network, which suggests a disruption or impact on the targeted network.

Comparison and Evaluation:

- **Persistence (A)**: Persistence refers to the tactic of maintaining access to a system or network over time. While the use of hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files might contribute to persistence, it is not the most direct connection to the described scenario.
- **Impact (B)**: Impact refers to the tactic of causing harm or disruption to a system or network. The 'total failure' of the Next Media network suggests a significant disruption, which aligns with the Impact tactic.
- **Defense Evasion (C)**: Defense Evasion refers to the tactic of avoiding detection by security controls. While the use of hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files might be a form of Defense Evasion, it is not directly related to the disruption of the Next Media network.
- **Command and Control (D)**: Command and Control refers to the tactic of establishing and maintaining unauthorized access to a system or network. The use of hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files to control KernelBot implants is a form of C2, but it is not the most relevant tactic in this scenario, as the question asks about the tactic that occurred when the attackers directed the bots to target Next Media websites.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The use of hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files indicates C2 communication.
2. The attackers directed the bots to target Next Media websites, resulting in a 'total failure' of their network.
3. The disruption of the network is the most relevant aspect of the scenario.
4. The tactic that best aligns with the disruption of the network is Impact.

Final Answer: B
