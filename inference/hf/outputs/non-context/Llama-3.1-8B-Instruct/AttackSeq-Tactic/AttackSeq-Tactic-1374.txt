Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of techniques used by an attacker, FIN13, which includes process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Process memory dumping of LSASS and credential harvesting are techniques used for Credential Access (T1003).
- The next step in the sequence involves using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations, which is a technique used for Discovery (T1016).

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial techniques described (process memory dumping of LSASS and credential harvesting) are used for Credential Access (T1003).
2. The next step in the sequence involves gathering information on network and host configurations, which is a technique used for Discovery (T1016).
3. Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations is Discovery.

Final Answer: B
