Analysis of the question:

1. The question describes an attack sequence involving a self-extracting wrapper file, a Gh0st payload, and a custom network protocol. This indicates a sophisticated and targeted attack.
2. The Gh0st payload is a known malware, and the use of a self-extracting wrapper file suggests an attempt to evade detection.
3. The malware established communication using a custom network protocol through its server, which implies a command and control (C2) channel.

Comparison and Evaluation:

- A: Privilege Escalation: This tactic involves increasing the privileges of the malware to perform actions that require higher permissions. While privilege escalation might occur later in the attack, it is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
- B: Defense Evasion: This tactic involves techniques used to evade detection by security controls. The use of a self-extracting wrapper file is an example of defense evasion, but the question already mentions this tactic as part of the initial steps.
- C: Command and Control: This tactic involves establishing a communication channel between the malware and the attacker's C2 server. The use of a custom network protocol to communicate with the server at 98.126.67.114 aligns with this tactic.
- D: Resource Development: This tactic involves the development of new tools, techniques, or infrastructure. While the custom network protocol might be a new resource, the question focuses on the communication aspect, which is more closely related to C2.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The attack sequence started with defense evasion through the use of a self-extracting wrapper file.
2. The Gh0st payload was executed, which likely led to the establishment of a C2 channel.
3. The malware used a custom network protocol to communicate with its server, indicating a C2 channel was established.

Final Answer: C
