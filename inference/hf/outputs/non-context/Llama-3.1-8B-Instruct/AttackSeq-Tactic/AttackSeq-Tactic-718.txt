Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Naikon APT group, including gathering system information and collecting files, screenshots, and metadata using the Aria-body backdoor.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to facilitate communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Option A: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information, which is already mentioned in the question. However, it does not directly relate to communication with the C&C server.
- Option B: Privilege Escalation - This tactic involves increasing the privileges of an attacker, but it is not directly related to communication with the C&C server.
- Option C: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which is also mentioned in the question. However, it does not directly relate to communication with the C&C server.
- Option D: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the C&C server to receive commands and send stolen data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the Aria-body backdoor gathering system information and collecting files, screenshots, and metadata, which indicates the attacker has already gathered the necessary information.
2. The next step would be to send this information to the attacker's C&C server for further analysis and to receive commands.
3. The most logical step in this sequence would be to establish a communication channel with the C&C server.

Final Answer: D
