Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving malicious Excel documents with embedded macros, which led to the employment of a backdoor program that wrote startup items for persistence.

Identification of TTPs:
- Initial access via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros (Tactic: Initial Access)
- Employment of a backdoor program (Tactic: Execution)
- Writing startup items for persistence (Tactic: Persistence)

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Option A (Persistence) is the tactic that occurred after the backdoor program was employed, not before.
- Option C (Credential Access) is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
- Option D (Collection) is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
- Option B (Execution) is the tactic that occurred before the backdoor program wrote startup items for persistence, as it involves the execution of the backdoor program.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial access was gained via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros.
2. The next step in the sequence would involve the execution of the malicious code embedded in the macros.
3. After execution, the backdoor program was employed, which wrote startup items for persistence.

Final Answer: B
