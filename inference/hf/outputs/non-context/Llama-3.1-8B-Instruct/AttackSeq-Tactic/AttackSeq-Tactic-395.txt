- It also mentions the use of GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents to compromise initial systems.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question focuses on the initial compromise of systems, which suggests the initial access tactic.
- The use of region-specific malicious documents implies a targeted approach, which is often seen in initial access tactics.
- The use of GitHub-hosted custom backdoors indicates a method to gain access to systems, which is also related to initial access.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the initial compromise of systems, which is a key aspect of the initial access tactic.
2. The use of region-specific malicious documents and GitHub-hosted custom backdoors is a method to gain access to systems, which aligns with the initial access tactic.
3. The other options, Command and Control, Defense Evasion, and Reconnaissance, do not directly relate to the initial compromise of systems.

Final Answer: B
