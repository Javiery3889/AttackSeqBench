Analysis of the question: 
- The question describes an attack scenario where an attacker gains initial access through a compromised supply chain attack targeting NoxPlayer's update mechanism.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the malware employed defense evasion techniques such as manually loading a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- The question mentions the initial access through a compromised supply chain attack, which is a type of Initial Access tactic.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves the malware employing defense evasion techniques, which is a type of Execution tactic.
- The question asks for the tactic that occurred before the defense evasion techniques, which means we need to look for the tactic that comes before Execution in the attack sequence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial Access is the first step in the attack sequence, which is already mentioned in the question.
2. The next step in the attack sequence is the Execution of the malware, which involves the malware employing defense evasion techniques such as manually loading a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions.
3. Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the Execution, we need to look for the tactic that comes before Execution in the attack sequence.

Final Answer: B: Execution
