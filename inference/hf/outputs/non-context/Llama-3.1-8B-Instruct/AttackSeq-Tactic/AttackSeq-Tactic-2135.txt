Analysis of the Question:
- The question mentions APT15 deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor, which installs persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS to communicate.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the backdoor was deployed.

Comparison and Evaluation:
- Persistence (A) is the correct answer because the RoyalDNS backdoor is described as installing persistently on the victim's network. This indicates that the attacker has achieved persistence, which is a key aspect of maintaining a foothold on the network.
- Resource Development (B) is not directly related to the deployment of the backdoor, as it typically involves creating or acquiring new tools or infrastructure.
- Privilege Escalation (C) might occur after persistence, but it is not the most direct consequence of deploying a backdoor.
- Exfiltration (D) is unlikely to occur immediately after deploying a backdoor, as it typically involves extracting data from the compromised system.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The RoyalDNS backdoor is described as installing persistently on the victim's network.
2. Persistence is a key aspect of maintaining a foothold on the network.
3. The other options (Resource Development, Privilege Escalation, and Exfiltration) do not directly relate to the immediate consequence of deploying a backdoor.

Final Answer: A
