Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an adversary using Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to dump credentials found during the discovery phase.
- The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase, such as local file- and directory lists, in preparation for exfiltration after achieving collection by gathering data from local systems.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that the adversary has already used Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to gather credentials, which is a technique used for credential dumping (T1003).
- The next logical step for the adversary would be to gather data from local systems, which is a technique used for data collection (T1113).
- After gathering data, the adversary would likely prepare for exfiltration, which involves copying or transferring the data out of the compromised system (T1201).

Considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the following:

1. Credential Dumping (T1003)
2. Data Collection (T1113)
3. Exfiltration (T1201)

Given this sequence, it is likely that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase, such as local file- and directory lists, in preparation for exfiltration.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz to dump credentials, which is a technique used for credential dumping (T1003).
2. The adversary gathers data from local systems, which is a technique used for data collection (T1113).
3. The adversary prepares for exfiltration by copying the results of the discovery phase, such as local file- and directory lists, to facilitate the transfer of data out of the compromised system (T1201).

Final Answer: A
