Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Yellow Garuda, a threat actor, collecting data from victims' Telegram accounts using the 'grabber' tool.
- The data collected includes messages, media, group memberships, and contact data.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question does not explicitly mention the exfiltration of data over the web or storage in SQLite database and JSON format.
- However, it is common for threat actors to exfiltrate data for further analysis or storage.
- The mention of the 'grabber' tool suggests a focused effort to collect specific data, which might be exfiltrated for further processing.

Given the context, it is plausible that the data collected by Yellow Garuda would be exfiltrated for further analysis or storage.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Yellow Garuda uses the 'grabber' tool to collect specific data from Telegram accounts.
2. The data collected is likely to be valuable for further analysis or exploitation.
3. Exfiltration of data over the web is a common practice for threat actors to transfer collected data to their own systems for further processing.
4. The data might be stored in a format like SQLite database and JSON for easier analysis and manipulation.

Final Answer: A
