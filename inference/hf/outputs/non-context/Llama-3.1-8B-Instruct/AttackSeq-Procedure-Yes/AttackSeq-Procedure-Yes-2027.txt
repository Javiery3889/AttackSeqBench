Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the Duke group using Seaduke for secure communication with a command-and-control server, employing multiple layers of encryption and encoding.
- The question asks if it is likely that they will exfiltrate sensitive data to legitimate cloud services using Seaduke for Exfiltration.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The use of Seaduke for secure communication with a command-and-control server suggests that the attackers are using a tool for both command and control (C2) and potentially other malicious activities.
- Exfiltration is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by attackers to transfer stolen data out of the compromised environment.
- Given that Seaduke is already being used for secure communication with a C2 server, it is plausible that the attackers would use the same tool for exfiltration, especially if it supports multiple functions.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers are using Seaduke for secure communication with a C2 server, indicating a level of sophistication and the use of a multi-purpose tool.
2. Exfiltration is a common TTP used by attackers to transfer stolen data out of the compromised environment.
3. Given that Seaduke is already being used for C2, it is plausible that the attackers would use the same tool for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
