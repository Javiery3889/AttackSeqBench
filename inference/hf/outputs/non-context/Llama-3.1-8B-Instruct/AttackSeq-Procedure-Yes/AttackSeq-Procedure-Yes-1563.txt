Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where the Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, which is a known incident.
- The question asks if it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 (Command and Control) server using a protocol for further exploitation.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Sunburst backdoor is a sophisticated malware that was used in the 2020 SolarWinds supply-chain attack.
- The primary purpose of the Sunburst backdoor is to provide initial access to the compromised network and establish a foothold for further exploitation.
- After initial access, the backdoor typically communicates with its C2 server to receive additional instructions and payloads for further exploitation.

Given the nature of the Sunburst backdoor and its purpose, it is highly likely that it will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, which is a known incident.
2. The primary purpose of the Sunburst backdoor is to provide initial access and establish a foothold for further exploitation.
3. After initial access, the backdoor typically communicates with its C2 server to receive additional instructions and payloads for further exploitation.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

Final Answer: A
