Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions TG1021 employing a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation. This indicates that the attacker is using a specific type of tool for a specific purpose (privilege escalation).

- The question asks if it is likely that the attacker demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Potato family tools are known for their ability to maintain persistence on the system, often by creating disk-resident tools. If TG1021 employed a custom version of these tools, it is likely that they would want to maintain persistence on the system to continue their malicious activities.

- Defense evasion strategies often involve removing or deleting tools to avoid detection. However, if the tools are disk-resident, removing them would likely compromise the attacker's ability to maintain persistence and continue their malicious activities.

- Given the nature of the Potato family tools, it is unlikely that TG1021 would remove all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy, as this would compromise their ability to maintain persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Potato family tools are known for maintaining persistence on the system.
2. If TG1021 employed a custom version of these tools, they would likely want to maintain persistence.
3. Removing all disk-resident tools would compromise their ability to maintain persistence.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that TG1021 would remove all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

Final Answer: B
