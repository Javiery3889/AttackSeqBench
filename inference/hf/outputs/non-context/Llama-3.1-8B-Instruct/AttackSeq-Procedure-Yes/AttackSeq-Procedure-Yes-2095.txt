Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents using the remote template technique.
- The sequence also mentions exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool to initiate a multi-stage infection chain.
- Finally, it mentions creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The remote template technique is a known tactic used in phishing attacks to deliver malicious payloads.
- Exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities is a known technique used by attackers to deliver malware, and RoyalRoad is a tool associated with this type of exploitation.
- Creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence is a common tactic used by attackers to ensure continued access to the compromised system.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible next step after exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool would be to maintain persistence on the compromised system. This is because the exploitation of Equation Editor vulnerabilities is typically used to deliver malware, and creating a scheduled task is a common method for maintaining persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers use spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents employing the remote template technique to gain initial access.
2. The attackers exploit Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool to initiate a multi-stage infection chain, which likely delivers malware to the compromised system.
3. To maintain persistence, the attackers create a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to ensure continued access to the compromised system.

Final Answer: A
