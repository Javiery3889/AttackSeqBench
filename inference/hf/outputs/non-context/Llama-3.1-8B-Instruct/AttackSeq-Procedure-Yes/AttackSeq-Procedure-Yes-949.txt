Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs related to a Collection phase, which is part of the Reconnaissance or Initial Access phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
  1. Using malware to scan for files and stage data for exfiltration.
  2. Sending data to a primary C&C server over commonly used ports.
  3. Fallback to a C&C server embedded in the configuration.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a sequence of actions where the attacker first uses malware to collect data, then sends it to a primary C&C server, and finally, if the primary server is not operational, uses a fallback C&C server.
- This sequence aligns with a typical communication flow in a C2 (Command and Control) operation, where the attacker would first try to establish a connection with the primary C2 server and then switch to a secondary or fallback server if the primary one is unavailable.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker uses malware to scan for files and stage data for exfiltration, which is a common tactic in the Collection phase.
2. The next logical step would be to send the collected data to a C2 server for further instructions or exfiltration.
3. If the primary C2 server is not operational, the attacker would likely have a fallback plan in place, which is to use a secondary or embedded C2 server.

Final Answer: A
