Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker to gain initial access and establish persistence on a system.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document.
  2. The document contains an auto-open VBA macro.
  3. The VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper.
  4. The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
  - The use of 'mshta.exe' to execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL is a known technique used by attackers to download and execute malware.
  - Creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours is a common method for establishing persistence.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible.
  - However, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with known attack patterns and techniques used by attackers.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial access is gained through a phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document, which is a common technique used by attackers.
2. The document contains an auto-open VBA macro, which is a common method for executing malicious code.
3. The VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper, which is a known technique used by attackers to download and execute malware.
4. The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours, which is a common method for establishing persistence.

Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and consistent with known attack patterns and techniques used by attackers.

Final Answer: A
