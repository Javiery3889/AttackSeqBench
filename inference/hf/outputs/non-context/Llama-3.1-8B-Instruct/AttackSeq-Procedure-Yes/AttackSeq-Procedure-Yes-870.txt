Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving spearphishing emails and compromising public-facing web servers to gain initial access.
- The question then asks if GreyEnergy is likely to implement stealth techniques to hinder analysis and detection.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- GreyEnergy is a known threat actor group known for their advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- Their TTPs often involve using spearphishing and exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing web servers to gain initial access.
- After gaining access, GreyEnergy is known to use fileless malware and encryption to evade detection and hinder analysis.

Considering the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice aligns with GreyEnergy's known TTPs, which include using fileless malware and encryption to evade detection.
- B: No - This choice does not align with GreyEnergy's known TTPs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. GreyEnergy is known to use spearphishing and exploiting public-facing web servers to gain initial access.
2. After gaining access, they use stealth techniques to hinder analysis and detection.
3. Fileless malware and encryption are known stealth techniques used by GreyEnergy.
4. Therefore, it is likely that GreyEnergy would implement these techniques.

Final Answer: A
