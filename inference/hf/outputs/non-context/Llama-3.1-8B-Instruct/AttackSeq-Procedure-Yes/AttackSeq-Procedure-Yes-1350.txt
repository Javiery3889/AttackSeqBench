Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to gain initial access by exploiting CVE-2015-5119.
- The attack involves a Flash file named 'show.swf' and a GIF image with a payload.
- The question asks if the Flash file will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a multi-stage attack where the initial access is gained through the exploitation of CVE-2015-5119 in the Flash file 'show.swf'.
- The next step in the attack is the execution of shellcode, which is a common technique for Defense Evasion.
- The shellcode is then expected to install a payload embedded in a GIF image.

Given the sequence of events, it is logical that the shellcode would be executed before the payload is installed. This is because the shellcode is likely used to create a temporary environment or to bypass security controls before the actual payload is deployed.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attack starts with a spear-phishing email that exploits CVE-2015-5119 in the Flash file 'show.swf' to gain initial access.
2. The next step is the execution of shellcode, which is a common technique for Defense Evasion.
3. The shellcode is executed to create a temporary environment or to bypass security controls.
4. After the shellcode is executed, the payload embedded in the GIF image is installed.

Final Answer: A
