Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where malware uses the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to gather system information and process lists. This suggests that the malware is attempting to gather information about the compromised system.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The use of the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command is a reconnaissance tactic, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This is often followed by the establishment of a command and control (C2) channel for further communication and potential lateral movement.
- HTTPS communication is a common method for establishing a secure C2 channel, as it provides encryption and can help evade detection by network security controls.

However, the question does not provide information about the malware's communication methods after the initial reconnaissance. Given the context, it is possible that the malware could use various communication methods, including HTTPS, depending on the attacker's goals and the malware's design.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The malware uses the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to gather system information, which is a reconnaissance tactic.
2. This initial step is often followed by the establishment of a C2 channel for further communication and potential lateral movement.
3. HTTPS communication is a common method for establishing a secure C2 channel, but it is not the only possible method.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its C2 operations. However, considering the common practices in cyber attacks, it is a plausible possibility.

Final Answer: B
