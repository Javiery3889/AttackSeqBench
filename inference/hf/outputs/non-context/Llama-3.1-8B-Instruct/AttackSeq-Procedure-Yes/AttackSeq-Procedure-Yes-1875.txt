Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions FIN13 using utilities like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and executing a passive backdoor called BLUEAGAVE for command execution.
- The question asks if FIN13 is likely to exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- FIN13 is a financially motivated threat group known for its use of various tools and techniques to gain initial access and maintain persistence in victim networks.
- ProcDump is a utility used to dump the memory of the LSASS process, which can be used to extract sensitive information such as credentials.
- BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that can be used for command execution, indicating that FIN13 is attempting to maintain a level of persistence and control over the compromised system.
- Exploiting external servers and deploying web shells are common tactics used by FIN13 to establish initial access into victim networks.

Given the information, it is likely that FIN13 would exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks, as this aligns with their known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. FIN13 uses ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory, indicating an attempt to extract sensitive information.
2. The use of BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor suggests an attempt to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
3. Given FIN13's known TTPs, it is likely they would use external servers and web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.
