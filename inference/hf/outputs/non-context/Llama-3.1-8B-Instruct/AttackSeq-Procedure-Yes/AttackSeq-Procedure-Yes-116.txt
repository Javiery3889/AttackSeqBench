Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker:
  1. Exploiting public-facing applications to upload webshells.
  2. Using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for lateral movement.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' would be used to exfiltrate data to C2 (Command and Control) servers as part of its execution functionality.

Given the context, 'IPsec Helper' is a backdoor that is known to be used for data exfiltration. It is a tool that can be used to exfiltrate data from a compromised system to a C2 server. 

Considering the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is logical that after gaining access to the system through webshells and using RDP for lateral movement, the attacker would use a tool like 'IPsec Helper' to exfiltrate data to their C2 servers.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker gains access to the system by exploiting public-facing applications to upload webshells.
2. The attacker uses RDP for lateral movement to move within the network.
3. The attacker would then use a tool like 'IPsec Helper' to exfiltrate data from the compromised system to their C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
