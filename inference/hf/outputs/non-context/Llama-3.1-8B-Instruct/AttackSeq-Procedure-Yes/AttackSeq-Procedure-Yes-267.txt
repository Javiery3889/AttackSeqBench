Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by attackers:
  1. Defense Evasion: Ensuring the RAT payload remains in memory without touching the disk.
  2. Process Injection: Injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process.
  3. Command and Control (C2): Connecting the RAT back to its control server.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The first two TTPs (Defense Evasion and Process Injection) are used to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- The third TTP (C2) is a common step in the attack chain where the attackers establish communication with their command and control server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

Given the context, it is likely that the attackers would attempt to connect the RAT back to its control server after injecting the payload into a new process. This is a typical step in the attack sequence to maintain control over the compromised system.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have successfully injected the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process, indicating they have established a foothold on the system.
2. To maintain control over the system and receive further instructions, the attackers would need to establish a C2 channel with their control server.
3. The control server is associated with the domain chickenkiller.com, which is likely a free dynamic DNS service used for C2 communication.

Final Answer: A
