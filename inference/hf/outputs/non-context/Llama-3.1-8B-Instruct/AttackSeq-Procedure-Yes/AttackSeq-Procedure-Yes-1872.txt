Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions FIN13 exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK for Initial Access.
- It then asks if Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by FIN13:
  1. Initial Access: Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK).
  2. Reconnaissance: Gathering victim network information.
  3. Execution: Employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- Answer A: Yes. This choice suggests that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.
- Answer B: No. This choice suggests that Mandiant will not track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by FIN13, starting with Initial Access and potentially moving to Reconnaissance and Execution.
2. The Reconnaissance phase is a common step in the attack lifecycle, where threat actors gather information about the victim's network.
3. Employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution is a plausible next step after gathering network information.
4. Mandiant, as a threat intelligence organization, would likely track and analyze the TTPs used by FIN13, including the Reconnaissance phase.

Final Answer: A
