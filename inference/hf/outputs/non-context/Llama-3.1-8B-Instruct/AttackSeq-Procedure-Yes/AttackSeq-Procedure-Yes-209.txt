Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the use of SparrowDoor for communication with a C&C server using HTTPS and multi-byte XOR keys for encrypted communications.
- It asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- SparrowDoor is a known malware that uses HTTPS to communicate with its C&C server and employs encryption for secure communication.
- FamousSparrow is another malware that utilizes SparrowDoor for its operations.
- Given that SparrowDoor is used for communication and encryption, it is reasonable to assume that FamousSparrow would utilize SparrowDoor for data exfiltration as well, as it is a part of its operational infrastructure.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. SparrowDoor is used for communication with the C&C server.
2. SparrowDoor employs encryption for secure communication.
3. FamousSparrow utilizes SparrowDoor for its operations.
4. Given that SparrowDoor is used for communication and encryption, it is likely that FamousSparrow would use SparrowDoor for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
