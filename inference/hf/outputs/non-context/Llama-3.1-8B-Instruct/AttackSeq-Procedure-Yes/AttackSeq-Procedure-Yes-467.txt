Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access.
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will develop Bankshot implants with capabilities to give full control and wipe files under the tactic of Resource Development.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The initial access is gained through exploitation of CVE-2018-4878, which is a known vulnerability in Equation Editor in Microsoft Office.
- The attackers are likely to use this initial access to develop further capabilities, which is a common tactic in the Resource Development phase of the attack.
- Bankshot is a known implant associated with Hidden Cobra (also known as Lazarus Group), which is a sophisticated threat actor known for its advanced capabilities and tactics.
- The capabilities mentioned (full control and wiping files) are consistent with the tactics and techniques used by Hidden Cobra.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have gained initial access through a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878.
2. This initial access is likely to be used to develop further capabilities, which is a common tactic in the Resource Development phase.
3. Bankshot is a known implant associated with Hidden Cobra, and it is likely that they would use this initial access to develop Bankshot implants.
4. The capabilities mentioned (full control and wiping files) are consistent with the tactics and techniques used by Hidden Cobra.

Final Answer: A
