Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Gamaredon, which is a known threat actor group.
- The question describes Gamaredon using an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets.
- The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Gamaredon is known for its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly in the "Lateral Movement" and "Collection" categories.
- The use of Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement is consistent with Gamaredon's TTPs.
- Deploying scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents is a common technique used by threat actors for collection activities, which aligns with Gamaredon's known TTPs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Gamaredon is known for using VBA macros for lateral movement, which is a technique used to move within a network.
2. The use of VBA macros for lateral movement is a precursor to further activities, such as collection.
3. Collection activities typically involve gathering sensitive information, which can be achieved by scanning for sensitive documents.
4. Deploying scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents is a plausible next step in Gamaredon's collection activities.

Final Answer: A
