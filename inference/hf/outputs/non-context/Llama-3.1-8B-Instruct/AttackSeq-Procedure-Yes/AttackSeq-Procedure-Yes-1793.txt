Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by the OceanLotus Group:
  1. Harvesting credentials using the Mimikatz tool
  2. Credential dumping on compromised machines
  3. Using stolen credentials
  4. Pass-the-ticket technique
  5. Pass-the-hash technique
  6. Executing data exfiltration through a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the typical tactics used by the OceanLotus Group, which is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks.
- The use of Mimikatz for credential harvesting and credential dumping is consistent with the group's tactics.
- The subsequent use of stolen credentials, pass-the-ticket, and pass-the-hash techniques is also consistent with the group's lateral movement and privilege escalation tactics.
- Finally, the execution of data exfiltration through a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook is consistent with the group's data exfiltration tactics.
