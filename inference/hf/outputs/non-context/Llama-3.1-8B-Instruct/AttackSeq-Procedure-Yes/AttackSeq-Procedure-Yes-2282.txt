Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker, likely Regin, which is a sophisticated malware known for its complex and modular design.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
  1. Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
  2. Scanning for deleted files.
  3. Monitoring network traffic to Microsoft IIS web servers.
  4. Crawling through the file system.
  5. Gathering computer information for collection.
  6. Encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Regin is known for its sophisticated and modular design, allowing it to perform various tasks, including data collection, lateral movement, and exfiltration.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the capabilities and behavior of Regin malware.
- The TTPs mentioned in the question are consistent with the tactics and techniques used by Regin to gather information, move laterally, and exfiltrate data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The first TTP, gathering information on processes and memory utilization, is consistent with Regin's data collection capabilities.
2. Scanning for deleted files and monitoring network traffic to Microsoft IIS web servers are also consistent with Regin's data collection and reconnaissance capabilities.
3. Crawling through the file system and gathering computer information for collection are typical of Regin's lateral movement and data collection tactics.
4. Encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration is consistent with Regin's data exfiltration capabilities.

Final Answer: A
