Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Taidoor malware using a downloader to decrypt a modified version of itself.
- The question asks if the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the command-and-control (C2) servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Taidoor is a known malware family that uses various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to evade detection and establish communication with C2 servers.
- The use of a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware suggests that the attackers are attempting to evade detection by making the malware appear as a new or unknown variant.
- Typically, malware variants that use this technique aim to maintain communication with their C2 servers to receive further instructions or updates.

Given the context, it is likely that the new Taidoor variant will attempt to communicate with the specified C2 servers to receive further instructions or updates.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Taidoor malware is known to use various TTPs to evade detection.
2. The use of a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware is a common technique used by Taidoor to evade detection.
3. The goal of this technique is to make the malware appear as a new or unknown variant, which would allow it to avoid detection by traditional security measures.
4. To maintain its functionality and receive further instructions or updates, the malware would need to communicate with its C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
