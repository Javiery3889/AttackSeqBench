Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used in a phishing attack:
  1. Spear phishing emails are sent to recipients.
  2. The emails contain links to RTF documents.
  3. The RTF documents exploit CVE-2017-8750.
  4. The exploitation leads to the delivery of QuasarRAT.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if, after the initial exploitation, the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected with QuasarRAT.
- This implies an additional step in the attack sequence, which is likely a social engineering tactic to further deceive the target user.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice suggests that the attackers will use a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report as a decoy to further deceive the target user before delivering QuasarRAT.
- B: No - This choice suggests that the attackers will directly deliver QuasarRAT after exploiting CVE-2017-8750 without any additional social engineering tactics.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 is used to deliver QuasarRAT, which is a remote access Trojan (RAT).
2. RATs are often used for long-term access and control of the compromised system, which implies that the attackers want to maintain persistence and control over the system.
3. To achieve this, attackers often use social engineering tactics to further deceive the target user and maintain their trust, making them more likely to follow additional malicious instructions.
4. Presenting a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report is a common social engineering tactic used to deceive users into performing certain actions or downloading additional malware.

Final Answer: A
