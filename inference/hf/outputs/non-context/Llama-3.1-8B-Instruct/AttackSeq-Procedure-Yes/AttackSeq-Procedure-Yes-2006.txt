Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker:
  1. Reconnaissance: Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods.
  2. Initial Access: Employee-enabled macro execution to install malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 on the network.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the malicious implants will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers after being installed on the network.
- Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, after initial access is gained, the next likely step for an attacker is to establish Command and Control (C2) to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Reconnaissance is used to gather information about the target network and systems.
2. Active discovery methods are used to identify potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
3. Employee-enabled macro execution is used to install malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 on the network.
4. After installation, the next logical step for the attacker is to establish C2 to maintain control over the compromised system.

Final Answer: A
