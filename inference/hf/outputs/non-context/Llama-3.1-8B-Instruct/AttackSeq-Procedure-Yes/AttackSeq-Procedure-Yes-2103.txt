Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of actions involving a loader, anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques, the Defense Evasion phase, the Discovery phase, and a backdoor.

Identifying the sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
  1. Employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques in the Defense Evasion phase.
  2. The loader gathering information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase.
  3. Collecting detailed victim system data and activity through the backdoor.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a logical progression of actions, starting with evading detection, then gathering information, and finally, collecting detailed data.
- The Discovery phase typically involves reconnaissance and gathering information about the victim's environment, which would be a natural step after evading detection.
- The backdoor is often used for collecting detailed system data and activity, making it a likely next step after gathering initial information.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The loader employs anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection in the Defense Evasion phase.
2. After evading detection, the loader would likely gather information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase to understand the environment and potential targets.
3. With the gathered information, the loader would then use the backdoor to collect detailed victim system data and activity.

Final Answer: A
