Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving Powershell, which is a powerful tool for executing scripts, and a C&C (Command and Control) server, which is a common component of malware operations. The question mentions capturing screenshots and executing arbitrary PowerShell scripts, which suggests a level of sophistication and potential for data exfiltration.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a sophisticated attack, likely involving data exfiltration and communication with a C&C server. Leveraging public services and dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection and maintain persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The use of PowerShell for executing arbitrary scripts suggests a high level of sophistication and potential for data exfiltration.
2. The involvement of a C&C server indicates a coordinated attack, likely involving multiple components and tactics.
3. Capturing periodic screenshots implies the attacker is interested in gathering information, which could be used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration.
4. Leveraging public services and dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection and maintain persistence.

Based on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the attacker would likely leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic.

Final Answer: A
