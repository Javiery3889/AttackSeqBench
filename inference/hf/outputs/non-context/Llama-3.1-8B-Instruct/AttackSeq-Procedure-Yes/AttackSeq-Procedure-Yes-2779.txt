Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a phishing campaign by TA453, where an actor-controlled Gmail account impersonated a prominent Israeli physicist.
- The question asks if it is likely that the phishing emails included a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain before presenting a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- TA453 is known for its phishing campaigns, often using social engineering tactics to trick victims into divulging sensitive information.
- The use of a Gmail account to impersonate a prominent Israeli physicist suggests a spear phishing attack, targeting specific individuals with tailored information.
- The goal of the attack is likely to harvest user credentials, which is a common objective of phishing campaigns.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question (link to a TA453-controlled domain followed by a forged Microsoft login page) is consistent with a typical phishing attack flow.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The actor-controlled Gmail account is used to send phishing emails, which is a common tactic used by TA453.
2. The emails are likely to include a link to a TA453-controlled domain, as this is a common method used to redirect victims to a phishing page.
3. The TA453-controlled domain would then present a forged Microsoft login page, which is a common technique used to harvest user credentials.

Final Answer: A
