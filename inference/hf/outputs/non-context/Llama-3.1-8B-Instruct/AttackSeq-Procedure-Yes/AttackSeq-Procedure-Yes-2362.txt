Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, known as FHAPPI, in a phishing campaign.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Phishing email delivery (T1566 - Phishing)
  2. Link to malware hosted on a Geocities website (T1192 - Server Software Component)
  3. VBScript download and execution of a .doc file (T1204 - User Execution)
  4. PowerShell command execution (T1059.001 - PowerShell)

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.
- Given the context, the sequence of TTPs suggests that the attackers have already used a phishing email to deliver malware, which was executed through VBScript.
- It is common for attackers to use PowerShell for further execution after initial execution through other means, such as VBScript.
- Base64 encoding is also a common technique used in PowerShell to obfuscate malicious code.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have already used a phishing email to deliver malware, which was executed through VBScript.
2. Given the attackers' use of VBScript, it is likely that they will use PowerShell for further execution, as it is a powerful tool for executing malicious code.
3. PowerShell is often used to run base64 encoded code, which can be used to obfuscate malicious code and evade detection.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

Final Answer: A
