Analyzing the Question: 
- The question describes a phishing campaign where threat actors send malicious emails with attachments to desired targets.
- The question asks if the threat actors conducted research on the targets before sending the emails.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Conducting research on targets is a common tactic, technique, and procedure (TTP) used by threat actors to gather information about their targets, which can be used to craft convincing emails, such as spear phishing or business email compromise (BEC) attacks.

2. Conducting research on the targets is a common step in preparing for a phishing campaign.
3. This research helps threat actors craft convincing emails that are more likely to succeed.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the threat actors initiated their campaign by conducting research on the targets.
