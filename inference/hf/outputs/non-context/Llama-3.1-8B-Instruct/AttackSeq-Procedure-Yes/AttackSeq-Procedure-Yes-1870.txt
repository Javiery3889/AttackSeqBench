Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions Scote malware employing various techniques to evade detection using legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information.
- It asks if it is likely that the malware retrieves C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts before communicating with C2 servers to accept commands.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that the malware is using legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information, which is a common tactic in evasion techniques.
- Pastebin and Google+ are both legitimate online services that can be used to host data temporarily, making it plausible that the malware could use them to host C2 information.
- The malware would likely retrieve the C2 information from these services before communicating with the actual C2 servers to accept commands.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions evasion techniques, which often involve using legitimate services to host malicious data.
2. Pastebin and Google+ are legitimate services that can be used to host data temporarily, making them plausible choices for hosting C2 information.
3. The malware would need to retrieve the C2 information from these services before communicating with the actual C2 servers to accept commands.

Final Answer: A
