Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions that Regin is likely to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its modular design and ability to gather information from the compromised system. 
- The discovery phase typically involves gathering information about the system, which includes scanning for deleted files and monitoring processes and memory utilization.
- After gathering this information, the next logical step for Regin would be to collect more data, which could involve monitoring network traffic to gather sensitive information.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Regin's discovery phase involves gathering information about the system, which includes scanning for deleted files and monitoring processes and memory utilization.
2. After gathering this information, Regin would likely use this data to inform its next actions, which could include monitoring network traffic to collect more sensitive information.
3. Sniffing low-level network traffic is a common technique used by Regin to gather sensitive information, such as login credentials, encryption keys, or other sensitive data.

Final Answer: A
