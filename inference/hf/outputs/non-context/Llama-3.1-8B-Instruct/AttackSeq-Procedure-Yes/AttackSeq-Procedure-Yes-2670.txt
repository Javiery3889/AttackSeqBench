Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the actions of OceanLotus, a known threat actor, which involves creating a Launch Agent and launching itself as a service from a new location to achieve persistence.
- The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will gather system details and send the information back to its command and control (C2) server using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- OceanLotus is a known threat actor associated with the Chinese APT group, also known as APT41. 
- The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of OceanLotus are well-documented in various CTI reports.
- One of the documented TTPs of OceanLotus is the use of a custom binary protocol for C2 communication, which involves session-based ephemeral keys for encryption.
- Gathering system details and sending them back to the C2 server is a common behavior of many backdoors, including those used by OceanLotus.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. OceanLotus is known to use a custom binary protocol for C2 communication.
2. This protocol involves session-based ephemeral keys for encryption.
3. Gathering system details and sending them back to the C2 server is a common behavior of OceanLotus.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the backdoor will gather system details and send the information back to its C2 server using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys.

Final Answer: A
