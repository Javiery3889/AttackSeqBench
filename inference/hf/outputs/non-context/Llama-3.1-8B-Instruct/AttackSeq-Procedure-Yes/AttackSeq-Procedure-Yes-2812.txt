Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Derusbi malware gathering system information and beacons this data to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via destination port 443.
- It asks if the malware is likely to employ HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Derusbi is a malware known for its use of HTTP beaconing for C2 communication.
- The use of port 443 is a common choice for HTTP communication as it is the default port for HTTPS.
- The mention of obfuscated communication is also consistent with the tactics used by Derusbi to evade detection.
- The specific URL /photos/photo.asp is a common choice for HTTP POST requests in C2 communications, as it is a legitimate-looking URL that can be used to hide malicious activity.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Derusbi malware is known for its use of HTTP beaconing for C2 communication.
2. The use of port 443 for C2 communication is consistent with this tactic.
3. Obfuscated communication is a common technique used by Derusbi to evade detection.
4. The use of a legitimate-looking URL like /photos/photo.asp for HTTP POST requests is consistent with the tactics used by Derusbi.

Final Answer: A
