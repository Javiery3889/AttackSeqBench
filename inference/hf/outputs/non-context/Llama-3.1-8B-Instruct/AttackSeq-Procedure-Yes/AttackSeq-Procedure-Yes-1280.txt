Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving Tropic Trooper, which exploits Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
- The sequence involves downloading and installing an MSI package.
- The question asks if malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The sequence described involves initial access, followed by the installation of an MSI package, and then persistence establishment.
- Typically, after initial access, the attacker would need to execute the malicious payload (in this case, the backdoor's dropper) to establish persistence.
- Establishing persistence would likely occur after the initial execution of the malicious payload.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access is gained through exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities.
2. The attacker downloads and installs an MSI package, which is likely the malicious payload (backdoor's dropper).
3. To establish persistence, the backdoor needs to be executed and configured.
4. The backdoor's configuration file needs to be decrypted and the backdoor needs to connect to the command-and-control servers via SSL for it to establish persistence.

Based on this sequence, it is logical that the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.

Final Answer: A
