Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker:
  1. Spear phishing activities targeting the ASEAN region.
  2. Using a decoy document suspected to be stolen for reconnaissance.
  3. Exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components.
- CVE-2012-0158 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Word that allows remote code execution.
- The malicious components mentioned (wab.exe and wab32res.dll) are associated with the Windows Address Book, which is a legitimate Windows component, but can be used for malicious purposes.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice suggests that the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop the malicious components.
- B: No - This choice suggests that the spear phishing document will not exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop the malicious components.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a spear phishing campaign targeting the ASEAN region with a decoy document.
2. The decoy document is suspected to be stolen, which implies it may contain malicious content.
3. The malicious content is likely to exploit a vulnerability to achieve initial access.
4. CVE-2012-0158 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Word that can be exploited for remote code execution.
5. The malicious components (wab.exe and wab32res.dll) are associated with the Windows Address Book, which can be used for malicious purposes.

Based on the above analysis, it is plausible that the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop the malicious components.

Final Answer: A
