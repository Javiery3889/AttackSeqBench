Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the CostaRicto Campaign establishing communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
- It also mentions the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
- The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP suggests that the attackers are attempting to evade detection by hiding their communication within legitimate traffic.
- The use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges indicates that the attackers are attempting to secure their communication to prevent interception and eavesdropping.
- Given that the attackers have already established a secure C2 channel, it is likely that they will use this channel to exfiltrate data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The CostaRicto Campaign has established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, indicating an attempt to evade detection.
2. The use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges suggests a secure C2 channel for communication.
3. Given the secure C2 channel, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will use this channel to exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: A
