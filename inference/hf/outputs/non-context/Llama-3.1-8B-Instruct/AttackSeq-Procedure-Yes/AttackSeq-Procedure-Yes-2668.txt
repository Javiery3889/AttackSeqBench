Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the OceanLotus backdoor, which achieves persistence by creating a Launch Agent and copying itself to specific locations on the victim's computer.
- The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will then survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control (C2) server.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The described persistence mechanism is typical of a malware that aims to maintain a presence on the system after the initial infection.
- Surveying the victim's computer and sending system information to the C2 server is a common behavior of malware, especially backdoors, to gather intelligence and maintain control over the compromised system.
- Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that the OceanLotus backdoor would engage in such behavior after establishing persistence.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The backdoor achieves persistence by creating a Launch Agent and copying itself to specific locations on the victim's computer.
2. This persistence mechanism suggests that the backdoor aims to maintain a presence on the system.
3. A common behavior of backdoors is to gather system information and send it to the C2 server for further analysis or control.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its C2 server.

Final Answer: A
