Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker:
  1. Initial Access: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
  2. Execution: Running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if SparrowDoor will communicate with the Command and Control (C2) server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.
- Given the context, SparrowDoor is a known malware used by nation-state actors, specifically by North Korea, for espionage and data exfiltration.
- Typically, nation-state actors use encrypted communication channels to maintain operational security and avoid detection.
- HTTPS is a common protocol used for encrypted communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions SparrowDoor, which is associated with nation-state actors known for using encrypted communication channels.
2. The use of HTTPS for encrypted communication is a common practice among nation-state actors.
3. Given the context, it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C2 server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.

Final Answer: A
