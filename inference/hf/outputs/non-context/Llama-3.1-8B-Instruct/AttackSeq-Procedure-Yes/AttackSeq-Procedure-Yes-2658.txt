Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker, Korplug, in a cyber attack. The sequence includes:
  1. Collecting metadata and content from mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.
  2. Communicating with Command and Control (C&C) servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports.
  3. Performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Answer Choice A: "Yes" suggests that Korplug will follow the sequence of TTPs as described in the question.
- Answer Choice B: "No" implies that Korplug will not follow the sequence of TTPs as described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a specific sequence of TTPs used by Korplug, which includes collecting metadata and content, communicating with C&C servers, and performing data exfiltration.
2. The question asks if Korplug is likely to follow this sequence, which implies that the described sequence is a plausible and expected behavior for Korplug.
3. Since the question describes a specific sequence of TTPs, the most plausible answer is the one that confirms this sequence.

Final Answer: A
