Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker:
  1. Employing obfuscation within a VBS script for defense evasion.
  2. Configuring the script to delete itself post-execution.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The first TTP, employing obfuscation within a VBS script, is likely used to evade detection by security software.
- The second TTP, configuring the script to delete itself post-execution, is a technique used to prevent the script from being analyzed or detected by security software after execution.
- The question asks if the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server.

Considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the described TTPs are more related to defense evasion and lateral movement, but they do not directly indicate communication with a C&C server. However, the described TTPs are often used as a precursor to establishing a connection with a C&C server.

Given the information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to establish a connection with the C&C server after the initial defense evasion and self-deletion techniques have been employed. This is because the described TTPs are typically used to facilitate the execution of the malware, which would then likely communicate with the C&C server to receive further instructions.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The VBS script employs obfuscation to evade detection.
2. The script configures itself to delete post-execution to prevent analysis.
3. After these initial steps, the script likely communicates with the C&C server to receive further instructions.

Final Answer: A
