Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker, specifically the Rising Sun implant.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
  1. Initial reconnaissance to gather system and network information.
  2. Communication with control servers via an encrypted channel.
  3. Exfiltration of data, which is obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Rising Sun implant is known to be a type of malware that uses various techniques for communication and data exfiltration.
- The use of RC4 encryption for communication with control servers is consistent with the Rising Sun implant's behavior.
- Base64 encoding for data obfuscation is also a common technique used by various malware, including the Rising Sun implant.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Rising Sun implant is known to perform initial reconnaissance to gather system and network information.
2. The use of RC4 encryption for communication with control servers is consistent with the Rising Sun implant's behavior.
3. The use of Base64 encoding for data obfuscation is also consistent with the Rising Sun implant's behavior.

Based on the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible for the Rising Sun implant.

Final Answer: A
