Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where attackers have already discovered and mapped the organization's internal network using Cobalt Strike beacons and have collected administrative-level credentials.
- This implies that the attackers have gained a foothold within the network and have a good understanding of the internal layout.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Given the information gathered, the next logical step for the attackers would be to move laterally across the infrastructure to expand their reach and maximize the impact of their attack.
- This is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the "Lateral Movement" tactic (T1197), where attackers use various techniques to move from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have already used Cobalt Strike beacons to map the internal network, indicating they have a good understanding of the network layout.
2. They have collected administrative-level credentials, which would allow them to access and control various systems within the network.
3. The next logical step for the attackers would be to use these credentials to move laterally across the network, compromising additional workstations and servers to expand their control and access.

Final Answer: A
