Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an XAgent app that executes itself in the background on iOS 7 devices, hides its icon, and restarts when terminated. This behavior suggests that the app is designed to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- The question asks if the XAgent app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The described behavior of the XAgent app is consistent with a typical malware or spyware's behavior, which often involves collecting sensitive information from the compromised device.
- Geo-location data is a common type of sensitive information that malware and spyware often collect for various malicious purposes, such as tracking the victim's movements or identifying their location.
- The fact that the XAgent app sends the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server suggests that it is designed to exfiltrate the collected data to a remote server for further analysis or use.

Given the described behavior, it is likely that the XAgent app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The XAgent app executes itself in the background on iOS 7 devices, indicating that it is designed to maintain persistence.
2. The app hides its icon, suggesting that it is trying to evade detection by the user.
3. The app restarts when terminated, further indicating its persistence mechanism.
4. The app is likely designed to collect sensitive information from the compromised device.
5. Geo-location data is a common type of sensitive information that malware and spyware often collect.
6. The app sends the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server, indicating that it is designed to exfiltrate the collected data.

Final Answer: A
