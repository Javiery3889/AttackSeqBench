Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions a backdoor used by Dropping Elephant, which downloads encoded blobs.
- These blobs are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
- The question asks if it is likely that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Dropping Elephant is a known malware that uses a backdoor to download and execute additional payloads.
- The use of PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion suggests a sophisticated and dynamic attack, which often involves the use of file-stealing capabilities to collect sensitive information.
- File-stealing capabilities often involve iterating through directories to collect files with specific extensions, such as documents, spreadsheets, or other sensitive data.

Given the context of the question, it is likely that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Dropping Elephant is a known malware that uses a backdoor to download and execute additional payloads.
2. The use of PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion suggests a sophisticated and dynamic attack.
3. File-stealing capabilities are often used in conjunction with defense evasion techniques to collect sensitive information.
4. Iterating through directories to collect files with specific extensions is a common method used by file-stealers to automate the collection of sensitive data.

Final Answer: A
