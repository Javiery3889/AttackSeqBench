Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker:
  1. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction.
  2. Stealing stored passwords and access tokens using techniques like Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion before the credential theft.
- T1107 (File Deletion) is a technique used for defense evasion, which involves deleting files to evade detection or hide malicious activity.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question implies that the attacker has already gained code execution and is preparing to steal credentials.
- Employing T1107 (File Deletion) before credential theft would not be a typical sequence of events, as the attacker would likely want to maintain access to the compromised system to steal the credentials.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has already exploited CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, indicating they have gained access to the system.
2. The next step is to steal stored passwords and access tokens, which requires maintaining access to the system.
3. Employing T1107 (File Deletion) before credential theft would likely disrupt the attacker's ability to maintain access and steal credentials.

Conclusion:
Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is unlikely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion before stealing stored passwords and access tokens.

Final Answer: B
