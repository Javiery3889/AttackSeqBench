Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions 'IPsec Helper', 'Apostle', and 'DEADWOOD' malware, which are all related to the Agrius malware family.
- The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' as part of its data destruction activities.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- 'Apostle' is a wiper malware, which is typically used for data destruction.
- 'DEADWOOD' is also a malware that overwrites files, which is consistent with data destruction activities.
- The question implies that 'Apostle' initially failed execution, but it is likely to be redeployed as part of the attack.
- The 'IPsec Helper' is used for communication with C2 servers, which suggests that the malware is still active and capable of receiving commands.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The presence of 'IPsec Helper' indicates that the malware is still active and can receive commands from C2 servers.
2. The 'Apostle' wiper malware is likely to be redeployed as part of the attack, given its initial failure to execute.
3. 'DEADWOOD' malware is also consistent with data destruction activities, which aligns with the overall goal of the attack.
4. The sequence of events suggests that Agrius is likely to deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' as part of its data destruction activities.

Final Answer: A
