Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CozyDuke malware. The sequence includes:
  1. Execution of CozyDuke by its dropper using rundll32.exe.
  2. Establishing persistence.
  3. Utilizing COM-object hijacking.
  4. Communicating with the C&C server via HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- CozyDuke is a known malware that uses various techniques to establish persistence and communicate with its C&C server. 
- COM-object hijacking is a technique used by CozyDuke to ensure continued execution.
- The question asks if CozyDuke will utilize COM-object hijacking before communicating with its C&C server.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, it is logical that CozyDuke would use COM-object hijacking to ensure continued execution before communicating with its C&C server. This is a common pattern observed in the behavior of CozyDuke.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. CozyDuke is executed by its dropper using rundll32.exe.
2. To maintain persistence, CozyDuke would likely use techniques such as registry modifications or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to ensure continued execution.
3. After establishing persistence, CozyDuke would use COM-object hijacking to ensure continued execution.
4. Finally, CozyDuke would communicate with its C&C server via HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter.

Final Answer: A
