Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker:
  1. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document.
  2. Dropping an HTA file.
  3. Using WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
  4. Executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.
- Based on the provided sequence, the HTA file is dropped after exploiting CVE-2017-11882, and the FinalBot backdoor is executed with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.
- Typically, after a backdoor is established, it is used for further communication with the C2 server, which may involve leveraging a proxy or redirector like webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has already exploited CVE-2017-11882 to drop the HTA file, which suggests the initial infection vector is established.
2. The HTA file is likely used to establish a foothold on the system.
3. The use of WMI to check for antivirus software indicates the attacker is attempting to evade detection.
4. The execution of the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading is a common technique for establishing a persistent and stealthy backdoor.
5. Given the backdoor is established, it is likely that the HTA file will be used to communicate with the C2 server, and webserv-redir.net may be leveraged for Command and Control.

Final Answer: A
