Analyzing the question and its answer choices:

1. The question mentions a sequence of TTPs:
   - Persistence stage: The dropper sends the MAC address and user-id of the poisoned computer.
   - Defense evasion stage: The CEIDPageLock driver connects with one of the C&C hard-coded domains to download the encrypted homepage configuration for tampering with the browser.

2. Evaluating each answer choice:
   - A: Yes - This answer choice suggests that the CEIDPageLock driver will connect with the C&C server to download the encrypted configuration, which is a plausible next step in the attack sequence. The persistence stage has already established communication with the C&C server, and the defense evasion stage typically involves evading detection by tampering with the browser, which could be achieved by downloading and installing malicious configurations.
   - B: No - This answer choice suggests that the CEIDPageLock driver will not connect with the C&C server, which contradicts the typical behavior of a CEIDPageLock driver in a malware attack.

3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The persistence stage has already established communication with the C&C server, which is a common step in many malware attacks.
   - The defense evasion stage typically involves evading detection by tampering with the browser, which could be achieved by downloading and installing malicious configurations.
   - The CEIDPageLock driver is likely to be used for defense evasion, as it is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.

4. Final Answer: 
   Final Answer: A
