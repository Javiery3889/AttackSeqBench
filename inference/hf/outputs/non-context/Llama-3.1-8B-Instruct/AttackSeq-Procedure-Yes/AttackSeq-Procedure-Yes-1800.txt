Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions FireEye observing single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files from DDOS C2 servers.
- It also mentions the attackers targeting websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and causing Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

Identifying the sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
  1. Using single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files.
  2. Launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.
  3. Targeting specific websites (websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong).
  4. Causing a significant impact on the targeted network (Next Media's network suffered a 'total failure').

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Answer Choice A: "Yes" aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files is a technique often used in C2 communication, which is consistent with the observed behavior of the DDOS C2 servers. The subsequent DDOS attacks against specific websites and the significant impact on Next Media's network are also consistent with the described sequence of events.

- Answer Choice B: "No" does not align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. It contradicts the observed behavior of the DDOS C2 servers and the impact on Next Media's network.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files is a technique often used in C2 communication, which is consistent with the observed behavior of the DDOS C2 servers.
2. The subsequent DDOS attacks against specific websites (websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong) are consistent with the described sequence of events.
3. The significant impact on Next Media's network (suffered a 'total failure') is also consistent with the described sequence of events.

Final Answer: A
