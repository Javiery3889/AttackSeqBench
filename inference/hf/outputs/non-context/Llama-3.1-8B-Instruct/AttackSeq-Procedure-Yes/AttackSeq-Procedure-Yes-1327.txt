Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware, specifically during the Collection and Exfiltration phases.
- The TTPs mentioned are:
  1. Collection phase: 
    - Keylogger
    - Screenshotter
    - Clipboard stealer
  2. Exfiltration phase: 
    - Uploading collected information to remote servers via FTP
    - Using stored login credentials
    - Contacting live remote sites

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.
- The TTPs mentioned in the question align with the typical behavior of the CosmicDuke malware, which is known to be a remote access Trojan (RAT) that can perform various malicious activities, including data collection and exfiltration.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. CosmicDuke is a RAT that can collect sensitive information from the compromised system using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
2. The collected information is then exfiltrated to remote servers for further analysis or malicious purposes.
3. CosmicDuke is known to use FTP to upload the collected data to remote servers, and it can use stored login credentials to authenticate with the servers.
4. Additionally, CosmicDuke can contact live remote sites to receive further instructions or commands from the attackers.

Based on the above analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

Final Answer: A
