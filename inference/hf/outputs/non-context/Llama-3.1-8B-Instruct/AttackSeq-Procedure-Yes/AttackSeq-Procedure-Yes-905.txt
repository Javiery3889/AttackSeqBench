Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions "process hollowing," which is a technique used to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage.
- It also mentions "Dexphot," which is a known malware family.
- The question asks if Dexphot is likely to use fileless techniques for defense evasion.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Process hollowing is a technique used to evade detection by hiding malicious code within legitimate system processes.
- Fileless techniques are often used for defense evasion, as they do not create any files on disk, making them harder to detect.
- Given that Dexphot uses process hollowing, it is likely that it would also use fileless techniques to further evade detection and obfuscate its activities.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Dexphot uses process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes.
2. Process hollowing is a technique used for defense evasion.
3. Fileless techniques are also used for defense evasion.
4. Given that Dexphot uses process hollowing, it is likely to use fileless techniques as well.

Final Answer: A
