Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the WinDealer malware, including:
  1. Discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration.
  2. Staging encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer will collect data from removable media and target relevant folders before exfiltrating the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server.

Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the actions described in the question align with the tactics of:
- Reconnaissance (T1588) - Discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration.
- Data Staging (T1560) - Staging encrypted stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.

The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to collect additional data from the system, which is consistent with the tactic of:
- Data Collection (T1005) - Collecting data from removable media and targeting relevant folders.

Exfiltration (T1567) is the next step, which involves sending the collected data to the C2 server.

Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the actions of WinDealer, and it is likely that the malware will collect data from removable media and target relevant folders before exfiltrating the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
