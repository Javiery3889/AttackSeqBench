Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker group called "The Inception" attackers.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Conducting a reconnaissance spear phish
  2. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word
  3. Deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The first TTP mentioned is a reconnaissance spear phish, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gather information about the target.
- The second TTP mentioned is exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word. This is a specific exploit that can be used to gain initial access to a system.
- The third TTP mentioned is deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER, which is a tool used for execution activities, likely to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- Answer A: Yes. This answer choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is plausible, as the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word can be a means to gain initial access, and deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER can be a subsequent step for execution activities.
- Answer B: No. This answer choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible, but it does not provide any alternative sequence of TTPs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Inception attackers conduct a reconnaissance spear phish to gather information about their targets.
2. The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word is a plausible next step to gain initial access to the target system.
3. Deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER is a plausible subsequent step for execution activities, such as maintaining persistence or escalating privileges.

Final Answer: A
