Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions API hooking techniques to evade detection, specifically modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.
- The goal of these modifications is likely to evade detection by security software, which suggests the attacker is trying to remain stealthy.
- The mention of a backdoor configuration implies that the attacker is setting up a means of remote access to the compromised system.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- API hooking is a technique often used by attackers to evade detection and maintain persistence on a compromised system.
- Modifying functions like 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' would allow the attacker to control process creation and network communication, making it harder for security software to detect malicious activity.
- A backdoor configuration typically includes settings for communication with external entities, such as a Command and Control (C&C) server.
- Given the stealthy nature of the attack, it's likely that the backdoor configuration would include measures to secure communication, such as encryption and decryption keys.

Considering these points, it's reasonable to assume that the backdoor configuration would include an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address to ensure secure communication with external entities.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker is using API hooking techniques to evade detection, indicating a stealthy attack.
2. The modified functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' suggest the attacker is trying to control process creation and network communication.
3. A backdoor configuration is being set up for remote access to the compromised system.
4. Given the stealthy nature of the attack, secure communication is likely to be implemented.

Final Answer: A
