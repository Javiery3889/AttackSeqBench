Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a threat actor:
  1. Deploying a JavaScript backdoor
  2. Installing the CARBANAK RAT
  3. Ensuring admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory
  4. Using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT for privilege escalation

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the threat actor will ensure admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory before using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT for privilege escalation.
- The sequence of TTPs implies that the threat actor has already deployed a JavaScript backdoor and installed the CARBANAK RAT, which suggests they have some level of access to the system.
- However, to install a PowerShell RAT using RunPsExec, the threat actor would need elevated privileges, which is typically not available to a standard user account.
- Ensuring admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory would provide the necessary access for the threat actor to execute the RunPsExec command and install the PowerShell RAT.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The threat actor has already deployed a JavaScript backdoor and installed the CARBANAK RAT, indicating they have some level of access to the system.
2. To install a PowerShell RAT using RunPsExec, the threat actor needs elevated privileges, which is typically not available to a standard user account.
3. Ensuring admin privileges on the victim's Active Directory would provide the necessary access for the threat actor to execute the RunPsExec command and install the PowerShell RAT.
