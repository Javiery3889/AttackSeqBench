Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an initial access vector where a Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word through a malicious macro.
- The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies a multi-stage attack where the initial access is achieved through a downloader (Sharpshooter) and a second-stage payload (Rising Sun) is likely to be involved in subsequent malicious activities.
- The Rising Sun implant is often associated with the TTPs of a second-stage payload, which is used to download additional payloads or act as a proxy for further malicious activities.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the use of a Sharpshooter downloader, which is a type of malware used for initial access.
2. The question implies that the Rising Sun implant is involved in the attack sequence, which is typically used as a second-stage payload.
3. Given the context, it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

Final Answer: A
