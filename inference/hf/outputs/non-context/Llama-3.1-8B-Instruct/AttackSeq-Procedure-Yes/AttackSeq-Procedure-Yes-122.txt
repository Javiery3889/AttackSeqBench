Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker, Agrius, to gain initial access, move laterally, and communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server.

Identified sequence of TTPs:
1. Exploiting public-facing applications to gain initial access via vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-13379)
2. Using webshells for tunneling RDP traffic
3. Leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement
4. Communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP

Comparing and Evaluating Answer Choices:
- Answer A: Yes
  - This answer choice suggests that Agrius is likely to use the described sequence of TTPs.
- Answer B: No
  - This answer choice suggests that Agrius is unlikely to use the described sequence of TTPs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question mentions exploiting public-facing applications to gain initial access via vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-13379, which is a known vulnerability. This is a plausible initial step in a cyber attack.
2. The use of webshells for tunneling RDP traffic is a common technique used for maintaining persistence and moving laterally within a network.
3. Leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement is a typical next step after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.
4. Communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP is a plausible method for exfiltrating data or receiving further instructions from the attacker.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is reasonable to conclude that Agrius is likely to use the described sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: A
