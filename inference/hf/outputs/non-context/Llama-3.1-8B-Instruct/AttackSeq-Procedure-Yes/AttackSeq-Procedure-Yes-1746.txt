Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker, TG1021, in a cyber attack.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Using SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance and gather output files during the Discovery phase.
  2. Accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
  3. Dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The first TTP (using SharpHound and PowerSploit) is consistent with the Discovery phase, where an attacker gathers information about the target environment.
- The second TTP (accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB) is consistent with the Lateral Movement phase, where an attacker moves laterally within the network to gain access to more systems.
- The third TTP (dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader) is also consistent with the Lateral Movement phase, as it involves compromising additional servers to maintain or expand the attacker's presence within the network.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is likely that TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by an attacker, TG1021, in a cyber attack.
2. The first TTP (using SharpHound and PowerSploit) is consistent with the Discovery phase, where an attacker gathers information about the target environment.
3. The second TTP (accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB) is consistent with the Lateral Movement phase, where an attacker moves laterally within the network to gain access to more systems.
4. The third TTP (dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader) is also consistent with the Lateral Movement phase, as it involves compromising additional servers to maintain or expand the attacker's presence within the network.
5. Therefore, it is likely that TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.
