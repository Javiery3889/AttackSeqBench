Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers, specifically focusing on the discovery phase and the subsequent actions taken after gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data.

Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence mentioned is: 
  1. Discovery phase (gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data)
  2. Exploiting remote services for lateral movement
  3. Installing additional persistence points on new systems

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question describes a typical attack sequence where attackers first gather information about their target environment (discovery phase), then use this information to move laterally within the network by exploiting remote services (lateral movement), and finally, they establish persistence on new systems to maintain access and control.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. After gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data, exploiting remote services for lateral movement is a logical next step to expand the attacker's reach within the network. Installing additional persistence points on new systems is a common practice to maintain access and control.
- B: No - This choice contradicts the described sequence. It suggests that installing persistence points would occur before lateral movement, which is not a typical sequence of TTPs.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Attackers first gather information about the target environment through the discovery phase.
2. With this information, they can identify potential vulnerabilities and remote services that can be exploited for lateral movement.
3. Exploiting these remote services allows attackers to move laterally within the network, increasing their access and control.
4. To maintain access and control, attackers typically install additional persistence points on new systems.

Final Answer: A
