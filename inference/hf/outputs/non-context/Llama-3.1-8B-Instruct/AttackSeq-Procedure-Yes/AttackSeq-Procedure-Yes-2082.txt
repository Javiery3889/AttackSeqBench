Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker:
  1. Using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
  2. Obtaining capabilities.
  3. RIG EK (Exploit Kit) delivering exploits.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- RIG EK is known to be a type of exploit kit that delivers exploits to victim machines. It often uses malvertising (malicious advertising) as a delivery mechanism to redirect users to its landing page, which contains the exploit.
- The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. RIG EK is known to use malvertising as a delivery mechanism.
2. Malvertising involves redirecting users to compromised websites or advertising pages that contain exploits.
3. The exploits are then delivered to the victim machine, which is the third step in the sequence.

Based on this reasoning, it is likely that RIG EK would use malvertising to deliver exploits before redirecting users to its landing page.

Final Answer: A
