Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker, specifically SideCopy, during the collection phase.
- The TTPs mentioned are:
  1. Deploying modular plugins for file enumeration.
  2. Browser password stealing.
  3. Keylogging.
  - The question then asks if SideCopy is likely to target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The initial TTPs (file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging) are typical of a collection phase, where the attacker is gathering information and credentials.
- Credential access is a subsequent tactic, where the attacker would use the collected information to access the target system or application.
- The mention of GoLang-based file recon plugins suggests a specific tool or technique being used for the credential access tactic.
- SideCopy is known to be a malware family that uses various techniques for credential access, including file-based recon and exfiltration.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial TTPs (file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging) are consistent with the collection phase, which is a precursor to credential access.
2. The use of GoLang-based file recon plugins is a specific technique that aligns with the credential access tactic.
3. Given the context, it is plausible that SideCopy would use the collected information to target Kavach and exfiltrate its authentication databases.

Final Answer: A
