Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where a backdoor installed by attackers exfiltrates data over a C&C (Command and Control) channel using encrypted communication.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Typically, the primary goal of a backdoor is to maintain persistence and allow the attackers to remotely access the compromised system for further exploitation or data exfiltration.
- Shutting down the victim's computer would disrupt operations and impact system availability, which might not align with the attackers' primary objectives, especially if they are interested in maintaining access to the system for future exploitation or data exfiltration.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have already installed a backdoor, indicating they want to maintain access to the system.
2. The backdoor is used for encrypted communication with the C&C channel, suggesting the attackers are interested in maintaining a covert and persistent presence on the system.
3. Shutting down the system would disrupt operations and potentially alert the victim to the presence of the backdoor, which could lead to its removal and loss of access for the attackers.

Final Answer: B
