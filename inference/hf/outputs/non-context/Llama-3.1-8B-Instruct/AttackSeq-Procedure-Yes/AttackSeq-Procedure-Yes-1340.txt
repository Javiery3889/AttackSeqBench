Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving a Flash zero-day exploit, arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, and a second stage shellcode.
- The question asks if the second stage shellcode will then download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests a typical exploit chain:
  1. Initial exploitation (Flash zero-day exploit)
  2. Escalation of privileges (arbitrary read/write memory capabilities)
  3. Execution of a second stage payload (second stage shellcode)
  4. Download and execution of the final payload (FinSpy)
  5. Communication with C2 servers for further control

Given this sequence, it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The initial Flash zero-day exploit gains arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, which is a common step in exploit chains to escalate privileges.
2. The second stage shellcode is typically used to download and execute the final payload, which in this case is FinSpy.
3. After executing the final payload, the attacker would need to establish communication with C2 servers to maintain control over the compromised system.

Final Answer: A
