Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the Rising Sun implant, which performs initial reconnaissance and communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that the Rising Sun implant is using RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for both initial reconnaissance and communication with control servers. This suggests a consistent use of these techniques throughout the attack sequence.
- Given this consistency, it is likely that the implant would continue to use the same encryption and obfuscation methods for data exfiltration to the control server.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Rising Sun implant uses RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for initial reconnaissance and communication with control servers.
2. This suggests a consistent use of these techniques throughout the attack sequence.
3. Data exfiltration to the control server would likely follow the same pattern of encryption and obfuscation used for initial communication.
4. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the implant would use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
