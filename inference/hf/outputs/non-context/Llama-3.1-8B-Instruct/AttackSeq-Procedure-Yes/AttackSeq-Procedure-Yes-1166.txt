Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an initial access vector where an attacker, Longhorn, exploits a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
- The question then asks if it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Vault 7 documents are a collection of leaked CIA hacking tools and techniques, which include methods for evading detection and maintaining persistence on compromised systems.
- Given that Longhorn has already successfully exploited a zero-day vulnerability to gain initial access, it is plausible that they would want to minimize the risk of detection to maintain their presence on the system.
- System fingerprinting for discovery is a crucial step in understanding the target environment and identifying potential vulnerabilities for further exploitation.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Longhorn has successfully exploited a zero-day vulnerability to gain initial access, indicating a high level of sophistication and a desire to maintain stealth.
2. The Vault 7 documents provide a wealth of information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for evading detection and maintaining persistence.
3. Given the high-risk nature of the initial access vector, it is likely that Longhorn would want to minimize the risk of detection to avoid being discovered and removed from the system.
4. System fingerprinting for discovery is a critical step in understanding the target environment, and it is likely that Longhorn would want to perform this step after ensuring they have a low risk of detection.

Final Answer: A
