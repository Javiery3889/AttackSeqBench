Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack campaign called Operation NightScout that uses an Initial Access tactic through a supply chain attack targeting the update mechanism of NoxPlayer.
- The question asks if it is likely that the attack campaign will execute a malicious MFC Dialog application that uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory before employing defense evasion techniques such as manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question mentions the Initial Access tactic through a supply chain attack, which is a common technique used by attackers to gain access to a system.
- The mention of a malicious MFC Dialog application and overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory suggests the use of Living Off The Land (LOTL) tactics, specifically the use of legitimate system tools and libraries to perform malicious activities.
- The use of manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions is a defense evasion technique that is consistent with the use of LOTL tactics.

Given the information provided, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the tactics and techniques used by Operation NightScout.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attack campaign uses an Initial Access tactic through a supply chain attack targeting the update mechanism of NoxPlayer.
2. The attackers execute a malicious MFC Dialog application that uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory.
3. The attackers employ defense evasion techniques such as manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions.
