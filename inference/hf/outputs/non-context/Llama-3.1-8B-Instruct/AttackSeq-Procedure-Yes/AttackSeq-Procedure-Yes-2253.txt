To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mentioned:

1. **Credential Access**: The attacker is using njRAT to target access credentials from Indian government employees. This suggests a specific targeting of sensitive information.
2. **Exfiltration**: The attacker is using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases. This indicates a specific interest in sensitive data related to authentication.

Given these TTPs, let's evaluate the answer choices:

**Step 1:** The question mentions SideCopy, which is a known threat actor. SideCopy is known to target Indian organizations, including government entities. This suggests a specific interest in Indian government employees' credentials.

**Step 2:** The use of njRAT for Credential Access is consistent with SideCopy's tactics, as njRAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) that can be used to steal sensitive information, including credentials.

**Step 3:** The use of GoLang-based file recon plugins for Exfiltration is also consistent with SideCopy's tactics, as they have been known to use various tools and techniques to exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Step 4:** The specific targeting of Kavach authentication databases suggests a focus on sensitive authentication information, which is consistent with SideCopy's interests.

Based on these steps, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with SideCopy's known tactics and techniques.

**Final Answer: A**
