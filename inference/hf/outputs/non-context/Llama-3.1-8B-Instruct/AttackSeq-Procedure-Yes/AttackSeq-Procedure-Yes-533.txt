Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by attackers:
  1. Inserting malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal.
  2. Redirecting victims to an exploit landing page.
  3. Exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
  4. Utilizing heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive.
  5. Executing embedded shellcode payload.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Answer Choice A: "Yes" suggests that the sequence of TTPs is plausible.
- Answer Choice B: "No" suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.

Evaluating the sequence:
- The first step involves inserting malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal, which is a common tactic used in web-based attacks.
- The second step involves redirecting victims to an exploit landing page, which is a common technique used to deliver exploits to victims.
- The third step involves exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, which is a specific vulnerability that can be exploited using JavaScript code.
- The fourth step involves utilizing heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive, which is a common technique used to bypass memory protection mechanisms.
- The fifth step involves executing embedded shellcode payload, which is a common technique used to achieve code execution.

Based on the sequence of TTPs, it is likely that the attackers used the described sequence to compromise the victims' systems.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers inserted malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal to deliver the exploit.
2. The malicious JavaScript code redirected victims to an exploit landing page.
3. The exploit landing page exploited CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
4. The exploit gained an arbitrary read/write primitive using heap spraying techniques.
5. The arbitrary read/write primitive was used to execute embedded shellcode payload.

Final Answer: A
