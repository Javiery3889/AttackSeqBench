Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows, followed by privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
- The question asks whether the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Typically, in a typical attack sequence, the Stager module is used to establish a connection back to the attacker's command and control (C2) server after initial access has been gained.
- The Stager module usually performs tasks such as establishing a connection, uploading additional tools, and preparing the environment for the next phase of the attack.
- The Dropper module is responsible for downloading and executing the final payload, which is the actual malware that further the attack.

Given this understanding, it is unlikely that the Stager module would notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing the Dropper module. The Stager module's primary function is to facilitate the next phase of the attack, which would include the execution of the Dropper module.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Stager module is used to establish a connection back to the attacker's C2 server after initial access has been gained.
2. The Stager module prepares the environment for the next phase of the attack.
3. The Dropper module is responsible for downloading and executing the final payload, which is the actual malware that further the attack.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Stager module would notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing the Dropper module.

Final Answer: B
