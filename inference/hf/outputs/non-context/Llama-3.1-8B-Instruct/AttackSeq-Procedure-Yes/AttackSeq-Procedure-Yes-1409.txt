Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where attackers collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites.
- The next step in the attack sequence is likely to be the exploitation of these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victims' accounts.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question does not explicitly mention the attackers changing passwords or demanding ransom payments.
- However, it is common for attackers to use stolen credentials to gain access to the victim's account and then lock out the original owner by changing the password.
- Demanding ransom payments for the return of the compromised account is a plausible next step in the attack sequence, as attackers often use this tactic to extort money from victims.

However, the question does not provide enough information to confirm that the attackers will demand ransom payments. The most likely next step after gaining access to the account would be to change the password to lock out the original owner.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Attackers collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites.
2. The attackers use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victims' accounts.
3. To prevent the original owners from regaining access, the attackers change the passwords associated with the compromised accounts.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible next step after gaining access to the account is to change the password, not to demand ransom payments.

Final Answer: B
