Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where the FAKEM RAT (Remote Access Tool) controller disguises its network traffic to evade detection.
- The question asks if it is likely that the FAKEM RAT controller will use encrypted network communication with XOR operations for encryption during command and control activities.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Disguising network traffic to evade detection is a common tactic used by attackers to remain undetected (Tactic: Evasion).
- Using encrypted network communication is a common technique used by attackers to protect their communication from being intercepted and understood by others (Tactic: Command and Control).
- XOR operations are a simple form of encryption that can be used to encrypt data (Tactic: Encryption).

Given the context of the question, it is likely that the FAKEM RAT controller will use encrypted network communication with XOR operations for encryption during command and control activities to maintain its stealth and evade detection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The FAKEM RAT controller is disguising its network traffic to evade detection, which is a common tactic used by attackers to remain undetected.
2. To maintain its stealth, the FAKEM RAT controller will likely use encrypted network communication to protect its communication from being intercepted and understood by others.
3. XOR operations are a simple form of encryption that can be used to encrypt data, making it a plausible choice for the FAKEM RAT controller to use during command and control activities.

Final Answer: A
