Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the "Rising Sun implant," which is a known malware variant.
- The Rising Sun implant is known to perform initial reconnaissance by collecting network and system information.
- The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control (C2) purposes.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Rising Sun implant is a type of malware that is known to use various communication protocols for C2 purposes.
- HTTP POST requests are a common method used by some malware variants for C2 communication.
- Given the initial reconnaissance phase, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant would use HTTP POST requests for C2 communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Rising Sun implant is known to perform initial reconnaissance.
2. The initial reconnaissance phase is typically followed by C2 communication.
3. HTTP POST requests are a common method used for C2 communication by some malware variants.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for C2 purposes.

Final Answer: A
