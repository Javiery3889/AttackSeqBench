Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an initial access vector through misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
- The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that the attackers have already gained initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports.
- The use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON suggests a reconnaissance phase where the attackers are likely to gather information about the compromised Docker APIs.
- Deploying malicious containers would be a subsequent step after reconnaissance.

Given this sequence, it is logical that the attackers would use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to detect and gather information about the compromised Docker APIs before deploying malicious containers.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initial access was gained through misconfigured Docker API ports.
2. The attackers would likely use tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance to gather information about the compromised Docker APIs.
3. Deploying malicious containers would be a subsequent step after gathering information about the compromised Docker APIs.

Final Answer: A
