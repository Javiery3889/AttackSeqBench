Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where credentials are being captured from compromised hotel systems and online travel agencies for resale to other cybercriminals. This suggests a credential harvesting or identity theft campaign.
- The specific campaign mentioned is "RevengeHotels," which is known to be a type of attack that targets hotels and online travel agencies.

Identifying the Sequence of TTPs:
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
  1. Credential harvesting (capturing credentials from compromised systems)
  2. Selling the credentials to other cybercriminals

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign will monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data.
- This action (monitoring documents sent to the printer) is more characteristic of a data exfiltration or data collection tactic, which is not directly related to the initial credential harvesting and resale described in the question.

Evaluating the answer choices:
- A: Yes - This choice suggests that the malware will engage in a new TTP (monitoring documents sent to the printer) that is not directly related to the initial credential harvesting and resale described in the question.
- B: No - This choice suggests that the malware will not engage in this new TTP, which is consistent with the initial credential harvesting and resale described in the question.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a credential harvesting campaign (RevengeHotels) focused on capturing credentials for resale.
2. The question asks if the malware will engage in a new TTP (monitoring documents sent to the printer) that is not directly related to the initial campaign.
3. Given the context, it is unlikely that the malware will engage in this new TTP, as it does not align with the initial credential harvesting and resale described.

Final Answer: B
