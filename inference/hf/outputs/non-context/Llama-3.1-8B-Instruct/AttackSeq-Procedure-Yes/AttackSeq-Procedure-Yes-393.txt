Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of actions performed by Vyveva's backdoor, including:
  1. Collecting information such as local IP address and system time through discovery.
  2. Collecting files from newly inserted removable media.
  3. Notifying the C&C about the collected files.
  4. Compressing the collected files.
  5. Sending the compressed files to the C&C server.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer choice aligns with the sequence of actions described in the question. The backdoor first collects information, then collects files from removable media, notifies the C&C, compresses the files, and finally sends them to the C&C server.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer choice does not align with the sequence of actions described in the question. It contradicts the order of operations described.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a specific sequence of actions performed by Vyveva's backdoor.
2. Answer Choice A aligns with this sequence, while Answer Choice B does not.
3. Therefore, Answer Choice A is the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: A
