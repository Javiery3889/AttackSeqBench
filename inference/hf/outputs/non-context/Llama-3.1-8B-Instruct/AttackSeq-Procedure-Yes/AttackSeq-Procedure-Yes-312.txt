Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the BitterAPT group developing BitterRAT malware and setting up Command and Control (C2) servers like blitzchatlog.ddns.net for communication and data exfiltration.
- The question asks if it is likely that the group used compromised websites and phishing schemes to distribute their threats before setting up these C2 servers.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Compromised websites and phishing schemes are common tactics used by threat actors to distribute malware and gain initial access to a target network.
- The development of BitterRAT malware and the setup of C2 servers like blitzchatlog.ddns.net suggest a sophisticated and organized attack campaign.
- It is plausible that the BitterAPT group would use initial tactics like compromised websites and phishing schemes to distribute BitterRAT malware before setting up C2 servers for further communication and data exfiltration.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Compromised websites and phishing schemes are common initial attack vectors for malware distribution.
2. The BitterAPT group's development of BitterRAT malware and setup of C2 servers indicate a sophisticated attack campaign.
3. It is likely that the group would use initial tactics like compromised websites and phishing schemes to distribute malware before setting up C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
