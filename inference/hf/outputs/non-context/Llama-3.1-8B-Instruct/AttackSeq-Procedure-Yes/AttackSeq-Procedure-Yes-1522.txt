Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack where the attackers modified a Javascript file on the Afghan Government's CDN server to deliver malicious code to targeted websites.
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question implies that the attackers have already compromised the Afghan Government's CDN server and modified a Javascript file to deliver malicious code.
- Obfuscation techniques like appending to the existing file and encoding with Dean Edwards Packer are common methods used for defense evasion to make it difficult for security tools to detect the malicious code.
- Given the attackers have already compromised the CDN server, it is likely they would use additional techniques to evade detection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have already compromised the Afghan Government's CDN server, indicating they have a level of access and control.
2. Modifying a Javascript file to deliver malicious code suggests the attackers are trying to remain undetected.
3. Obfuscation techniques like appending to the existing file and encoding with Dean Edwards Packer are common methods used for defense evasion.
4. Given the attackers have already compromised the CDN server, it is likely they would use additional techniques to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
