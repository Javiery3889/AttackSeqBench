Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by the PIVY variant, which includes:
  1. Evasion through DLL sideloading
  2. Modifying the configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The question asks if the malware will communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols after the described TTPs.
- DLL sideloading and configuration modification are techniques often used for initial infection and persistence, but they do not directly indicate communication with C2 servers.
- Application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) are typically used for C2 communication.

Considering the provided TTPs, there is no direct indication that the malware will use application layer protocols for C2 communication. The described TTPs focus on initial infection and evasion, not on communication with C2 servers.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading to evade defenses, which is a technique for initial infection.
2. The malware modifies its configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data, which is a technique for persistence and evasion.
3. There is no indication that these TTPs are directly related to C2 communication.
4. C2 communication typically involves protocols like HTTP or HTTPS, which are application layer protocols.

Final Answer: B
