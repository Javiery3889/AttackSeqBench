Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by an attacker, likely Gamaredon, which includes:
  1. Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
  2. Using a backdoor to list interesting files, specifically Office documents, during discovery.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The described TTPs suggest that the attacker is using a targeted approach to gather information and maintain persistence on the compromised system.
- The use of a backdoor to list specific types of files (Office documents) implies that the attacker is looking for specific types of data or files that are likely to be of interest to them.
- Scanning all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data would be a more general and broad approach, which may not align with the targeted approach described.

Given the targeted approach of the described TTPs, it is less likely that the attacker would engage in a more general and broad data collection activity like scanning all drives for sensitive data.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker is using a targeted approach to insert malicious macros and list specific types of files, indicating a focus on gathering specific information.
2. The use of a backdoor to list Office documents suggests that the attacker is looking for specific types of data or files.
3. Scanning all drives, including network shared drives, would be a more general approach that may not align with the targeted approach described.

Final Answer: B
