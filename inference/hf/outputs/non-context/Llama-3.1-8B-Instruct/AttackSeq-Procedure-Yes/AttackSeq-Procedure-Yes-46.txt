Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a phishing campaign involving emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
- The goal is to determine if the campaign will execute VBS (Visual Basic Scripting) macros from the embedded document after gaining initial access.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Phishing campaigns often involve tricking victims into opening malicious attachments or clicking on links, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
- VBS macros are a common type of malicious code that can be embedded in Microsoft Office documents, such as Word documents.
- The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in this scenario is likely:
  1. Initial Access: Phishing emails with a malicious attachment are sent to the victim.
  2. Execution: The victim opens the attachment, which is the 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
  3. Execution: The document is likely to be a Word document that contains VBS macros.

Given this sequence, it is plausible that the campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The phishing campaign is the initial access vector, which is a common technique used by attackers.
2. The malicious attachment is a Word document, which is a common type of file that can contain VBS macros.
3. VBS macros are often used to execute malicious code, which aligns with the goal of the phishing campaign.

Final Answer: A
