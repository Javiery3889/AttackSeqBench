Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a sequence of tactics: 
  1. Discovery (collecting machine information)
  2. Collection (taking screenshots)
  3. Command and Control (C2) phase

Comparing and Evaluating:
- Typically, in a typical attack sequence, after the initial reconnaissance and data collection phases, the attacker would need to establish a communication channel with their Command and Control (C2) server to send the collected data and receive further instructions.
- The use of a backdoor for data collection suggests that the attacker wants to maintain a covert communication channel with the compromised system.
- Encrypted communication is a common practice for C2 channels to evade detection and maintain confidentiality.

Given these considerations, it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C2 server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase to maintain the stealthiness of the attack.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attacker has already used a backdoor to collect machine information and take screenshots, indicating a need for covert communication.
2. The Command and Control phase typically involves sending collected data to the attacker's server and receiving further instructions.
3. Encrypted communication is a common practice for C2 channels to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
