Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions the Sednit group, which is known to be a threat actor group.
- The question describes a sequence of actions: 
  1. Using malware to scan and stage files for exfiltration during the Collection phase.
  2. Encrypting network traffic with AES or a custom algorithm for secure communication with its C&C server in the Command and Control phase.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Sednit group is known for its sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). 
- In the Collection phase, the group uses malware to scan and stage files for exfiltration, which is consistent with their known TTPs.
- In the Command and Control (C2) phase, encrypting network traffic is a common technique used by threat actors to secure communication with their C2 servers.
- The Sednit group is known to use custom encryption algorithms for secure communication with their C2 servers.

Given the Sednit group's known TTPs, it is likely that they would use a custom algorithm for secure communication with their C2 server, rather than a standard encryption algorithm like AES.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Sednit group is known for its sophisticated TTPs.
2. They use malware to scan and stage files for exfiltration during the Collection phase, which is consistent with their known TTPs.
3. In the C2 phase, encrypting network traffic is a common technique used by threat actors.
4. The Sednit group is known to use custom encryption algorithms for secure communication with their C2 servers.

Final Answer: B
