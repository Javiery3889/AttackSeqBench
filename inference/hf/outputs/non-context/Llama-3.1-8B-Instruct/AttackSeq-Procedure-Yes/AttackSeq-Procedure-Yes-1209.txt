Analyzing the Question:
- The question mentions PyFlash backdoor gathering OS-related information and sending it to the C&C server.
- It asks if NetFlash and PyFlash will utilize ports 80, 8,000, and 15,363 for encrypted communication with their respective C&C servers.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- PyFlash and NetFlash are malware variants, and their behavior is likely to be similar.
- Typically, malware uses specific ports for communication with C&C servers, and these ports are often chosen for their availability and stealth.
- Ports 80 (HTTP), 8000 (a common alternative HTTP port), and 15363 (a non-standard port) could be used for communication, as they are not commonly associated with standard services and could be used for encrypted communication.

However, without specific information about the malware's configuration or the C&C server's setup, it's difficult to determine the exact ports used. But given the context, it's plausible that these malware variants could use these ports for encrypted communication.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. PyFlash and NetFlash are malware variants, and their behavior is likely to be similar.
2. Malware often uses specific ports for communication with C&C servers.
3. Ports 80, 8000, and 15363 are not commonly associated with standard services and could be used for encrypted communication.

Final Answer: A
