Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes an attack sequence involving RIG EK (Exploit Kit) using proxy servers to evade detection.
- The question asks if the exploit server will return encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control operations.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- RIG EK is known for its use of proxy servers to evade detection, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
- The use of proxy servers to evade detection is a common tactic in the initial stages of an attack, often followed by the establishment of a command and control (C2) channel for further communication.
- RC4 is an encryption algorithm that has been used in various malware and C2 channels for encryption.
- A custom version of the RC4 algorithm would be consistent with the attacker's attempt to maintain control and evade detection.

However, RC4 is generally considered insecure and has been largely replaced by more secure encryption algorithms. Given the context of the question, it is more plausible that the attacker would use a custom version of RC4 for simplicity and ease of implementation rather than a more secure algorithm.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The use of proxy servers to evade detection is a common tactic in the initial stages of an attack.
2. The establishment of a C2 channel is a necessary step for further communication and control.
3. RC4 is an encryption algorithm that has been used in various malware and C2 channels.
4. A custom version of RC4 would be consistent with the attacker's attempt to maintain control and evade detection.

Final Answer: A
