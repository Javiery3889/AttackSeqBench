Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes a scenario where Longhorn malware is configured to communicate with a Command and Control (C&C) server over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
- The malware is configured to use a specific domain and IP address combination per target.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.

Identifying the sequence of TTPs:
- TTPs mentioned in the question:
  1. Configuration of a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
  2. Scheduled exfiltration.
  3. Avoiding detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The first TTP (configuration of a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol) suggests that the attackers are trying to maintain a level of stealth and control over the communication.
- The second TTP (scheduled exfiltration) implies that the attackers are trying to exfiltrate data at specific times to avoid detection.
- The third TTP (avoiding detection through upload limits and randomized intervals) further supports the idea that the attackers are trying to evade detection.

Considering these TTPs, it is likely that the malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have configured a custom communication protocol to maintain control and stealth.
2. They have scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.
3. They are using randomized intervals and upload limits to further evade detection.

Final Answer: A
