Analyzing the Question:
- The question describes the Rising Sun implant ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
- It then asks if the implant is likely to perform initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information as part of discovery before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Comparing and Evaluating:
- The Rising Sun implant is a known malware that uses a multi-stage delivery approach to ensure persistence.
- Typically, after ensuring persistence, the implant would perform initial reconnaissance to gather information about the compromised system.
- Fetching network adapter info and IP address information is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack, as it helps the attacker understand the compromised system's environment.
- Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests is also a common method for malware to report back to its command and control (C2) servers.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The Rising Sun implant has ensured persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
2. The next logical step for the implant would be to gather information about the compromised system.
3. Fetching network adapter info and IP address information is a common step in the discovery phase of an attack.
4. After gathering this information, the implant would likely communicate with its C2 servers to report the gathered information.
5. HTTP POST requests are a common method for malware to communicate with C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
