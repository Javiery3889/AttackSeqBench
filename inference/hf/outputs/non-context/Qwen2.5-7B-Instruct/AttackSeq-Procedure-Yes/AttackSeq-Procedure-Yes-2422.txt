Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access and Malicious Payloads:**
   - The attackers used social engineering to gain initial access.
   - They deployed 'Mipko' for keystroke and screen capture monitoring.

2. **Lateral Movement:**
   - The question asks if the attackers likely leveraged captured credentials during lateral movement.
   - 'Mipko' is a known malware that can capture keystrokes and screenshots, which can include credentials.

3. **ATM Withdrawals:**
   - The attackers then coordinated ATM withdrawals using physical mules across multiple cities and countries.
   - This suggests a need for valid credentials to perform the ATM transactions.

4. **Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial access and payload deployment.
   - Lateral movement using stolen credentials.
   - Coordinating ATM withdrawals.

Given this sequence, it is highly plausible that the attackers would use the credentials they captured (through keystroke and screen capture) during the lateral movement phase to perform the ATM withdrawals.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This aligns with the plausible sequence of TTPs described.
- **B: No** - This does not align with the plausible sequence of TTPs described.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
