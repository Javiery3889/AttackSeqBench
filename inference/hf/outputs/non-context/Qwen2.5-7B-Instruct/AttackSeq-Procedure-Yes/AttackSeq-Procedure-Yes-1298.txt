Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
   - Stealing stored passwords and access tokens using techniques like Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry.

2. **Evaluate the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion after the initial exploitation and credential theft.

3. **Analyze Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - File Deletion (T1107) is a technique used to remove evidence of an attack, which aligns with defense evasion. After stealing credentials, an attacker might want to delete logs or other files that could be used to trace the attack.
   - **B: No**
     - This would imply that the attackers would not use file deletion as a defense evasion technique, which seems less likely given the common practice of attackers trying to cover their tracks.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution allows the attacker to gain initial access without user interaction.
   - Stealing stored passwords and access tokens is a critical step to maintain persistence and escalate privileges.
   - After these steps, it is common for attackers to employ techniques like file deletion to remove traces of their activities, making it harder for defenders to detect and respond to the attack.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common practice of attackers using file deletion as a defense evasion technique, it is highly plausible that the campaign would employ T1107 after the described TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
