To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Obtaining SSH Access**: The attacker has already gained SSH access to the target system.
2. **Using wget to Fetch Malware Samples**: The attacker has used `wget` to download malware samples to the system.
3. **Dropping the Turbo Linux Kernel Module**: The question asks if it is likely that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module will be dropped to disk.
4. **Loading into the Kernel**: After dropping, the module will be loaded into the kernel.
5. **Deleting to Avoid Detection**: Finally, the module will be deleted to avoid detection.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module is likely to be dropped, loaded, and deleted by the Derusbi malware.
  - Derusbi is known for using kernel-level persistence mechanisms, which often involve dropping and loading kernel modules to maintain long-term access.
  - The deletion step is also a common practice to avoid detection by system administrators or security tools.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module is unlikely to be dropped, loaded, and deleted by the Derusbi malware.
  - This would imply that Derusbi does not use kernel-level persistence or does not employ such tactics to avoid detection, which is not consistent with known TTPs of the Derusbi malware.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Derusbi Malware Characteristics**: Derusbi is known to use kernel-level persistence to maintain long-term access to the target system. This often involves dropping and loading kernel modules.
2. **Kernel Module Usage**: Dropping a kernel module to the disk and loading it into the kernel is a common method for maintaining persistence and evading detection.
3. **Deletion for Evasion**: Deleting the module after it has been loaded is a standard practice to avoid leaving traces on the system, which helps in evading detection.

### Conclusion:
Given the known TTPs of the Derusbi malware, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
