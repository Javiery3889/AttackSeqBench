To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the options.

1. **Gathering System and Network Information**: The question mentions that the Aria-body backdoor is used for gathering detailed system and network information during the Discovery tactic. This is a common initial step in many APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) campaigns.

2. **Command and Control (C2) Stage**: The question then asks about the C2 stage, where the APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands.

3. **Naikon APT Group**: The Naikon APT group is known for using various methods to establish and maintain C2 communications. HTTP and TCP are common protocols used in C2 communications due to their widespread use and ease of integration with web-based infrastructure.

4. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the typical behavior of APT groups like Naikon, which often use standard protocols like HTTP and TCP for C2 communications. These protocols are easily accessible and can blend in with normal network traffic, making them less likely to be detected.
   - **B: No**: This choice would imply that the Naikon APT group does not use HTTP and TCP for C2 communications, which contradicts the known tactics and techniques of this group.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Naikon APT group would indeed use HTTP and TCP for C2 communications.

Final Answer: A
