Step 1: Analyze the Question
- SparrowDoor is a TTP used for Discovery, collecting system information.
- FamousSparrow is another TTP, and we need to determine if it involves reading file contents as part of Collection.
- The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents after Discovery.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- SparrowDoor is a TTP in the Discovery phase, which focuses on gathering information about the target environment.
- FamousSparrow is a TTP in the Collection phase, which involves gathering and storing data from the target.
- Reading file contents is a common tactic in the Collection phase as it allows the attacker to gather sensitive information.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- SparrowDoor's purpose is to gather system information, which is a precursor to understanding the environment.
- FamousSparrow, being in the Collection phase, would logically follow up by reading file contents to gather more detailed and sensitive information.
- The sequence of TTPs (Discovery -> Collection) is a common and logical progression in cyber attacks, where attackers first gather information and then use that information to collect more sensitive data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
