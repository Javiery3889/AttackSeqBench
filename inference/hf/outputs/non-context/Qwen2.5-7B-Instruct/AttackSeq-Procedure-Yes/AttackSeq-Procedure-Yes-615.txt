Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     - **Obfuscation:** The VBS script is obfuscated.
     - **Defense Evasion:** The script is designed to evade detection.
     - **Self-Deletion:** The script is configured to delete itself after execution.
     - **C&C Communication:** The script is likely to communicate with a C&C server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the VBS script will indeed communicate with the specified C&C server.
     - Given the context of the TTPs mentioned, it is plausible that the script would include a communication step to a C&C server as part of its operation, especially if it is designed to evade detection and perform further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the VBS script will not communicate with the specified C&C server.
     - This would imply that the script is designed to perform its actions without any external communication, which contradicts the typical behavior of malware that uses C&C servers for further instructions or data exfiltration.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The TTPs described (obfuscation, defense evasion, and self-deletion) are common in malware that communicates with a C&C server. The communication with a C&C server is a standard method for malware to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that the VBS script would include a step to communicate with a C&C server as part of its operation.

**Final Answer: A**
