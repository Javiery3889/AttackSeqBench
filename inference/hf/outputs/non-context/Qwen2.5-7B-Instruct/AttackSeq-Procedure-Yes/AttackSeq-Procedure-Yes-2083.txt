Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The Carbanak group is known for conducting extensive reconnaissance to gather information about their targets, including banking applications and internal procedures. This is a common initial step to avoid detection and tailor their attack.

2. **Spear-Phishing Emails**: The Carbanak group is also known for using sophisticated spear-phishing attacks. These emails are highly targeted and often designed to look legitimate, increasing the likelihood of the recipient opening them.

3. **Malicious URLs and Documents**: Spear-phishing emails often contain malicious links or attachments designed to deliver malware. The Carbanak group has used such tactics to deploy various types of malware, including Cobalt Strike, which is a powerful post-exploitation framework.

4. **Cobalt Strike Beacon Component**: Cobalt Strike is a well-known tool used by the Carbanak group for post-exploitation activities. It allows attackers to maintain persistence, gather information, and execute arbitrary commands.

5. **Gain Initial Access**: After delivering the Cobalt Strike beacon, the group would use it to gain initial access to the target network.

6. **Executing Arbitrary Payloads, Running Shell Commands, and Deleting Files**: These are common post-exploitation activities that the Carbanak group has been known to perform. They use these actions to maintain control, gather data, and cover their tracks.

Given the above points, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the known tactics and techniques of the Carbanak group.

**Final Answer: A**
