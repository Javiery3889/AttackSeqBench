Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with a malicious XLS attachment that uses a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - An MSI package can indeed be configured to install files that achieve persistence. One common method is to create a shortcut (LNK file) that points to the malicious executable and place it in the Startup folder or in the Startup registry key. This ensures that the malicious executable runs every time the user logs into Windows.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the MSI package cannot achieve persistence through the method described. However, given the flexibility of MSI packages and the common practice of using LNK files for autorun, this seems less likely.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence involves a malicious XLS attachment that uses a VB macro to download an MSI package. This suggests a sophisticated attack that can execute arbitrary code.
   - MSI packages are highly customizable and can include installation scripts that can perform various actions, including creating LNK files for autorun.
   - LNK files are a common method for achieving persistence in Windows environments, as they can be placed in the Startup folder or registry keys to ensure the malicious executable runs at startup.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the MSI package can indeed achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

Final Answer: A
