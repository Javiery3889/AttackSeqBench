Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Data Collection:** The malicious app (XAgent) collects data such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location information from iOS devices.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** The collected data is exfiltrated via HTTP requests.
   - **C&C Communication:** The app communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) server.
   - **Token Usage:** A Base64 encoded token is used for identification during communication with the C&C server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
     - Data collection from iOS devices is a common tactic used by malicious apps.
     - Exfiltrating data via HTTP requests is also a common method, as it is simple and can be easily implemented.
     - Using a Base64 encoded token for identification is a plausible method to avoid detection, as it obfuscates the communication.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.
     - However, the described sequence of TTPs is a common and plausible method for a malicious app to operate.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the described sequence of TTPs is a plausible method for a malicious app to operate, as it aligns with common tactics used in mobile malware.

Final Answer: A
