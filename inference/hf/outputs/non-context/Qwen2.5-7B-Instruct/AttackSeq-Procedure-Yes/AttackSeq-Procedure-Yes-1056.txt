Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The question mentions that the Darkhotel APT has performed reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans. This is a common initial step in many APT operations.

2. **Compromise Trusted Commercial Network Resources**: The next step in the sequence is to compromise trusted commercial network resources. This is a strategic move to establish a foothold and maintain persistence within the target network. Darkhotel APT is known for its sophisticated methods, including the use of trusted commercial network resources to support their operations.

3. **Initial Access**: The final step in the sequence is delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates. This is a common technique used by APTs to bypass security measures and gain initial access to a network. Darkhotel APT has been known to use such tactics to deliver malware to their targets.

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with the known tactics of the Darkhotel APT.

**Final Answer: A**
