To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that Blind Eagle initially gains access using a JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord CDN. This is a common method for initial access, as Discord CDN is a legitimate service that can be used to host malicious content.

2. **Execution of Malware**: After gaining initial access, the next step is to execute malware. The question suggests that the group might use PowerShell to load DLLs and perform AMSI bypass. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for its flexibility and ability to execute code in memory, which can help in evading detection. AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) bypass is a technique used to evade antivirus software that uses AMSI to scan PowerShell scripts.

3. **Persistence**: The final step mentioned is achieving persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup. This is a common persistence mechanism where a script or executable is placed in the Startup folder, ensuring that the malware runs every time the system starts.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It is plausible that after gaining initial access, the attackers would use PowerShell for execution and AMSI bypass, and then achieve persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder.
- **B: No** - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. It would imply that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible, which contradicts the logical steps outlined.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed the one that includes the use of PowerShell for execution and AMSI bypass, followed by achieving persistence through a VBScript in the Startup folder.

Final Answer: A
