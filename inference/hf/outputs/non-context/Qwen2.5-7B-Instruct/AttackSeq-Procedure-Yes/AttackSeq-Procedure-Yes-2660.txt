To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves Mustang Panda's Korplug variant.
   - The variant performs data discovery, collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.
   - The question asks if it is likely to use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that the Korplug variant is likely to use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, involving compressed and encrypted messages.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that the Korplug variant is unlikely to use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, involving compressed and encrypted messages.

3. **Evaluating the Plausibility:**
   - **Mustang Panda (also known as APT32)** is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, often involving custom tools and techniques to evade detection.
   - The use of a custom protocol for data exfiltration is a common tactic used by APTs to avoid detection by standard network monitoring tools. This is because custom protocols are not typically monitored or logged by standard security systems.
   - Compressing and encrypting messages can further obfuscate the data being exfiltrated, making it harder for defenders to detect and analyze the traffic.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework includes techniques such as "Custom Protocol" (T1071) and "Data Encrypted Channel" (T1040) which align with the described TTPs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sophistication of Mustang Panda and the common tactics used by APTs, it is highly plausible that the Korplug variant would use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, involving compressed and encrypted messages.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
