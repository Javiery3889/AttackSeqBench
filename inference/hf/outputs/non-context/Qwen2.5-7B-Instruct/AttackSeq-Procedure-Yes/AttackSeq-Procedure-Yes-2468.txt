Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence described involves:
     - Sending a PDF attachment.
     - The attachment passing through security filters and appearing benign.
     - Evading detection by using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the described attack sequence. It is plausible that an attacker could send a PDF attachment that passes through security filters and appears benign. Additionally, attackers often use legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection, as these are less likely to trigger alerts or be flagged by security systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the described attack sequence. If the attack sequence is as described, it would be unlikely to say "No" to the likelihood of such an attack occurring.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attack sequence described is a common tactic used by sophisticated attackers. They often use social engineering to get users to open a malicious PDF attachment, which is designed to pass through security filters and appear benign. Once opened, the PDF can execute malicious code or download additional malware. The use of legitimate tools and scripts for operations is a common evasion technique to avoid detection by security systems.
   - Given the plausibility of the described attack sequence, the correct answer is affirmative.

**Final Answer: A**
