Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with the WastedLocker ransomware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Deployment using PsExec
     - Stopping services
     - Disabling Windows Defender
   - These actions are part of the Defense Evasion phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom in the Impact phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - WastedLocker is known for its ransomware capabilities, which include encrypting files and demanding ransoms.
     - The TTPs described (PsExec, stopping services, and disabling Windows Defender) are common methods used by ransomware to ensure a successful infection and to evade detection.
     - These actions are consistent with the ransomware's objectives in the Impact phase, which include causing significant disruption and demanding a ransom.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the known behavior of WastedLocker and other ransomware.
     - It would be unusual for a ransomware to not encrypt files and demand a ransom after deploying and evading security measures.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The TTPs described (PsExec, stopping services, and disabling Windows Defender) are typical for ransomware deployment and evasion.
   - These actions are designed to ensure the ransomware can operate undetected and cause maximum disruption.
   - WastedLocker is a ransomware that is known to encrypt files and demand ransoms, making it highly likely that it would follow through with these actions after deploying and evading security measures.

**Final Answer: A**
