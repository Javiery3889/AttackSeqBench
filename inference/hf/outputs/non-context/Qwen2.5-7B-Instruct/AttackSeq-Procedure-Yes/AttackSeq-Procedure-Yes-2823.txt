To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **BlackSoul** is the actor or malware in question.
   - **RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding** are used for communication with the C2 server.
   - The communication is part of the Command and Control (C2) process.
   - The question asks if it is likely that BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that BlackSoul will indeed exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration.
     - Given that BlackSoul is already communicating with the C2 server using a specific protocol and encoding, it is reasonable to assume that the same channel could be used for data exfiltration. Automated exfiltration is a common tactic used by malware to send stolen data back to the attacker.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that BlackSoul will not exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration.
     - While it is possible that the C2 channel is only used for command and control and not for data exfiltration, this is less likely given the context. Typically, the same channel used for C2 communication is also used for data exfiltration to maintain stealth and efficiency.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlackSoul is already using a specific protocol and encoding for C2 communication.
   - It is a common practice for malware to use the same channel for both C2 communication and data exfiltration to avoid detection and to streamline the process.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that BlackSoul would use the C2 channel for automated exfiltration of data.

**Final Answer: A**
