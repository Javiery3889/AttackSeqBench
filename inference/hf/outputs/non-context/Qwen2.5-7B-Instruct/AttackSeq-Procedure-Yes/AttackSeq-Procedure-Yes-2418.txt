Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the attackers gained initial access through phishing emails that utilized social engineering to establish backdoors. This is a common method for initial access in many cyber attacks.

2. **Lateral Movement**: The attackers then leveraged control weaknesses in the Windows network to move laterally. This is a plausible step as once initial access is gained, attackers often seek to move within the network to find more valuable targets.

3. **Compromise of Enterprise Admin Account**: The attackers compromised the Enterprise Admin account. This is a significant step as the Enterprise Admin account typically has the highest level of privileges and can be used to gain full control over the infrastructure.

4. **Escalation of Privileges**: The ultimate goal is to obtain 'Keys to the Kingdom' and full access to the infrastructure. Compromising the Enterprise Admin account would indeed provide the attackers with full access to the infrastructure, effectively giving them 'Keys to the Kingdom'.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the answer is highly plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
