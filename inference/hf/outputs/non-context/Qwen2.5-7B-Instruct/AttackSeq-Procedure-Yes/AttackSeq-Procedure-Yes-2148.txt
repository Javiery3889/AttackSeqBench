To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Execution Tactic**: The question mentions that the FlowCloud macro renames files and executes 'gup.exe' using a version of `certutil.exe` (renamed as `Temptcm.tmp`).

2. **Next Step**: The question then asks if it is likely that 'Gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. If 'Gup.exe' is executed, it is reasonable to assume that it could perform additional actions such as executing 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to install payload components for persistence.

**B: No**
- This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible. If 'Gup.exe' is executed, it would be unusual for it to then execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' for persistence, as this would imply a more complex and less common sequence of actions.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Execution of 'gup.exe'**: The execution of 'gup.exe' using `certutil.exe` (renamed as `Temptcm.tmp`) is a common technique used by malware to evade detection by security software that may flag or block `certutil.exe`.

2. **Execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe'**: If 'Gup.exe' is designed to perform actions for persistence, it is plausible that it would execute another component like 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to further install and maintain the payload.

3. **Persistence**: The execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' for persistence is a common tactic in malware to ensure that the payload remains active even after the initial infection vector is removed.

### Conclusion:

Given the typical behavior of malware and the described sequence of actions, it is plausible that 'Gup.exe' would execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to install payload components for persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
