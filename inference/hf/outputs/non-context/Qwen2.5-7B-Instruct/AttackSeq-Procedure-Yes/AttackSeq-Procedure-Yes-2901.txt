To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials. This is a common TTP for gaining initial access to a network.
2. **Credential Theft**: APT15 stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely. This is another common TTP to maintain persistence and access the network.
3. **Persistence**: Deploying backdoors is a method to maintain long-term access to the network. BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS are known backdoors.
4. **Execution**: RoyalCLI is used to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution, which is a method to ensure the backdoor is executed without detection.

Given this sequence, the attack likely follows a logical progression from gaining access, maintaining that access, and then ensuring the backdoors are executed.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the attack sequence described. After obtaining credentials and a certificate, deploying backdoors and using RoyalCLI to bypass execution policies is a plausible and common sequence of TTPs.
- **B: No** - This choice does not align with the attack sequence described. It would imply that APT15 did not deploy backdoors or use RoyalCLI for execution, which contradicts the typical methods used by APTs like APT15.

Final Answer: Yes
