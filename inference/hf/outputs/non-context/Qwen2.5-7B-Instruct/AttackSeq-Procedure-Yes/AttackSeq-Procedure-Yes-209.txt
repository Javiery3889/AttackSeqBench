Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **SparrowDoor:** A tool or method used for communication with the C&C server.
   - **HTTPS Protocol:** Used for encrypted communications.
   - **Multi-byte XOR Keys:** Employed for additional encryption.
   - **Command and Control (C&C):** The process of controlling a compromised system.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after establishing the secure communication channel using SparrowDoor and HTTPS with multi-byte XOR keys, the malware (FamousSparrow) is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that despite the secure communication channel, the malware is unlikely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of SparrowDoor and HTTPS with multi-byte XOR keys indicates a sophisticated and secure method of communication between the malware and the C&C server. This setup is typically used to ensure that the communication is not easily intercepted or detected by security systems.
   - The primary function of a C&C channel is to facilitate the exfiltration of data, issue commands, and receive updates from the malware. Given that the communication is secure and established, it is highly plausible that the malware would use this channel to exfiltrate data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the described TTPs and the typical behavior of malware, the most plausible sequence of events is that the malware would indeed use the established secure channel to exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
