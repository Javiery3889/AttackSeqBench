Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Lazarus group is known for using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to establish command and control (C&C) communication.
   - The group then polls these C&C servers for tasks and executes commands.
   - The question asks if it is likely that they deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leave ransom notes in encrypted directories.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lazarus Group's TTPs:**
     - The Lazarus group is known for using sophisticated malware for cyber espionage and targeted attacks.
     - They have been associated with various types of malware, including backdoors and ransomware.
     - However, the specific use of Hermes ransomware is not a well-documented TTP for the Lazarus group. The Lazarus group is more commonly associated with other types of malware and ransomware, such as Wannacry and other variants.
   - **Hermes Ransomware:**
     - Hermes ransomware is known for its use of a 2048-bit RSA algorithm for encryption and the practice of leaving ransom notes in encrypted directories.
     - This type of ransomware is more commonly associated with other groups, such as the Maze ransomware group, rather than the Lazarus group.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Lazarus group's known TTPs include the use of backdoors for C&C communication and the execution of commands.
   - While the Lazarus group has been known to deploy ransomware, the specific use of Hermes ransomware is not a documented TTP for this group.
   - The characteristics of Hermes ransomware (2048-bit RSA encryption and ransom notes in encrypted directories) are more aligned with other ransomware groups.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the analysis, it is less likely that the Lazarus group would deploy Hermes ransomware as described.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely.

Final Answer: B: No
