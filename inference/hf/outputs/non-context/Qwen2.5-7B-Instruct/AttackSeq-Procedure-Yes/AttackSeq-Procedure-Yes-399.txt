Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware (Gholee) is executed through a concatenated PE file (NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll) using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.
   - The malware is likely to employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection.
   - The malware will then establish a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Gholee malware, like many other sophisticated malware, often employs obfuscation techniques to evade detection by security software, including sandboxes. This is a common tactic to avoid analysis and detection.
     - Establishing a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate is a plausible method to avoid detection by security systems that may flag new or self-signed certificates. Expired certificates are less likely to trigger alerts.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Gholee malware would not use obfuscation or expired certificates, which is less likely given the nature of sophisticated malware.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Gholee malware, as a sophisticated piece of malware, is likely to use obfuscation techniques to evade detection by security software, including sandboxes.
   - Establishing a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate is a common tactic to avoid detection by security systems.
   - Both of these actions are consistent with the behavior of sophisticated malware like Gholee.

**Final Answer: Yes**
