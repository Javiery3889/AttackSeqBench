Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials.
   - It pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
   - It collects and uploads targeted file types (doc, docx, and pdf) to the same server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after stealing credentials, the backdoor will indeed ping the C2 server at regular intervals and then collect and upload specific file types.
     - This sequence of actions is plausible in a typical cyber attack scenario. Stealing credentials is often the first step to gain access to sensitive information. Pinging the C2 server at regular intervals helps maintain a connection and ensures the C2 server is aware of the compromised system. Collecting and uploading specific file types (like documents) is a common tactic to exfiltrate data that might be valuable to the attacker.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not perform the actions described in the question.
     - This is less plausible because it would mean the backdoor is not maintaining a connection with the C2 server and is not collecting specific file types, which are common behaviors in many cyber attacks.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials, which is a common method to gain access to user accounts.
   - Pinging the C2 server at regular intervals is a standard method to maintain a connection and ensure the C2 server is aware of the compromised system.
   - Collecting and uploading targeted file types (doc, docx, and pdf) is a common tactic to exfiltrate valuable data from the compromised system.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: A
