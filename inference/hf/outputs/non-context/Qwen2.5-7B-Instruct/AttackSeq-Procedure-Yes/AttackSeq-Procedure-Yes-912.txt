Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The FAKEM RAT is performing two main actions:
     - Disguising its network traffic to look like standard protocol traffic using encryption.
     - Taking snapshots of the desktop as part of its collection activities.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the FAKEM RAT will perform these actions in the described sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the FAKEM RAT will first disguise its network traffic and then take desktop snapshots.
     - This sequence makes sense because disguising network traffic is a common technique to evade detection by network security systems. Once the RAT has established a covert channel, it can then proceed to perform other malicious activities, such as taking desktop snapshots.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the FAKEM RAT will not follow the described sequence.
     - This is less likely because it would mean the RAT is not using standard evasion techniques, which is a common practice in malware operations.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The FAKEM RAT is likely to use network traffic disguise to evade detection, which is a common and effective technique.
   - After establishing a covert channel, the RAT can then proceed to take desktop snapshots, which is a typical data exfiltration technique.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common malware behavior.

**Final Answer: A**
