Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection Phase:** Data exfiltration using the SmartFTP Client.
   - **Impact Phase:** Deployment of RYUK ransomware using both manual and scripted methods, which included:
     - Remote code execution through WMI command execution.
     - PsExec for execution.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is plausible.
     - **Collection Phase:** The use of SmartFTP Client for data exfiltration is a common method used by adversaries to gather and transfer sensitive data from a compromised network.
     - **Impact Phase:** RYUK ransomware is known to be deployed in a manner that maximizes its destructive capabilities. The use of both manual and scripted methods, including WMI command execution and PsExec, are consistent with the TTPs of RYUK. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is often used for remote code execution and can be used to spread the ransomware across the network. PsExec, a tool by Microsoft, is frequently used to execute processes on remote systems, which is a common method for ransomware deployment.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not plausible.
     - Given the common methods and techniques used by RYUK ransomware, this choice does not align with the typical behavior of the ransomware.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with the known behavior of RYUK ransomware. The use of SmartFTP for data exfiltration and the subsequent deployment of RYUK using WMI and PsExec are consistent with the ransomware's attack pattern.

**Final Answer: Yes**
