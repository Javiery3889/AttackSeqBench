Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Context:** The question refers to Hidden Cobra, a known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group, and their use of the Bankshot malware implant.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - **Reconnaissance Phase:** Hidden Cobra used Bankshot malware to collect information on victim organizations.
     - **Resource Development Phase:** The question asks if it is likely that the group would proceed to distribute Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - **Reasoning:** Hidden Cobra is known for its sophisticated and targeted approach. Using a domain that resembles a cryptocurrency-lending platform would be a plausible method to trick victims into visiting the site and downloading the Bankshot malware. This tactic aligns with the group's known behavior of using convincing and legitimate-looking websites to distribute malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - **Reasoning:** This would imply that Hidden Cobra would not use such a deceptive method, which contradicts their known tactics. It is less likely that they would avoid such a convincing and effective method of distribution.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Hidden Cobra is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, often using convincing and legitimate-looking websites to distribute malware.
   - A domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform would be a plausible and effective method for distributing the Bankshot malware.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that Hidden Cobra would use such a tactic during the resource development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
