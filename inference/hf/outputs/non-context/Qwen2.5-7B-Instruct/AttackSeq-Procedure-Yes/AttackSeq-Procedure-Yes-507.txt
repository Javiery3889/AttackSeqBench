Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The SombRAT backdoor is performing process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will communicate with C2 servers using proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY to implement protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - SombRAT is known for its ability to use various proxy tools and tunneling techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
     - The use of pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY for protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a plausible method for SombRAT to communicate with its C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that SombRAT does not use such proxy tools and tunneling techniques, which is less likely given its known capabilities and the need to evade detection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - SombRAT is a sophisticated backdoor known for its ability to use various evasion techniques, including the use of proxy tools and tunneling.
   - The question specifically mentions the use of pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY, which are known to be used by SombRAT for communication with C2 servers.
   - The implementation of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a common method to bypass network security measures and maintain stealth.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that SombRAT would indeed use these proxy tools and tunneling techniques.

**Final Answer: A**
