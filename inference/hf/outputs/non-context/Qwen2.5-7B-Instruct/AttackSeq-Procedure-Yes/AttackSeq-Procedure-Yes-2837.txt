Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a malware that has already performed reconnaissance by executing the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command. This TTP is used to gather system and process information. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication for its command and control (C2) operations.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
- Answer Choice B: No

To determine the likelihood of the malware using HTTPS for C2 operations, we need to consider the following:
- HTTPS is a secure protocol that encrypts data transmitted between the client and server, making it difficult for network monitoring tools to intercept and analyze the traffic.
- Malware often uses HTTPS to avoid detection by security systems that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
- The reconnaissance phase (gathering system and process information) is typically followed by the C2 phase, where the malware establishes a connection with its command and control server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

Given these points, it is highly plausible that the malware would use HTTPS for its C2 operations to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already performed reconnaissance using 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.
- HTTPS is a common method used by malware for C2 communications to avoid detection.
- The use of HTTPS aligns with typical malware behavior to ensure secure and undetected communication with its C2 server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
