Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a evades detection by modifying the firmware update process.
     - Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a prevents event logging of its operations.
   - The question asks if it is likely capable of wiping server disks as part of hiding tracks and potentially disrupting operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a** is a specific malware that is known for its ability to modify firmware and evade detection. This suggests a high level of sophistication and persistence.
   - The capability to modify firmware and prevent event logging indicates that the malware is designed to be stealthy and persistent.
   - Wiping server disks is a common tactic used by malware to cover its tracks and disrupt operations. This action would be consistent with the malware's known capabilities and objectives.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a modifies the firmware update process, which is a sophisticated method to ensure persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Step 2:** It also prevents event logging, which is another method to avoid detection and maintain stealth.
   - **Step 3:** Given the malware's known capabilities and objectives, wiping server disks is a logical next step to further cover tracks and disrupt operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a is indeed capable of wiping server disks as part of its operations.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: A"
