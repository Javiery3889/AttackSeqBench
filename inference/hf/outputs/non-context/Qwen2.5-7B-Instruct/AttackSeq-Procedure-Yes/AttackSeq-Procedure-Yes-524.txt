Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - XOR obfuscation
   - Sandbox detection
   - String stacking obfuscation
   - Use of encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections
   - Use of Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - XOR obfuscation and string stacking obfuscation are techniques used to evade detection by making the malware's code harder to analyze.
     - Sandbox detection evasion is a common technique to avoid detection by security tools.
     - Using encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications is a plausible method for malware to avoid detection and ensure secure and stealthy communication with its command and control (C2) server.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that INOCNATION malware does not use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications, which contradicts the common practices of modern malware to avoid detection and ensure secure communication.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of encryption (HTTPS) and standard libraries (Windows' SSL/TLS) is a common practice in malware to avoid detection by security tools and to ensure secure communication with the C2 server.
   - The other TTPs (XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking) are also common techniques used by malware to evade detection and analysis.

Given the common practices of malware and the techniques mentioned, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes the use of encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A**
