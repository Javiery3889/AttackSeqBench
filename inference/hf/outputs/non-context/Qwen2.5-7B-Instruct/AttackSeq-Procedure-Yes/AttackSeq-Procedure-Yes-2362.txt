Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The FHAPPI campaign delivered an APT phishing email.
   - The email contained a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - A VBScript was downloaded and opened a .doc file, leading to its execution.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The FHAPPI campaign is known for using sophisticated techniques, including the use of base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious code and the use of PowerShell for execution.
     - Base64 encoding is a common technique used to obfuscate code and evade detection by security tools.
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often used by APTs for its flexibility and ability to perform a wide range of tasks, including persistence, data exfiltration, and lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the FHAPPI campaign does not use base64 encoding or PowerShell, which contradicts the known tactics of this campaign.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The FHAPPI campaign is known for using sophisticated techniques, including base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious code.
   - PowerShell is a common tool used by APTs for executing malicious activities due to its flexibility and powerful capabilities.
   - Given the known tactics of the FHAPPI campaign, it is highly likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

**Final Answer: A**
