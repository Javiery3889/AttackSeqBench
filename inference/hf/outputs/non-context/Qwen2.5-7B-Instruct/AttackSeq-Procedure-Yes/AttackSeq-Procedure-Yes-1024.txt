Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malicious macros are injected into Word and Excel documents for lateral movement. The next step in the attack sequence is to determine if Gamaredon’s malware is likely to search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Gamaredon is known for its targeted attacks, often focusing on collecting sensitive information. The use of macros for lateral movement suggests an attempt to maintain persistence and access to the network. It is plausible that once the malware has gained a foothold, it would search for sensitive documents to exfiltrate them.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware would not search for sensitive documents. However, given Gamaredon’s history of targeting sensitive information, this seems less likely.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the malware is already in the process of lateral movement, which is a common phase in targeted attacks.
- Gamaredon’s known tactics include the collection of sensitive information, which would be a logical next step after gaining access to multiple systems.
- The use of macros for lateral movement indicates an attempt to maintain persistence and access, which aligns with the goal of collecting sensitive data.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that the malware would search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.

Final Answer: A
