To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP: Creation of a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter**
   - This TTP is described in the question, indicating that the attackers used a custom plugin to collect emails from the victim's Roundcube email client.

2. **Exfiltration of Data**
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the BlueDelta campaign exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie, address book, and database information.
   - Exfiltration of session cookies and address book data is a common tactic in cyber attacks, as it can provide the attackers with access to the victim's email account and potentially other services linked to the email account.
   - Exfiltration of database information is also plausible, as it could provide the attackers with a comprehensive view of the victim's email interactions and potentially other sensitive data stored in the database.

3. **Command and Control (C2) Activities**
   - The question also mentions the use of web protocols for C2 activities.
   - After exfiltrating the necessary data, the attackers would likely use web protocols to establish a C2 channel to control the compromised system or to exfiltrate additional data.

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with typical cyber attack methodologies.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs, as it includes the exfiltration of session cookies, address book, and database information, followed by C2 activities.
- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs, as it does not include the exfiltration of the necessary data and C2 activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
