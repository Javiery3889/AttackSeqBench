Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question is asking about the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Black Energy 2 malware. Specifically, it inquires about the sequence of actions: DLL injection into svchost.exe, maintaining persistence, and then communication with the C2 server through HTTP requests.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - DLL injection into svchost.exe is a known technique used by Black Energy 2 to maintain persistence. This is because svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that can host multiple services, making it a good candidate for hiding malicious code.
  - Maintaining persistence is a common goal for malware, and DLL injection is a reliable method to achieve this.
  - After establishing persistence, the malware would likely communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. HTTP requests are a common method for this communication as they are widely supported and can be easily encrypted.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the known TTPs of Black Energy 2. There is no evidence to suggest that Black Energy 2 does not use DLL injection into svchost.exe for persistence or that it does not communicate with its C2 server via HTTP requests.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Black Energy 2 is known to use DLL injection into svchost.exe to maintain persistence. This technique is well-documented in various CTI reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- The malware then communicates with its C2 server, which is typically done through HTTP requests to avoid detection by network security measures.
- Both of these actions are consistent with the TTPs of Black Energy 2.

Final Answer: A
