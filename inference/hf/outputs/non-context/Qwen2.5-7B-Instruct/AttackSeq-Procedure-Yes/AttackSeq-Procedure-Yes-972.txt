Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural) used by the Aria-body backdoor.
- The backdoor first gathers system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase.
- The question then asks if it is likely to proceed to creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities during the Collection phase.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The Aria-body backdoor is known for its capabilities in gathering system information and performing various data collection activities.
- The Discovery phase typically involves gathering information about the target environment to understand its configuration and vulnerabilities.
- The Collection phase involves the actual exfiltration of data, which can include creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Aria-body backdoor is designed to gather detailed information about the target system, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
- After gathering this information, the next logical step is to collect more specific data, which can include creating/deleting files and taking screenshots, as these actions are part of the Collection phase.
- The Aria-body backdoor is known to perform these actions to gather more detailed data from the compromised system.

Final Answer: A: Yes
