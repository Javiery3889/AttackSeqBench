To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **API Hooking**: The question mentions that the backdoor uses API hooking techniques to modify functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection by system-level monitoring tools. It allows the malware to intercept and modify system calls, making it harder for security software to detect its presence.

2. **Encryption/Decryption Key and XOR-Encrypted C&C Server Address**: The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor configuration will include an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address for its communication with external entities. This is a plausible TTP for a backdoor, as it helps to obfuscate the communication and make it more difficult for defenders to intercept and understand the data being transmitted.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the backdoor configuration is likely to include an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address. This aligns with common practices in malware development to ensure secure and stealthy communication.
- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the backdoor configuration is unlikely to include such features. However, given the nature of sophisticated malware like Waterbear, which is known for its stealth and persistence, it is reasonable to assume that it would employ such techniques to secure its communications.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **API Hooking**: This is a common and effective technique for evading detection.
2. **Encryption/Decryption Key and XOR-Encryption**: These are standard practices for securing communications and ensuring that the C&C server address is not easily readable or intercepted.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
