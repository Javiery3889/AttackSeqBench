To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices in the context of APT28's known tactics and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Attack Vector**: The question mentions that APT28 uses spear-phishing campaigns to harvest credentials. This aligns with the Credential Access phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically T1110 (Spearphishing Link) and T1190 (Spearphishing Attachment).

2. **Subsequent Actions**: The question then asks if APT28 is likely to use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers during the Lateral Movement phase. This phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework includes T1021 (Exploitation for Lateral Movement) and T1098 (Exploitation of Remote Services).

3. **APT28's Known TTPs**: APT28, also known as Sofacy or Sednit, is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks. They often use a combination of social engineering (like spear-phishing) and technical exploits to gain initial access and then move laterally within a network. Given their history, it is highly plausible that they would leverage known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers as part of their attack strategy.

4. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with APT28's known tactics. They are known to use a combination of social engineering and technical exploits to move laterally within networks.
   - **B: No**: This choice does not align with APT28's known tactics, as they have demonstrated the capability and intent to use both social engineering and technical exploits.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 would indeed use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers after harvesting credentials through spear-phishing.

Final Answer: A
