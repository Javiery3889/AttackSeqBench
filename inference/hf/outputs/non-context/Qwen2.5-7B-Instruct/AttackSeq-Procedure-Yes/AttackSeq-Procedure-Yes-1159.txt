Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural) during an attack lifecycle.
- PROMETHIUM is a malware that searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives.
- These archives are then encoded with an unusual scheme and split into chunks before being exfiltrated to the C2 server.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. Encoding archives with an unusual scheme and splitting them into chunks are common techniques used to evade detection and ensure data integrity during exfiltration.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. If the malware does not encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks, it would be less likely to evade detection and ensure data integrity during exfiltration.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- PROMETHIUM's behavior of compressing Microsoft Office files into archives is a known TTP during the Collection phase.
- The question then asks if the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks during the Exfiltration phase.
- Encoding and splitting files are common techniques used by malware to avoid detection by security systems and to ensure data integrity.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that PROMETHIUM would employ these techniques during the Exfiltration phase.

Final Answer: A
