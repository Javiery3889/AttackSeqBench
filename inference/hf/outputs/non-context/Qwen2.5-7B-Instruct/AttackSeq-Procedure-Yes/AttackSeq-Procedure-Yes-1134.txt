Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The attacker has established persistence using a scheduled task named 'SystemFailureReporter' to execute the SideTwist payload every 5 minutes.
   - **Communication:** The SideTwist backdoor is likely to communicate with the C&C server (sarmsoftware[.]com) using encrypted HTTP channels.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the SideTwist backdoor communicates with the C&C server using encrypted HTTP channels. While HTTP is not typically considered an encrypted protocol (it uses plaintext for data transmission), it is possible for the backdoor to use HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for encrypted communication. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts the data being transmitted.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the SideTwist backdoor does not communicate with the C&C server using encrypted HTTP channels. This would imply that the communication is done in plaintext, which is less secure and more easily detected.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of an encrypted channel (HTTPS) would provide better stealth and security for the attacker, as it would be more difficult to detect and analyze the traffic. However, the question does not provide any specific information that would rule out the use of plain HTTP or HTTPS.
   - Given that the question does not provide any contradictory information and the use of HTTPS is a plausible method for secure communication, the most plausible answer is that the SideTwist backdoor does indeed use encrypted HTTP channels.

**Final Answer: A**
