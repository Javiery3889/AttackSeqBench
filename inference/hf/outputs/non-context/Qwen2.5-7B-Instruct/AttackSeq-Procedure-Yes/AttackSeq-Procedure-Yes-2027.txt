Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions the use of Seaduke for secure communication with the command-and-control (C2) server.
   - It also mentions the use of multiple layers of encryption and encoding for C2.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Duke group will use Seaduke for exfiltrating sensitive data to legitimate cloud services.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Duke group would use Seaduke for exfiltrating data to legitimate cloud services.
     - Given that Seaduke is already being used for secure C2 communication, it is plausible that the same tool or a similar method could be used for data exfiltration, especially if the goal is to maintain stealth and use legitimate services to avoid detection.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Duke group would not use Seaduke for exfiltrating data to legitimate cloud services.
     - While it is possible that they might use a different method for exfiltration, the question does not provide any information that would rule out the use of Seaduke for this purpose. Using the same tool for both C2 and exfiltration could be a strategy to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question does not provide any specific information that would indicate the Duke group would not use Seaduke for exfiltration. In fact, using the same tool for both C2 and exfiltration is a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs) to maintain consistency and reduce the risk of detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Duke group would use Seaduke for exfiltrating sensitive data to legitimate cloud services.

**Final Answer: A**
