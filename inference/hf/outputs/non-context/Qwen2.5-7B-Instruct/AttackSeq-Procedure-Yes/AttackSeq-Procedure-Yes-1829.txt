Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Evasion through overlay screens:** This is a technique to hide the installation of the payload app from the user and security software.
   - **Collection of files and screenshots:** This indicates the app is gathering sensitive information from the compromised device.
   - **Encryption using RSA and AES:** This is a method to secure the data before exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration to the C&C server:** This is the final step where the encrypted data is sent to a command and control server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It logically follows that after evading detection, the app would collect sensitive data (files and screenshots), encrypt it using strong encryption algorithms (RSA and AES), and then exfiltrate it to a C&C server.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. If the app does not collect files and screenshots, or does not encrypt the data, or does not exfiltrate it, then the sequence of TTPs would be incomplete or incorrect.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the provided answer choices, the most plausible sequence is described in Answer A.

Final Answer: Yes
