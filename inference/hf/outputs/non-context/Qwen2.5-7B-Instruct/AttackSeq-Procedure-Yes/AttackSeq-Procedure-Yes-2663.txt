To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Attackers executed 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza'**: This indicates that the attackers have established a backdoor on the infected computers to maintain persistent access.

2. **Installed additional malware to access user databases**: This suggests that the attackers are looking to exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised systems.

3. **Communicated with the command and control (C2) server**: This is a typical TTP where the attackers use a C2 server to control the infected systems and manage the exfiltration of data.

4. **Domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41**: This indicates that the attackers are using a domain that is likely to be trusted or less suspicious, possibly to avoid detection.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the typical behavior of attackers who use trusted domains to communicate with their C2 servers. The use of a South Korean domain and IP address could be an attempt to blend in with legitimate traffic or to avoid detection by security systems that might be more focused on domains from known malicious regions.

- **B: No**: This choice would imply that the attackers did not communicate with the C2 server, which contradicts the typical TTPs of maintaining control over compromised systems and exfiltrating data.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the infected computers did communicate with the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
