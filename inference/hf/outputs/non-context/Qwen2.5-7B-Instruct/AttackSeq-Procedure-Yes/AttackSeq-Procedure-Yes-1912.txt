To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that APT10 sends spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain initial access. This is a common TTP for APT10, as evidenced by their historical tactics.

2. **Internal Reconnaissance**: After gaining initial access, the next step is to conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network. This is a logical and necessary step for APTs to understand the network topology, identify valuable targets, and plan further actions. APT10 is known for their thorough reconnaissance activities to gather information about their targets.

3. **Lateral Movement**: Once the network is mapped, the next step is to move laterally within the network. The question mentions leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure for this purpose. APT10 has been observed using shared infrastructure to move laterally between different organizations, as it provides a convenient and less suspicious method of moving between networks.

4. **Shared MSP Infrastructure**: The use of shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement is a plausible tactic for APT10, as it allows them to exploit the trust relationships between different organizations and move between them without raising immediate suspicion.

Given this analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is a logical and plausible one for APT10's attack methodology.

**Final Answer: A**
