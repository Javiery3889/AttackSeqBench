To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step:

1. **Initial Reconnaissance:**
   - The question mentions discovering information on processes and memory utilization to scan for deleted files and monitor network traffic to Microsoft IIS web servers. This indicates an initial reconnaissance phase where the malware is gathering information about the system and network.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - The next step is to gather computer information for the purpose of collection. This aligns with the typical behavior of malware that aims to gather as much information as possible about the target environment before proceeding with more malicious activities.

3. **Payload Preparation:**
   - The question then mentions encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration. This suggests that the malware is preparing to exfiltrate data, likely after it has been collected and possibly encoded to avoid detection.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - Answer Choice A: "Yes" suggests that the sequence of TTPs (techniques, tactics, and procedures) described in the question is plausible. It follows a logical progression from initial reconnaissance, data collection, to payload preparation and exfiltration.
   - Answer Choice B: "No" would imply that the sequence described is not plausible, which would contradict the typical behavior of sophisticated malware like Regin.

Given the typical behavior of advanced malware such as Regin, which is known for its complex and multi-stage attack lifecycle, the sequence described in the question is indeed plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
