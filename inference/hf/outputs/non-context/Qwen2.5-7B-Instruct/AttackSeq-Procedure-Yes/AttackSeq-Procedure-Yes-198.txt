Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that FamousSparrow exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities to drop and execute SparrowDoor through `cmd.exe`. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.

2. **Persistence**: The question asks about the method used to achieve persistence. The two methods mentioned are:
   - Creating a registry Run key entry.
   - Installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex.

3. **Registry Run Key Entry**: This is a common method for persistence. By adding an entry to the Windows registry under the `Run` key, the malware can ensure that it starts with the system or user session, thus maintaining persistence.

4. **Service Installation**: Installing a service named `WSearchIndex` is also a method to achieve persistence. However, `WSearchIndex` is a common name for a legitimate Windows service (Windows Search Service), and using this name could be suspicious and might not be as stealthy as using a less common name.

5. **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that both methods (registry Run key entry and service installation) are plausible and likely used by FamousSparrow.
   - **B: No**: This choice suggests that neither method is likely used by FamousSparrow.

Given the context and the nature of the attack described, it is plausible that FamousSparrow would use both methods to ensure persistence. However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs after initial access, and both methods are valid and commonly used.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
