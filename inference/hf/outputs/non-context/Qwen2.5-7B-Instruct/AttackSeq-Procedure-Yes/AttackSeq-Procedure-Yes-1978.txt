Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Initial Access Phase:**
   - The question mentions that the adversary sends emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT. This is a common tactic used in spear-phishing attacks to gain initial access to a network.

2. **Resource Development Phase:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s during the Resource Development phase.
   - Compromised webservers are often used to host malicious content, such as delivery scripts, to avoid detection and to facilitate the download of malware.
   - Virtual Private Servers (VPS) are frequently used by adversaries to host Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, as they offer a level of anonymity and can be easily reconfigured or replaced if detected.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the typical behavior of adversaries who use compromised infrastructure to host malicious content and C2 servers.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the adversary would not use compromised webservers and VPSs, which is less likely given the common practices in cyber-attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
