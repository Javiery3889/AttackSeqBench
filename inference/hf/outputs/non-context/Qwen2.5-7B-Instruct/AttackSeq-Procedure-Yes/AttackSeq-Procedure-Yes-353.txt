Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves the threat actors using or manipulating trust controls to evade detection.
   - **T1057 Process Discovery:** This technique involves the threat actors gathering information about the processes running on the target systems to understand the environment.
   - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the threat actors using standard network protocols to establish a command and control channel.

2. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls) → T1057 (Process Discovery) → T1071 (Application Layer Protocol):**
     - After subverting trust controls, the threat actors would likely want to understand the environment they have compromised. This is where **T1057 (Process Discovery)** comes into play. By discovering processes, the threat actors can gather information about the systems and internal networks, which is crucial for planning further actions.
     - Once they have gathered this information, the threat actors would then likely use **T1071 (Application Layer Protocol)** to establish a covert communication channel for command and control. This step is logical as it allows the threat actors to maintain control over the compromised infrastructure without being detected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the logical sequence of TTPs described above.
   - **B: No** - This choice does not align with the logical sequence of TTPs described above.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
