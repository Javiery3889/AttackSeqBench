Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - **Initial TTPs:** The question mentions that APT28 has already discovered the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems with bots that report back to a central server.
   - **Next TTPs:** The question then asks if APT28 is likely to probe potential victims' identity information using geographically distributed scan bots before employing crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails for gaining initial access.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 would indeed probe for identity information using geographically distributed scan bots before moving on to the next steps.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 would not use geographically distributed scan bots to probe for identity information before employing crafted documents in spear phishing emails.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **APT28's Known TTPs:** APT28 is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, often involving the use of social engineering techniques such as spear phishing. They are also known to use reconnaissance to gather detailed information about their targets.
   - **Relevance of Geographically Distributed Scan Bots:** While APT28 is known for its detailed reconnaissance, the use of geographically distributed scan bots to probe for identity information is not a typical TTP for this group. APT28 is more likely to use more targeted and less detectable methods for gathering such information.
   - **Crafted Documents in Spear Phishing:** APT28 is known to use highly targeted spear phishing campaigns with crafted documents to gain initial access. This aligns more closely with their known tactics.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the known tactics of APT28, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve detailed reconnaissance and targeted spear phishing rather than the use of geographically distributed scan bots for probing identity information.

**Final Answer: B**
