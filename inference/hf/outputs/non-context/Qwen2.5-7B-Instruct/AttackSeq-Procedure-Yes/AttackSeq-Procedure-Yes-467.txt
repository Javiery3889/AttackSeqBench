To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each component:

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878. This is a well-documented method used by various threat actors, including APTs like Hidden Cobra.

2. **Resource Development**: The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants. Bankshot is a known implant used by Hidden Cobra, which is a state-sponsored APT associated with the People's Liberation Army of China. The development of such implants is consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Hidden Cobra.

3. **Capabilities**: The Bankshot implants are known to provide attackers with full control over victim systems. This aligns with the described capability of giving attackers full control over the targeted systems.

4. **Wiping Files**: The question also mentions wiping files from the targeted system. While this is a destructive action, it is not a primary TTP of Hidden Cobra. Hidden Cobra is more known for data exfiltration and long-term persistence rather than file wiping.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Initial Access via spear phishing with a malicious document exploiting a known vulnerability.
- Development and use of the Bankshot implants for full control over the victim systems.
- Full control over the systems is consistent with the known TTPs of Hidden Cobra.
- Wiping files is not a primary TTP of Hidden Cobra, but it is not inconsistent with their activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
