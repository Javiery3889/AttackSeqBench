To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Distributing Malicious LNK Files**: The question mentions that the malicious LNK files are disguised as a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results via spear-phishing. This is a common TTP used by APT groups to trick users into executing the malicious payload.

2. **Executing JavaScript File**: After the user opens the LNK file, the question states that a JavaScript file is executed. This is a plausible step as JavaScript can be used to download and execute other payloads, such as the 'd3reEW.exe' file.

3. **Creating and Executing 'd3reEW.exe'**: The question mentions that the JavaScript file creates and executes 'd3reEW.exe'. This is a typical TTP where a payload is dropped and executed to maintain persistence or perform further actions.

4. **Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the Startup Directory**: The question states that 'svchhast.exe' is copied to the startup directory. This is a common persistence mechanism used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts, making it harder to remove.

5. **Sending a POST Request to a Hardcoded URL**: Finally, the question mentions that a POST request is sent to a hardcoded URL. This is a common exfiltration technique used to send data back to the attacker's server.

Given the above sequence of TTPs, it is highly plausible that the Higaisa APT group would follow this attack sequence. The steps align with typical APT behavior and the described TTPs are consistent with known APT tactics.

**Final Answer: A**
