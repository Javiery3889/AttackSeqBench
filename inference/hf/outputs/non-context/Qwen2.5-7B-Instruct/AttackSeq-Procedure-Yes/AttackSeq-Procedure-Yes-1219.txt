To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Accessing the Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller using Mimikatz for Credential Theft:**
   - This is a common TTP used by APT groups to gain initial access and maintain persistence. Mimikatz is known to be used by various APTs for credential dumping.

2. **Compressing Proprietary Data from Visma using WinRAR:**
   - While this is a plausible step, it is not a standard or commonly reported TTP for APT10. APT10 is known for its sophisticated methods, but compressing data using WinRAR is not a typical step in their known TTPs.

3. **Exfiltrating the Data to a Dropbox Account via the cURL for Windows Command-Line Tool:**
   - Exfiltrating data to a Dropbox account is a plausible method, but using cURL for Windows is not a common method for APT10. APT10 is known to use more sophisticated and stealthy methods for data exfiltration.

Given the above analysis, the sequence described in the question does not align well with the known TTPs of APT10. APT10 is more likely to use more advanced and stealthy methods for data compression and exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B**
