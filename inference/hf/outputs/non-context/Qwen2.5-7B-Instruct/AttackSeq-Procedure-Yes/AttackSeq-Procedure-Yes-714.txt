To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the attack begins with the injection of the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word through a malicious macro. This is a common method used by attackers to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Rising Sun Implant**: The question then asks if the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution. The Rising Sun implant is a hypothetical or known malware component that could be used to perform various malicious activities, including downloading additional payloads.

3. **Second-Stage Payload**: The second-stage payload is typically used to download and install more sophisticated malware or to perform specific tasks that the initial payload cannot accomplish. This is a common tactic in multi-stage attacks.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will indeed download a second-stage payload. This is plausible because the Rising Sun implant, as a component of the attack, would likely have the capability to download additional malware to perform more complex tasks.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will not download a second-stage payload. This is less plausible because the Rising Sun implant, as a component of the attack, would typically be designed to enhance the attack by downloading additional malware.

Given the context of the attack sequence and the typical behavior of malware components, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload.

**Final Answer: A**
