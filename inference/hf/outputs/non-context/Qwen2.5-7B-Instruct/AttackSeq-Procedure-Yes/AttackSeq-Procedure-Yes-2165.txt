To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the steps and the provided answer choices.

1. **Persistence**: The malware ensures persistence by registering a DLL as a service and using mutexes to prevent multiple instances. This is a common TTP for malware to ensure it remains active on the system.

2. **Obfuscation**: The malware uses a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration, which includes C&C server information. This is a common tactic to avoid detection and ensure that the configuration remains hidden until needed.

3. **Decryption**: The malware decrypts the obfuscated configuration using a provided algorithm to reveal the C&C servers. This step is necessary to activate the malware's communication with the command and control (C&C) infrastructure.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. The malware first ensures persistence, then obfuscates its configuration, and finally decrypts it to reveal the C&C servers. This is a plausible and common sequence of actions for malware like NetTraveler.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. If the malware does not use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration and decrypt it to reveal C&C servers, it would not follow the described attack sequence.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
