Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack:
1. The use of DDE to invoke PowerShell.
2. Execution of encoded commands via PowerShell.
3. Contacting a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. After invoking PowerShell and executing encoded commands, it is a common practice in multi-stage attacks to contact a control server to distribute the next stage of malware. This allows the attackers to maintain control and update the malware as needed.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. If the attackers have already used DDE and PowerShell to execute encoded commands, it would be unusual and less effective to not follow up with a control server to distribute the next stage of malware.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands is a sophisticated technique to bypass traditional security measures.
- Contacting a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware is a common tactic in multi-stage attacks, allowing the attackers to maintain control and distribute additional malware as needed.
- The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common attack sequence in advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other sophisticated cyber attacks.

Final Answer: A
