To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the scenario and the answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The attack starts with the exploitation of known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
   - The next step involves the use of RIG EK (Exploit Kit) to deliver exploits.
   - The question asks if RIG EK is likely to use malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites before finally redirecting them to its landing page.

2. **Analyzing RIG EK:**
   - RIG EK is a well-known exploit kit that has historically used various methods to deliver its payload, including malvertising.
   - Malvertising involves the use of legitimate-looking advertisements to deliver malicious content. This method is often used to bypass traditional security measures and to infect users without their knowledge.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that RIG EK is likely to use malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites before reaching its landing page. This aligns with the known tactics of RIG EK and other exploit kits.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that RIG EK does not use malvertising in this manner, which contradicts the known behavior of RIG EK and other exploit kits.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the historical behavior of RIG EK and the effectiveness of malvertising in delivering malicious content, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that RIG EK would indeed use malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites before reaching its landing page.

Final Answer: A
