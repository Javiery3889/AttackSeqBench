Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers have gained initial access to the network by scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers.
2. **Pivot to the Entire Network**: The attackers then use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network. This implies that the attackers are likely to use the compromised web servers to move laterally within the network.
3. **Lateral Movement**: The question then asks if the attackers will employ the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after gaining initial access and using the infected servers as a pivot, the attackers will indeed use the Explosive Trojan to spread laterally via USB devices.
  - While it is plausible that attackers might use a variety of methods to spread laterally, the question specifically mentions the use of an Explosive Trojan for this purpose. This is a specific and somewhat unusual method, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility, especially if the attackers are looking for a method that is less likely to be detected.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers will not use the Explosive Trojan to spread laterally via USB devices.
  - This is less likely because the question implies that the Explosive Trojan is a method to achieve lateral movement, and the attackers are already using the infected servers as a pivot. It would be unusual for them to not use a method that is specifically mentioned for achieving their goal.

Given the context and the specific mention of the Explosive Trojan in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to use it for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A**
