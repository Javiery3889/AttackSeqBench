Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package. This is a clear indication of the initial compromise and the method used to gain entry.

2. **Execution of Malicious Documents**: The question then asks if it is likely that malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed. This implies that after the initial compromise, the next step would be to execute a document that contains the actual payload or dropper for the backdoor.

3. **Persistence and Configuration**: The question also mentions that the backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the command-and-control servers via SSL. This indicates that the backdoor needs to be operational and maintain a connection to the C2 server.

4. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - **Answer Choice A (Yes)**: This suggests that after gaining initial access, the next steps would be to execute the malicious documents, establish persistence, and then connect to the C2 server. This sequence aligns with typical malware behavior where the initial payload (dropper) is executed to install the backdoor, which then sets up persistence and communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B (No)**: This would imply that the execution of malicious documents and the establishment of persistence do not occur in the sequence described. However, this does not align with the typical behavior of malware, which usually requires these steps to ensure long-term access and control.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the typical behavior of malware and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malicious documents are executed, followed by the establishment of persistence, and then the connection to the C2 server.

Final Answer: Yes
