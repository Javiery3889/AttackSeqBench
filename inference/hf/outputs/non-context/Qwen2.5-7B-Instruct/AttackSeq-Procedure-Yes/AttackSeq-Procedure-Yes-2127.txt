To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Stopedge.bat Schedules Install.vbs**: This indicates the use of a batch file to schedule a VBScript for persistence. This is a common technique used by APT groups to ensure their malware remains active on the system.

2. **Heavy Obfuscation**: The question suggests that the Konni APT Group might use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, to evade detection. This is a plausible TTP for APT groups, as obfuscation can make the scripts harder to analyze and detect.

3. **XOR Encoding**: XOR encoding is a common method to obfuscate scripts. It changes the script's appearance without altering its functionality, making it difficult for antivirus software and security analysts to understand the script's purpose.

4. **Versioninfo.bat for System Details**: The question mentions that 'versioninfo.bat' is used to discover system details such as directory listings and running processes. This is a standard TTP used by malware to gather information about the infected system.

5. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described in the question is:
   - Stopedge.bat schedules Install.vbs for persistence.
   - Install.vbs is heavily obfuscated, including XOR encoding.
   - Versioninfo.bat is used to gather system details.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It suggests that the Konni APT Group would use heavily obfuscated scripts, including XOR encoding, to evade detection, and would use 'versioninfo.bat' to gather system details. This sequence is consistent with the described attack pattern.

- **B: No**: This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. It would imply that the Konni APT Group does not use heavily obfuscated scripts or gather system details using 'versioninfo.bat', which is inconsistent with the described attack pattern.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
