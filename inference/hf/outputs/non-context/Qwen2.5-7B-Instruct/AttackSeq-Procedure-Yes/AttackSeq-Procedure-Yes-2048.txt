To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Resource Development Phase:**
   - Charming Kitten created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials.
   - This indicates a focus on gathering credentials from users who might visit these fake sites, likely targeting a broad audience.

2. **Reconnaissance Phase:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that they targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists.
   - This suggests a more specific targeting strategy during the Reconnaissance phase, focusing on a particular group (non-Iranian researchers) and using a more sophisticated method (impersonating well-known individuals).

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that after the initial broad attack during the Resource Development phase, Charming Kitten then targeted non-Iranian researchers specifically by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists.
- This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors who often refine their targeting after initial reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

**B: No**
- This choice suggests that the impersonation of well-known researchers or journalists was not a part of their strategy during the Reconnaissance phase.
- This would imply a more generalized approach during the Reconnaissance phase, which does not align as closely with the described TTPs.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Attack (Resource Development Phase):**
   - Broad targeting through fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram.
   - This phase is about gathering as many credentials as possible from a wide audience.

2. **Refined Targeting (Reconnaissance Phase):**
   - After obtaining credentials, the attackers likely conducted further reconnaissance to identify specific targets, such as non-Iranian researchers.
   - Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists is a sophisticated method to gain trust and gather more detailed information about the target.

### Conclusion:

Given the described TTPs, it is more plausible that Charming Kitten would use a more targeted approach during the Reconnaissance phase, which includes impersonating well-known individuals to gather more detailed information about specific targets.

**Final Answer: A**
