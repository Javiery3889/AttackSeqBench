To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step:

1. **Discovery Phase**: The question mentions the use of scanning tools such as HUC Port Banner Scanner and commands like 'hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443'. This indicates that the attackers are scanning a range of IP addresses for open ports, specifically targeting common services like SMB (445), RDP (3389), MS SQL (1433), MySQL (3306), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443).

2. **Exploitation**: After scanning, the attackers are likely to exploit any open services they find. The TTPs mentioned (HUC Port Banner Scanner and 'hbs.exe') are commonly used for port scanning and service enumeration, which are preparatory steps for exploitation.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers. Lateral movement is a common tactic in cyber attacks, where the attacker moves from the initial point of compromise to other parts of the network to gain more access and control.

4. **Earth Lusca**: Earth Lusca is a known malware family associated with the Lazarus group, which is known for its sophisticated attack methods, including the use of remote services for lateral movement and establishing network tunnels.

Given the above analysis, it is highly plausible that after scanning and exploiting remote services, the attackers would engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels. This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like the Lazarus group.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
