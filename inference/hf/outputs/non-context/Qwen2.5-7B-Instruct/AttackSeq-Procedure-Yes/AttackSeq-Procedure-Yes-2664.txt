To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - **TTPs Involved:**
     - **Delivery Method:** Email attachment as part of a phishing campaign.
     - **Payload:** OceanLotus backdoor.
     - **Execution:** Hidden file named `.CFUserEncoding`.
     - **Action:** Display a decoy document.

2. **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor, when delivered via an email attachment, will execute a hidden file named `.CFUserEncoding` and then display a decoy document.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - The `.CFUserEncoding` file name is unusual and could be a method to avoid detection by antivirus software, as it is not a typical file extension.
       - Displaying a decoy document is a common tactic in phishing campaigns to trick the user into believing the document is legitimate, thereby increasing the likelihood of the user executing the payload.
       - The OceanLotus backdoor is known for its sophisticated methods, including the use of hidden files and social engineering techniques like displaying decoy documents.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor, when delivered via an email attachment, will not execute a hidden file named `.CFUserEncoding` and will not display a decoy document.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This contradicts the known tactics of the OceanLotus backdoor and the typical behavior of phishing campaigns.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The OceanLotus backdoor is known for its stealth and social engineering tactics.
   - The use of a hidden file like `.CFUserEncoding` is a plausible method to avoid detection.
   - Displaying a decoy document is a common technique in phishing campaigns to trick users.
   - The combination of these tactics aligns with the known behavior of the OceanLotus backdoor.

**Final Answer: A**
