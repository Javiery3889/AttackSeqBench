Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT28, starting with the use of DDE via PowerShell to execute encoded commands.
- The question then asks if it is likely to observe the document creating a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- APT28 is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence on a victim's system. Persistence is crucial for APTs to ensure they can re-establish access after a system is rebooted or cleaned.
- Creating a batch file and a registry entry are common methods to achieve persistence. Batch files can be scheduled to run at system startup, and registry entries can be used to load malware during system initialization.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- APT28's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often involve multiple layers of persistence to ensure long-term access to a compromised system.
- The use of DDE via PowerShell to execute encoded commands is a method to gain initial access and execute the payload.
- To maintain this access, APT28 is likely to employ additional persistence mechanisms such as creating a batch file and a registry entry. These methods are well-documented in CTI reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework as part of the Persistence technique (T1543).
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that APT28 would use these methods to ensure the malware remains on the victim's system after the initial infection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
