To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Evasion Techniques**: The question mentions that the APT group evades defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows and using fileless loading techniques. This indicates a sophisticated approach to avoid detection.

2. **Backdoor Usage**: The question then asks if the Naikon APT group used the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase. The Aria-body backdoor is known for its ability to gather system information, which aligns with the need to discover active processes.

3. **Communication Protocols**: After gathering information, the APT group is said to use HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server. This is a common method for maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the APT group indeed used the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes, which aligns with the described TTPs. The use of a backdoor to gather system information is a plausible step in the attack sequence, especially given the sophistication implied by the evasion techniques.

- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the APT group did not use the Aria-body backdoor for gathering information about active processes, which contradicts the information provided in the question.

Given the alignment of the Aria-body backdoor's capabilities with the described TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the APT group did use the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes.

**Final Answer: A**
