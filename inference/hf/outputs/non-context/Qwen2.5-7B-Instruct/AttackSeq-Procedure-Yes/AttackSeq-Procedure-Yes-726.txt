Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The Rising Sun implant has already performed initial reconnaissance.
- It communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
- The communication is encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks if the same methods (RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding) are likely to be used for data exfiltration.
- RC4 is a stream cipher that can be used to encrypt data.
- Base64 encoding is often used to encode binary data into a text format, which is useful for exfiltrating data over HTTP or other text-based protocols.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Rising Sun implant uses RC4 for encryption and Base64 for obfuscation during communication with the control server. These methods are chosen to ensure that the data is both encrypted and disguised to avoid detection.
- Data exfiltration would likely follow the same security measures to maintain stealth and confidentiality. Using the same encryption (RC4) and encoding (Base64) methods would ensure consistency and reduce the risk of detection.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that the same methods would be used for data exfiltration to the control server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
