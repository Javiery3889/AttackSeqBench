Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion Phase:** Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to load the malicious `wab32res.dll` through a benign file.
   - **Command and Control Phase:** TClient is likely to use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - DLL hijacking is a technique used to hide malicious activities by loading a malicious DLL through a benign file. This is a method to evade detection by security software.
     - Using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for communication with the C&C server is a common technique to avoid detection by network security measures, as it encrypts the traffic making it harder to intercept and analyze.
     - Both techniques (DLL hijacking and SSL for C&C communication) are consistent with the TTPs used by sophisticated malware to evade detection and maintain persistence.

   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that TClient would not use SSL for connecting to the C&C server. However, given the context of the question, it is highly likely that TClient would use SSL to ensure secure and undetected communication with the C&C server.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to evade detection. It is logical to assume that TClient, which is part of the same malware family or is controlled by the same C&C server, would also use SSL for secure and stealthy communication with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
