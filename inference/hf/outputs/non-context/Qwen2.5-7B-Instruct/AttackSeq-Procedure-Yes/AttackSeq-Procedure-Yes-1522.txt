Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers modified the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file on the Afghan Government's CDN server.
   - They delivered malicious code to targeted websites.
   - They obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing file.
   - They encoded the malicious code using Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did indeed obfuscate and encode the malicious code as described.
     - This aligns with common practices in advanced persistent threats (APTs) where attackers use obfuscation and packing to evade detection and analysis.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not obfuscate and encode the malicious code as described.
     - This would be less likely given the sophistication often seen in APTs, where attackers use such techniques to enhance the stealth and persistence of their malware.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The attackers' actions of modifying the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file and appending malicious code to it are consistent with a targeted attack where the attackers aim to deliver the payload to specific websites.
   - Obfuscation and encoding with Dean Edwards Packer are common techniques used to make the malicious code harder to detect and analyze by security tools and analysts.
   - These techniques are often employed to evade signature-based detection and to make reverse engineering more difficult.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
