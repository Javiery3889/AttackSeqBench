Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The attackers have already established persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control (C2) server. This means they have a way to maintain access to the network even if the initial entry point is detected and removed.

2. **Escalating Privileges**: They have also escalated privileges by compromising a Domain Administrator account. This gives them the highest level of access within the network, allowing them to move laterally and access sensitive information and systems.

3. **Cobalt Strike Beacon**: Cobalt Strike is a popular tool used for red team operations and penetration testing, but it is also used by attackers to maintain access and perform reconnaissance. A Cobalt Strike beacon can be used to gather information about the network, including discovering the internal network layout, collecting credentials, and compromising additional endpoints.

4. **Discovering the Internal Network**: With a Domain Administrator account, the attackers can use tools like `net view`, `net use`, or PowerShell commands to discover the internal network. Cobalt Strike can facilitate this by providing a beacon that can run these commands and report back to the attackers.

5. **Collecting Administrative Level Credentials**: With a Domain Administrator account, the attackers already have administrative credentials. However, they might still use Cobalt Strike to gather additional credentials from other systems or users, which could be useful for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

6. **Compromising Additional Network Endpoints**: Once the internal network is discovered and additional credentials are collected, the attackers can use these to compromise other network endpoints. Cobalt Strike can be used to deploy payloads and maintain access to these endpoints.

Given the above points, it is highly plausible that the attackers would use Cobalt Strike to perform these actions after establishing persistence and escalating privileges.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
