Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural) used by Gamaredon, a known cyber threat actor. The sequence includes:
1. Deployment of malware.
2. Search for sensitive documents.
3. Taking screenshots.
4. Exfiltration of harvested documents to a C&C (Command and Control) server.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
- Answer Choice B: No

Gamaredon is known for its sophisticated cyber operations, often involving the use of malware to gather intelligence and exfiltrate data. The TTPs described in the question are consistent with their known methods. Specifically, the exfiltration of harvested documents to a C&C server is a common tactic used by threat actors to ensure that stolen data is securely transmitted back to the attackers.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Gamaredon's operations typically involve a well-structured attack lifecycle, including the deployment of malware, data collection, and exfiltration.
- The question specifically mentions the exfiltration phase, which is a critical step in the attack lifecycle where stolen data is sent to the attackers.
- Given Gamaredon's known tactics, it is highly likely that they would automate the process of uploading harvested documents to their C&C server to maintain operational security and ensure the data is securely transmitted.

Final Answer: A: Yes
