To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial TTPs Described:**
   - Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.
   - This indicates the use of a backdoor for persistence and a registry-based persistence mechanism.

2. **Question's Focus:**
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

3. **Analysis of Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Deep Panda would deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion using DKOM.
     - The Fire Chili kernel rootkit is known for its ability to perform DKOM, which can help in evading detection by hiding processes, network connections, and other system objects.
     - Given the persistence mechanism already in place, deploying a kernel-level rootkit like Fire Chili would be a logical next step to further evade detection and enhance the attacker's capabilities.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Deep Panda would not deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for the described purposes.
     - While it is possible that Deep Panda might not use a kernel rootkit, the question specifically asks about the likelihood of using Fire Chili for Defense Evasion and system information discovery/screen capture functionalities.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The Fire Chili kernel rootkit is a powerful tool for achieving Defense Evasion and enhancing the attacker's capabilities, especially after establishing persistence.
   - Given the context of the question and the capabilities of the Fire Chili kernel rootkit, it is more plausible that Deep Panda would deploy it for the described purposes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
