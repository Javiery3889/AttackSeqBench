To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Data Collection**: The question states that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This is a typical behavior for data exfiltration malware.

2. **Communication with C&C Servers**: The question then asks about the communication method used by Korplug to interact with its Command and Control (C&C) servers. Specifically, it mentions:
   - Initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
   - Subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

3. **Custom TCP-based Protocol**: The question also mentions that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for communication.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described behavior. Korplug is known to use a custom protocol for communication, which could involve an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP. This is consistent with the behavior of many malware families that use custom protocols to avoid detection by standard network monitoring tools.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the described behavior. If Korplug does not use a custom TCP-based protocol with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP, it would be inconsistent with the known behavior of Korplug.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best aligned with Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
