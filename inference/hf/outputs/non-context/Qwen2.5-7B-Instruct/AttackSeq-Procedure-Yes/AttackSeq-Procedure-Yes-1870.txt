To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the scenario and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The malware, Scote, uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 (Command and Control) information to evade detection.
   - It retrieves C2 information from these services before communicating with C2 servers to accept commands.

2. **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Scote retrieves C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts.
     - Pastebin is a legitimate online service where users can post text snippets. It is often used for sharing code, text, and other information.
     - Google+ (now defunct) was a social networking platform that could be used to host or share information.
     - Both Pastebin and Google+ are legitimate third-party online services, which aligns with the described evasion technique of Scote malware.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Scote does not retrieve C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts.
     - This would imply that Scote uses other methods to retrieve C2 information, which is not specified in the question.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question explicitly states that Scote uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information.
   - Pastebin and Google+ are both legitimate third-party online services.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Scote could use these services to host and retrieve C2 information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Scote retrieves C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts.
   - Final Answer: A
