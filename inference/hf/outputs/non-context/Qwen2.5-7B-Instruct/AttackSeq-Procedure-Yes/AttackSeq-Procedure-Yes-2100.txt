Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name, system type, and anti-virus information.
   - A backdoor is installed.
   - The backdoor will communicate with a C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - Data such as screenshots and system information will be exfiltrated through the established C&C channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.
     - Encrypting the communication with the C&C server is a common practice to avoid detection by network monitoring tools and to ensure that the data being exfiltrated is not easily readable.
     - Encrypting the initial communication (e.g., establishing the backdoor) and the data exfiltration is a standard security measure in many cyber-attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not communicate with the C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.
     - This would be less secure and more likely to be detected by network security measures, which is not a typical behavior for sophisticated attackers.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, which is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks.
   - Installing a backdoor is a typical method to maintain persistence and control over the victim's system.
   - Communicating with a C&C server using an encrypted channel is a standard practice to ensure the security and stealth of the communication.
   - Exfiltrating data such as screenshots and system information through the established C&C channel is a common method for data theft.
   - Encrypting the communication before exfiltrating data is a standard security measure to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality of the data.

Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: A
