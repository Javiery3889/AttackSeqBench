To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the options.

1. **Backdoor Execution**: The question states that a backdoor named FinalBot.exe was executed and renamed to Srvstr.exe. This indicates that the attacker has already gained a foothold on the victim's system and has installed a backdoor to maintain persistence.

2. **HTA File Usage**: The question then asks if Sidewinder (presumably a known threat actor or malware family) is likely to use an HTA file to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system. HTA (HTML Application) files are typically used to execute scripts and can be used to gather information about the system.

3. **Communication to C2 Server**: The question also mentions that the information about installed antivirus products would be communicated to the C2 server. This suggests that the malware has the capability to exfiltrate data to a command and control server.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that Sidewinder is likely to use an HTA file to gather information about installed antivirus products. While it is plausible that an attacker might use an HTA file for such reconnaissance, the question does not provide enough context to definitively conclude that this is the next step in the sequence. The sequence described (backdoor execution -> HTA file -> C2 communication) is a logical progression, but it is not the only possible sequence.

- **B: No** - This choice suggests that Sidewinder is unlikely to use an HTA file for this purpose. However, without additional context or information about Sidewinder's specific TTPs, it is difficult to conclusively state that an HTA file would not be used.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that an HTA file could be used for reconnaissance, but the question does not provide enough context to definitively rule out other possibilities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
