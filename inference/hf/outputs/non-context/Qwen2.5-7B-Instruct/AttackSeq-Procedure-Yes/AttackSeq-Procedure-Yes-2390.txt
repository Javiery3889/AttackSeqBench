Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a series of discovery activities performed by a malware, specifically TDrop2, and then asks whether it is likely that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using an encrypted channel after these activities.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Discovery activities are typically conducted to gather information that can be used for further exploitation or to establish a foothold within the network. After such activities, it is common for malware to attempt to communicate with its C2 servers to report the gathered information or to receive further instructions. Encrypted communication channels are often used by malware to avoid detection by network security systems.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware would not use an encrypted channel for communication with C2 servers. However, this is less likely given the typical behavior of malware, which often employs encryption to maintain operational security and evade detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has performed discovery activities, which are preparatory steps for further exploitation.
- After gathering the necessary information, the malware is likely to communicate with its C2 servers to report the findings or to receive further instructions.
- Using an encrypted channel for this communication is a common practice among malware to avoid detection by network security systems.
- Therefore, it is more plausible that the malware would use an encrypted channel for communication with C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
