To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing Emails with Trojanized Installation Executables:**
   - This indicates that the attackers have successfully delivered malware to the target system through a spear-phishing campaign. The malware is likely a trojan, which is designed to perform malicious actions on the system.

2. **Execution Using Process Hollowing:**
   - Process hollowing is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity. This technique is often used to evade detection by security software that monitors process creation and behavior.

3. **Engaging in Discovery Activities:**
   - Once the malware is executed, it likely performs discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views to understand the target environment and plan further actions.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after initial access, TDrop2 would use process hollowing to execute and then proceed with discovery activities. This sequence is plausible because process hollowing is a common technique used by malware to evade detection, and it aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated malware that aims to remain undetected while gathering information.

- **B: No**
  - This choice suggests that TDrop2 would not use process hollowing after initial access. While it is possible that TDrop2 might not use process hollowing, the question does not provide enough information to definitively rule out this technique. Moreover, the use of process hollowing is a common tactic in advanced malware campaigns, making this choice less likely.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables is a common method for delivering malware.
2. Process hollowing is a well-known technique used by malware to evade detection.
3. Discovery activities are typical post-infection actions to understand the target environment.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
