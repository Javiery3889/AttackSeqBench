Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor performing process discovery and system information discovery.
- It then asks if it is likely that the backdoor would use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The CostaRicto Campaign, as detailed in CTI reports, is known for using SombRAT, a backdoor that often employs various techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
- One of the common techniques used by SombRAT and similar backdoors is to use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish C2 channels. This method helps in evading network monitoring and security systems that may be configured to block or inspect traffic on specific ports.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SombRAT backdoor is known for its ability to perform process and system information discovery, which aligns with the initial phase of the attack as described in the question.
- The use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a well-documented technique used by SombRAT and other sophisticated backdoors to establish C2 channels. This technique is particularly effective in evading detection by security systems that may not be configured to inspect DNS and HTTP traffic as closely as other protocols.
- Given the nature of SombRAT and the techniques it is known to employ, it is highly plausible that the backdoor would use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a C2 channel.

Final Answer: A: Yes
