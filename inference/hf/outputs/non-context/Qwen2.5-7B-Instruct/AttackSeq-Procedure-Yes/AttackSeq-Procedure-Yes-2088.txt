Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Carbanak group used Cobalt Strike beacon for network discovery and mapping.
   - After this, they are likely to move laterally across the infrastructure.
   - They target internal hosts and servers.
   - They prepare and collect documents related to internal applications and procedures.
   - The final step is exfiltration of these documents.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, especially for a group like Carbanak, which is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks.
     - The use of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance is a common practice.
     - Lateral movement to target internal hosts and servers is a standard step in an attack to gain deeper access and control.
     - Preparing and collecting sensitive documents is a crucial step before exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack.
     - Skipping the steps of lateral movement and document collection would be highly unusual and less effective for a group like Carbanak.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Carbanak group's actions are well-documented and follow a specific pattern.
   - They start with reconnaissance using Cobalt Strike.
   - They then move laterally to gain deeper access.
   - They target specific internal hosts and servers to gather sensitive information.
   - They prepare and collect the necessary documents.
   - Finally, they exfiltrate the data.
   - This sequence is logical and consistent with the Carbanak group's known tactics.

**Final Answer: A**
