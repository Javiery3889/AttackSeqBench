Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish communication with C2 servers.
   - SombRAT backdoor is mentioned as a potential tool for exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.
   - The question asks if it is likely that SombRAT will exfiltrate data using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that SombRAT is likely to use SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
     - Given that the CostaRicto Campaign already uses SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication, it is plausible that SombRAT, which is a sophisticated backdoor, would also use similar methods to ensure secure and undetected communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that SombRAT is unlikely to use SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
     - This would be less plausible because using such secure methods would align with the sophisticated nature of the CostaRicto Campaign and the need for secure and stealthy communication channels.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign is known for its use of advanced techniques such as protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, and SSL-encrypted traffic with RSA-secured AES key exchanges.
   - SombRAT, being a sophisticated backdoor, is likely to employ similar security measures to maintain stealth and secure communication.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that SombRAT would also use SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A**
