Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Gathering system information using PyFlash backdoor.
   - Communicating with a hardcoded C&C server.
   - Utilizing AES-128 encryption in CBC mode.
   - Using port 8,000 for command and control operations.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice assumes that after gathering system information, the backdoor (PyFlash) will indeed communicate with a hardcoded C&C server.
     - It further assumes that the communication will use AES-128 encryption in CBC mode.
     - Lastly, it assumes that the communication will occur on port 8,000.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice directly contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that are typical in a backdoor's operation: gathering information, establishing a connection, and using encryption for secure communication.
   - PyFlash is a known backdoor that can perform these actions, and it is reasonable to assume that it would follow a similar pattern as described.
   - The use of AES-128 in CBC mode and communication on port 8,000 are plausible choices for secure and less commonly monitored communication channels.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
