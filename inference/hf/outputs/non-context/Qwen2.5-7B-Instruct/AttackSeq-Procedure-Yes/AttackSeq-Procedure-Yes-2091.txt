Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already discovered and mapped the organization's internal network using Cobalt Strike beacons.
   - They have collected administrative-level credentials.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - After gaining initial access and administrative credentials, attackers typically aim to maximize their foothold within the network. Lateral movement is a common tactic to spread the infection and gain access to more critical systems.
     - Cobalt Strike beacons are known for their ability to facilitate lateral movement and maintain persistence.
     - With administrative credentials, the attackers can easily compromise numerous workstations and target internal hosts and servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not move laterally or compromise additional systems, which is less likely given the context of having administrative credentials and the use of Cobalt Strike for network exploration and persistence.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already established a foothold in the network and have administrative credentials, which are powerful tools for gaining access to other systems.
   - Cobalt Strike is designed to facilitate lateral movement and maintain persistence, making it highly likely that the attackers will use these capabilities to spread their infection.
   - The goal of most attackers is to maximize their control and access within the network, which typically involves moving laterally and compromising additional systems.

**Final Answer: A**
