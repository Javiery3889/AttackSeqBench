To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and the answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The 'IPsec Helper' is a TTP where the attacker uses IPsec to establish a secure channel for communication with C2 servers.
   - The attacker then sends reconnaissance information or downloads files as part of the attack.
   - Agrius is a known malware family that has been associated with destructive activities, including the use of wipers and other malware to overwrite files.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs:**
   - **'IPsec Helper':** This is a method used to establish a secure communication channel.
   - **Reconnaissance and File Downloading:** These are common initial steps in many cyber attacks to gather information and prepare the target environment.
   - **'Apostle' Wiper:** This is a known malware that is designed to overwrite files, causing data loss.
   - **'DEADWOOD' Malware:** This is another known malware that is also designed to overwrite files.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that after the initial steps, Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware to overwrite files.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that Agrius is unlikely to deploy these specific malware tools after the initial steps.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Agrius is known for its destructive capabilities, including the use of wipers to overwrite files. The 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are both associated with data destruction activities.
   - Given that the question mentions data destruction activities as part of the attack sequence, it is plausible that Agrius would use these tools to achieve its objectives.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the known behavior of Agrius, which includes the use of wipers and other destructive malware.

Final Answer: A
