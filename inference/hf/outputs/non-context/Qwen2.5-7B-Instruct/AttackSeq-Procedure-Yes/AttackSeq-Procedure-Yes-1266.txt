To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Blind Eagle's attack sequence, let's break down the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions a JavaScript downloader employing `ActiveXObject` to execute PowerShell commands hosted on Discord CDNs. This is a specific and detailed sequence of actions that could be part of an attack.

2. **Persistence**: The question then states that this is followed by a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute `SystemLogin.bat`. This is a common method for maintaining persistence on a system.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the detailed sequence of actions described in the question. It mentions the use of a JavaScript downloader, the execution of PowerShell commands via `ActiveXObject`, and the subsequent use of a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file for persistence. This sequence is plausible and matches the attack sequence described.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the sequence described in the question does not match Blind Eagle's attack sequence. However, without additional information about Blind Eagle's known TTPs, it is difficult to definitively state that this sequence is not used.

Given the detailed and specific nature of the sequence described in the question, and the lack of contradictory information about Blind Eagle's known TTPs, the most plausible answer is that the sequence described is indeed part of Blind Eagle's attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
