To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The scenario mentions that the campaign involves phishing emails. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a target's system.

2. **Delivery of Malware**: The phishing emails contain a malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. This file is likely to be a Microsoft Word document that, when opened, will execute a malicious payload.

3. **Execution of VBS Macros**: The question specifically asks if it is likely that VBS (Visual Basic Script) macros will be executed from the embedded Microsoft Word document. This is a plausible scenario because:
   - Many phishing documents are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office applications.
   - VBS macros are often used in such documents to perform malicious actions, such as downloading and executing additional malware, stealing data, or establishing a backdoor.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the scenario described. It is plausible that a phishing email containing a malicious Word document would execute VBS macros to carry out further malicious activities.
- **B: No**: This choice does not align with the scenario. There is no information provided that would suggest that VBS macros would not be executed in this context.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The campaign uses phishing emails, which is a common method for initial access.
2. The document is a Microsoft Word file, which can contain VBS macros.
3. VBS macros are a common method for executing malicious actions in such documents.

**Final Answer: A**
