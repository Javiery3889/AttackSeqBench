To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Exploiting CVE-2017-11882**: This is the initial access method, where the attacker uses a vulnerability in Microsoft Word to gain entry into the system.

2. **Deploying POWERSHOWER**: This is a PowerShell backdoor. Deploying a backdoor is a common step after gaining initial access to maintain control over the compromised system.

3. **Establishing Persistence**: The attacker writes a PowerShell script to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and uses a registry run key to ensure the script runs every time the system starts. This is a standard method to maintain long-term access.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This suggests that after gaining initial access, the attacker would deploy POWERSHOWER, then establish persistence. This sequence makes logical sense as it follows a typical attack pattern: first gaining access, then securing that access for the long term.

- **B: No**: This would imply that the attacker would not deploy POWERSHOWER after gaining initial access, which is less likely given the common practice of using backdoors to maintain control.

Given the typical attack patterns and the need to maintain control over the compromised system, the most plausible sequence is to deploy a backdoor and then establish persistence.

Final Answer: A
