To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP: Trojans KeePass Binaries**
   - The question mentions that FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation. This is a common tactic where attackers modify legitimate software to capture sensitive information.

2. **Credential Collection: Network Sniffing**
   - The question then asks if FIN13 is likely to employ network sniffing to obtain credentials. Network sniffing involves capturing data packets on a network to extract sensitive information such as passwords and other credentials. This is another common method for credential harvesting.

3. **Leveraging Native OS Binaries and Custom Malware**
   - The question states that after network sniffing, FIN13 would leverage native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance. This step involves using both existing system tools and custom malware to gather more detailed information about the network and the host.

4. **Evaluation of Answer Choices**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It suggests that after using trojanized KeePass binaries to log passwords, FIN13 would indeed use network sniffing to obtain credentials and then proceed to gather more detailed information using native OS binaries and custom malware.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence described in the question. It suggests that FIN13 would not use network sniffing after the initial trojanized KeePass binaries, which does not align with the described attack sequence.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best represented by answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
