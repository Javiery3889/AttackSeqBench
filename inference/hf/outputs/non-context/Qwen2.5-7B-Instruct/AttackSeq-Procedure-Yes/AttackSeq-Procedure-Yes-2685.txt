To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Scanning for vulnerable websites to identify targets or create C&C infrastructure.
   - Exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing emails.
   - Deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible.
     - Scanning for vulnerable websites is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks to identify potential targets.
     - Exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing emails is a sophisticated and targeted method to gain initial access, which aligns with the use of CVE-2018-20250, a known vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework.
     - Deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution is a typical follow-up step to establish a persistent presence and maintain control over the compromised system.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is not plausible.
     - While it is possible that other sequences of TTPs could be used, the described sequence is a plausible and common approach in targeted attacks.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance (scanning for vulnerable websites), which is a standard initial step in many cyber-attacks.
   - Exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) via spear-phishing emails is a sophisticated and targeted method to gain initial access, which is consistent with the use of a specific, known vulnerability.
   - Deploying malware tools (Notestuk and Stonedrill) for execution is a logical next step to establish persistence and maintain control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed likely to be followed by Elfin.
   - Final Answer: Yes
