To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the components and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **SideCopy**: This is a specific malware or technique that targets access credentials. The question does not provide any specific information about SideCopy, but it is implied to be a tool or method used to access credentials.

2. **Credential Access using njRAT**: njRAT (Netjet Remote Access Tool) is a known malware that can be used to gain access to systems and steal credentials. This step is clearly mentioned in the question.

3. **GoLang-based file recon plugins**: This refers to the use of Go programming language to perform file reconnaissance, which is a method to gather information about files and directories on a target system.

4. **Exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases**: Kavach is a security solution used by the Indian government. The question suggests that the exfiltrated data includes authentication databases from Indian government employees.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

**A: Yes**
- This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that SideCopy is used to target credentials, which are then accessed using njRAT. The reconnaissance is performed using GoLang-based plugins, and the exfiltration targets Kavach authentication databases from Indian government employees.

**B: No**
- This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible. However, there is no information provided that contradicts the sequence described.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs as described in the question is supported by answer choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
