To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Initial TTP**: The attack starts with the use of PowerShell injection techniques via the `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` module from the PowerSploit framework. This is a method to execute malicious code in memory without writing it to the disk, often used to evade traditional antivirus solutions.
2. **Subsequent TTPs**: The question then asks if the CostaRicto Campaign is likely to use the SombRAT backdoor for specific actions:
   - **Process Discovery**
   - **System Information Discovery**
   - **System Time Discovery**
3. **Final TTP**: After these actions, the campaign is said to use tools like `pscan` and `nmap` for network service scanning.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the SombRAT backdoor is used for the specified actions (process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery) before the network service scanning.
  - SombRAT is known for its capabilities in gathering information about the compromised system, which aligns with the actions mentioned.
  - The use of SombRAT for these tasks is a common TTP in many campaigns, as it provides the attacker with detailed information about the target environment.
  - After gathering this information, it makes sense to proceed with network service scanning to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the SombRAT backdoor is not used for the specified actions before the network service scanning.
  - This would imply that the campaign uses other methods for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery, which is less likely given the capabilities of SombRAT.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial TTP**: The use of `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` is a common method for initial access and execution.
2. **SombRAT Backdoor**: SombRAT is known for its ability to gather detailed information about the system, which aligns with the actions mentioned (process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery).
3. **Network Service Scanning**: After gathering the necessary information, the campaign would likely proceed with network service scanning to identify further targets or vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the CostaRicto Campaign uses the SombRAT backdoor for the specified actions before proceeding with network service scanning.

**Final Answer: A**
