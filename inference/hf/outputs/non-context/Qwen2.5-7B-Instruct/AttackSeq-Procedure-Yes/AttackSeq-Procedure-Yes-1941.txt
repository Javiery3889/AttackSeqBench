To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers**: The malware has already established communication with its Command and Control (C2) servers over HTTPS. This indicates a secure and potentially encrypted channel for command and control communication.

2. **Custom Data Encoding Algorithm for Obfuscation**: The malware uses a custom data encoding algorithm to obfuscate the data it collects. This step is likely to ensure that the data is not easily readable or traceable by security systems.

3. **Exfiltration via HTTP GET Request**: The question asks if the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via a HTTP GET request. HTTP GET is a common method for data exfiltration because it is simple and can be easily performed by the malware.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the malware will use a HTTP GET request to exfiltrate data. Given that the malware has already established a secure HTTPS connection and uses obfuscation, it is plausible that it would use a simple and common method like HTTP GET for exfiltration. This method is straightforward and can be easily automated by the malware.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the malware will not use a HTTP GET request for exfiltration. While it is possible that the malware might use a different method, the question does not provide any information that would rule out the use of HTTP GET. The malware's use of HTTPS and obfuscation does not necessarily preclude the use of HTTP GET for exfiltration.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will use a HTTP GET request for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
