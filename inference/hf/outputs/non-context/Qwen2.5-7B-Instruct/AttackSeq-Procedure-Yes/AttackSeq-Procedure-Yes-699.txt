Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elderwood Project attackers:
1. Deployment of zero-day exploits.
2. Use of watering hole attacks for initial access.
3. Establishment of C&C servers to maintain control and retrieve commands.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: "Yes" - This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Elderwood Project. After gaining initial access, establishing C&C servers is a standard practice to maintain long-term control over compromised systems and to facilitate further operations.
- Answer Choice B: "No" - This does not align with the typical behavior of APT groups. Without C&C servers, maintaining control and communication with compromised systems would be significantly more difficult.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Elderwood Project is known for its sophisticated and persistent nature, which often involves maintaining long-term access to target networks.
- Zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks are used to gain initial access, but these are just the first steps in an APT campaign.
- Establishing C&C servers is a crucial step to maintain control over the compromised systems and to facilitate further operations, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, and additional attacks.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that the Elderwood Project attackers would establish C&C servers to maintain control and retrieve commands from the attackers.

Final Answer: A
