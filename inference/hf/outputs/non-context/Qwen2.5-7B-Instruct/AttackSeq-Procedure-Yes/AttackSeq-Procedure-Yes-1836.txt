To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the SideWinder APT group exploited CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play. This is a clear and specific initial access technique.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: The question then asks if it is likely that the group used exploits from the C&C server, such as CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU, to root devices for privilege escalation. This is a plausible step, as rooting a device would provide the attackers with elevated privileges, which can be used to further compromise the system.

3. **Evasion Techniques**: The question mentions that the group employed techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection. These are common techniques used by APT groups to avoid detection by security systems.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described. It is reasonable to assume that after gaining initial access, the group would attempt to escalate privileges to maintain persistence and then use various evasion techniques to avoid detection.

- **B: No** - This choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs described. It would be unusual for an APT group to gain initial access and then not attempt to escalate privileges or use evasion techniques.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
