To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP: SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute.**
   - This indicates that the SLUB backdoor is actively seeking to gather information and potentially execute commands based on the downloaded snippet.

2. **Potential Next TTPs:**
   - **Data Exfiltration:** The question asks if the attackers are likely to exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders and building CAB files before posting download links to the Slack channel.
   - **Reasoning:**
     - Creating archive files of Desktop folders and building CAB files is a method of data exfiltration. CAB files are often used to compress and package files for distribution, which can be a method to hide the data being exfiltrated.
     - Posting download links to the Slack channel suggests a method of communication and distribution of the exfiltrated data.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the described TTPs. The creation of archive files and CAB files, followed by posting download links, is a plausible method for data exfiltration.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the described TTPs. If the attackers are using the SLUB backdoor to gather information and are creating archive files and CAB files, it is reasonable to assume they would use these methods for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
