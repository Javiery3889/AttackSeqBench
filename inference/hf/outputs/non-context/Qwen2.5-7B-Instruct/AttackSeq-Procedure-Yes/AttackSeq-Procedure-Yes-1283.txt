To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Exploit**: The question mentions the use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. This is a common initial attack vector where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in software to deliver malicious payloads.

2. **Execution of Malicious Payloads**: After the initial exploit, the installer package is executed, which likely contains the malicious payloads. This step is crucial as it sets the stage for the subsequent actions.

3. **Loader Execution**: The question then asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader. FakeRun is a known technique where a benign-looking application (like FakeRun) is used to launch a malicious process, often through the use of legitimate Windows processes like `dllhost.exe`. This technique is designed to evade detection by making the malicious activity appear as part of a legitimate process.

4. **Process Injection**: The final step mentioned is the injection of a malicious DLL backdoor into the `dllhost.exe` process. This is a common method for maintaining persistence and controlling the system, as `dllhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process that is less likely to be flagged by security software.

Given these steps, the sequence described aligns with typical TTPs used by advanced threat actors like Tropic Trooper. The use of a loader (FakeRun) to launch a malicious process and then injecting a backdoor into a legitimate process is a well-documented technique.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs.
- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
