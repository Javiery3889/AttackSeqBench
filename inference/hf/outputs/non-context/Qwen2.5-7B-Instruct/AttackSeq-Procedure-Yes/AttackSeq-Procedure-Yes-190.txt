To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The attack involves collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate these files at regular intervals.
   - The exfiltration is expected to use a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that Infamous Chisel indeed uses a Tor hidden service and SSH connections to exfiltrate the collected files at regular intervals.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that Infamous Chisel does not use a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration.

3. **Evaluating the Plausibility:**
   - **Infamous Chisel** is a known malware that has been associated with the use of Tor for exfiltrating data. The use of a Tor hidden service is a common method to anonymize data exfiltration.
   - SSH (Secure Shell) is also a common method for secure data transfer and can be used for exfiltration.
   - The question specifies that the exfiltration is to occur at regular intervals, which is a plausible behavior for malware designed to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the known TTPs of Infamous Chisel, the described sequence of using a Tor hidden service and SSH for exfiltration at regular intervals is highly plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
