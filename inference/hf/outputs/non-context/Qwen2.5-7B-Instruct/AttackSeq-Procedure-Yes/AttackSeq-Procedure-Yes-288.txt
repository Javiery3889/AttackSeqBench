To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Targeting Diplomatic and Economic Entities**: This is the initial reconnaissance phase where the attacker gathers information about potential victims. This is a common first step in many cyber-attacks to identify and understand the target environment.

2. **Gathering Victim Identity Information**: This step involves collecting data such as email addresses, job roles, and other personal information. This information is often used to craft more convincing spear-phishing emails.

3. **Dropping Elephant**: This is a reference to a specific malware or threat actor. Dropping Elephant is known for its use of spear-phishing emails and other social engineering techniques to gain initial access to a network.

4. **Spear-Phishing Emails Containing Malicious Documents**: This is a common technique used by Dropping Elephant to trick victims into opening attachments that contain malware. The use of spear-phishing emails is a well-documented tactic for this threat actor.

5. **UPX-Packed Backdoors**: UPX (Ultimate Pack for eXecutables) is a common packer used to compress and protect executable files. After gaining initial access through spear-phishing, the attacker might use UPX-packed backdoors to ensure that the malware is not easily detected by antivirus software.

6. **Downloading Additional Malware**: Once initial access is gained, the attacker often uses the backdoor to download and install additional malware to maintain persistence and gain deeper access to the network.

Given this analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of the Dropping Elephant threat actor.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
