To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step.

1. **ChromeLoader's Action**: The question states that ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image. This is a specific TTP where ChromeLoader uses social engineering or a malicious payload to bypass security measures.

2. **CloudMensis's Action**: The question then asks if CloudMensis is likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC (System Policy Configuration) restrictions. This is another specific TTP where an actor uses a known vulnerability to gain additional privileges or bypass security controls.

3. **C2 Communication**: The question also mentions that CloudMensis uses public cloud storage services for C2 (Command and Control) communication. This is a common TTP where attackers use cloud services to maintain persistence and communicate with their command and control servers.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after ChromeLoader's action, CloudMensis would indeed exploit CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions and then use public cloud storage services for C2 communication. This sequence of TTPs is logically consistent and follows a plausible attack chain.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that CloudMensis would not exploit CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions after ChromeLoader's action. This would imply a different sequence of TTPs, which is less aligned with the described attack sequence.

Given the logical flow and the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is that CloudMensis would indeed exploit CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions and then use public cloud storage services for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A**
