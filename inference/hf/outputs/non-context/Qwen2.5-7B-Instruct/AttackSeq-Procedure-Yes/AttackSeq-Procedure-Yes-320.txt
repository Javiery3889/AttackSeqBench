Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors.
   - Establishing a backdoor connection to a command-and-control (C2) server.
   - Injecting additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the typical sequence of actions in a sophisticated malware attack. After gaining initial access through a supply chain vulnerability and establishing a backdoor, the malware would likely communicate with a C2 server to receive further instructions and payloads. This is a common practice in malware operations to ensure the attacker can control the infected device and deploy additional functionality.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware would not use a backdoor connection to a C2 server, which contradicts the typical behavior of malware that needs remote control and updates. Without a C2 connection, the malware would be limited in its capabilities and would not be able to receive new instructions or updates.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the BADBOX malware and typical malware behavior, is that it would use a backdoor connection to a C2 server to receive further instructions and payloads.

**Final Answer: A**
