To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - TG1021 used a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.
   - The question asks if it is likely that they demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after using a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, TG1021 also removed all disk-resident tools to avoid detection.
     - Privilege escalation is often followed by steps to maintain persistence and avoid detection. Removing disk-resident tools can be a method to avoid leaving traces that could be detected by security tools or forensic analysis.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that after using a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, TG1021 did not remove all disk-resident tools to avoid detection.
     - This would imply that they left disk-resident tools in place, which could be a less effective strategy for avoiding detection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Privilege escalation is a critical step in an attack, often followed by steps to maintain access and avoid detection.
   - Removing disk-resident tools is a common technique to avoid leaving traces that could be detected by security tools or forensic analysis.
   - It is plausible that after privilege escalation, an attacker would take steps to remove disk-resident tools to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that TG1021 would likely remove all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy after using a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.

Final Answer: A
