Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The NewCT RAT is described as using two specific TTPs:
     - Evasion by checking CPU core count during execution.
     - Using large null-padded files to bypass AV engines.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the NewCT RAT will emit a network beacon during command and control communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The TTPs mentioned (CPU core count evasion and null-padded files) are primarily focused on evading detection and analysis. These techniques do not inherently preclude the RAT from performing command and control (C2) communications.
     - Emitting a network beacon is a common TTP for establishing and maintaining a C2 channel, which is a fundamental requirement for any RAT to function.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the NewCT RAT will not perform C2 communications, which contradicts the typical behavior of a RAT. The evasion techniques mentioned do not logically lead to the conclusion that the RAT will not communicate with its C2 server.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The evasion techniques (CPU core count check and null-padded files) are designed to avoid detection and analysis but do not address the need for the RAT to communicate with its C2 server.
   - Emitting a network beacon is a standard TTP for establishing and maintaining a C2 channel, which is essential for the RAT to function.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that the NewCT RAT will emit a network beacon during command and control communication.

**Final Answer: A**
