To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Initial Attack Vector**: The attackers are using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. This is a common tactic to bypass certain filters that might detect text-based phishing attempts.

2. **Verification of Victims' Credentials**: The next step in the sequence is the verification of victims' credentials in real-time. This suggests that the attackers are attempting to gain direct access to the victims' accounts by tricking them into entering their login credentials.

3. **Prompt for 2-Step Verification Code**: The final step is prompting the victims for their 2-step verification code. This is a common tactic used by attackers to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and gain full access to the victim's account.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. After tricking victims into clicking on a malicious image in an email, the attackers would likely verify the credentials in real-time to gain access to the account. Prompting for the 2-step verification code is a logical next step to bypass MFA and complete the takeover of the account.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. If the attackers are using images to evade detection and are verifying credentials in real-time, it would be highly unlikely that they would not prompt for the 2-step verification code, as this is a common method to bypass MFA.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attackers use images to evade Google's security systems.
2. They verify victims' credentials in real-time to gain access.
3. Prompting for the 2-step verification code is a common tactic to bypass MFA and complete the attack.

**Final Answer: Yes**
