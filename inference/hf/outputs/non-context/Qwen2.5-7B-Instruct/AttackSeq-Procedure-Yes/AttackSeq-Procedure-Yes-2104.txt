Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The attackers have established persistence using a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to execute a DLL function via 'rundll32.exe'. This is a common technique to ensure the malware remains active even after a system reboot.

2. **Anti-Sandboxing Techniques**: Anti-sandboxing techniques are used by malware to detect and avoid running in an environment that is designed to monitor or analyze the behavior of suspicious code, such as a sandbox. This is a common tactic to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Dynamic API Resolution**: Dynamic API resolution is a technique where the malware resolves the addresses of functions at runtime rather than at compile time. This can help the malware avoid detection by anti-virus software that relies on static signatures.

4. **Gathering Information for Discovery Purposes**: Once the malware is running, it likely gathers information about the victim's computer to understand the environment and tailor its actions accordingly.

Given these points, it is highly plausible that the attackers would employ both anti-sandboxing techniques and dynamic API resolution to evade detection. These techniques are commonly used in sophisticated malware to ensure that the malware can operate undetected.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the likelihood that the attackers would use these techniques to evade detection.
- **B: No** - This choice suggests that the attackers would not use these techniques, which is less likely given the common practices of sophisticated malware.

**Final Answer: A**
