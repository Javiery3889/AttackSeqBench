Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves evading defenses by operating in memory and using a specific DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
   - After these initial steps, the question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Operating in memory and using a DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk are sophisticated techniques often used by malware to evade detection.
     - Communicating with C2 servers and downloading payloads are common behaviors of malware, especially those associated with Ursnif (a banking trojan) and GandCrab (a ransomware).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the PowerShell script would not communicate with C2 servers or download additional payloads, which contradicts the typical behavior of sophisticated malware.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial steps (operating in memory and using a DCOM object) are consistent with the tactics of advanced malware.
   - The question implies that the PowerShell script is part of a larger attack sequence, which often involves communication with C2 servers to receive further instructions or payloads.
   - Both Ursnif and GandCrab are known for their ability to download additional payloads and communicate with C2 servers, making this behavior plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the initial steps and the typical behavior of the mentioned malware, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the PowerShell script will indeed communicate with C2 servers and download additional payloads.

Final Answer: A
