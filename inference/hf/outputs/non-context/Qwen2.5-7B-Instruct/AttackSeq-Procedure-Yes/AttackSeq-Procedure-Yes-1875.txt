Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - FIN13 uses utilities such as ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory.
   - FIN13 executes passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution.

2. **Evaluate the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks after the mentioned TTPs.

3. **Analyze Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - Deploying web shells and exploiting external servers are common initial access methods used by threat actors to gain entry into a network. However, the TTPs mentioned (ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE) are more indicative of post-exploitation activities rather than initial access.
   - **B: No**
     - While the TTPs mentioned (ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE) are post-exploitation activities, the question is asking about the likelihood of initial access. Deploying web shells and exploiting external servers are typical initial access methods, which are not directly related to the TTPs mentioned.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The TTPs mentioned (ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE) are more aligned with post-exploitation activities, such as maintaining persistence and lateral movement within a network.
   - Initial access methods, such as exploiting external servers and deploying web shells, are typically separate from these post-exploitation activities and are more likely to be the first step in an attack.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the TTPs mentioned are post-exploitation activities, it is less likely that these are the initial access methods used by FIN13.

**Final Answer: B: No**
