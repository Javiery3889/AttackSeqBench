To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Accessing the Victim's VPN Using Credentials Obtained Through Password Spraying:**
   - Password spraying is a technique where an attacker uses a small set of common passwords to try and gain access to a large number of accounts. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, especially when the attacker is trying to gain access to a network or system.

2. **Installing Cobalt Strike Beacon Using a PowerShell One-Liner:**
   - Cobalt Strike is a tool used for ethical hacking and red team operations, but it can also be used maliciously. A PowerShell one-liner is a common method for executing malicious code on a target system without the need for a traditional installer, making it a stealthy method for adversaries to establish a foothold.

3. **Leveraging Scheduled Tasks to Execute a Batch File:**
   - Once the Cobalt Strike beacon is installed, the adversary might use scheduled tasks to ensure that the malware remains active and can be triggered at a later time. This is a common tactic to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. The steps of accessing the network through password spraying, installing the Cobalt Strike beacon, and then using scheduled tasks to execute a batch file are all plausible and commonly used in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios.

- **B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. It would imply that the adversary did not use password spraying to access the network, did not use a PowerShell one-liner to install the Cobalt Strike beacon, and did not use scheduled tasks to execute a batch file. This sequence is less likely and does not match the described attack sequence.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
