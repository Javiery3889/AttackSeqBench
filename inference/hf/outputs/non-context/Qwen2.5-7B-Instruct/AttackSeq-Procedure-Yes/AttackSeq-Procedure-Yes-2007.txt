Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a phishing campaign is used to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems. It then asks if it is likely that the adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution to enable further malicious activities.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - BlackEnergy 3 is known for its use of VBA macros to establish C2 connections. The malware often uses these macros to execute malicious code and establish a connection with the C2 server. This aligns with the typical behavior of BlackEnergy 3.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the known behavior of BlackEnergy 3. There is no evidence or indication that BlackEnergy 3 would not use VBA scripts for C2 connections.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- BlackEnergy 3 is a well-documented malware that has been associated with the use of VBA macros to establish C2 connections. This is a common technique used by the malware to ensure persistence and maintain control over infected systems.
- The question describes a scenario where the malware has been delivered via a phishing campaign, which is a common initial attack vector for BlackEnergy 3.
- Given the known tactics of BlackEnergy 3, it is highly plausible that the adversaries would use malicious VBA scripts to establish a C2 connection to enable further malicious activities.

Final Answer: A
