Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The PowerLess Backdoor achieves credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll'.
   - It utilizes a keylogger.
   - It is asked if it is likely to target local user accounts on compromised systems for account discovery.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - The PowerLess Backdoor has already achieved credential access, which implies it has access to some form of credentials. Utilizing a keylogger further enhances its ability to capture additional credentials and sensitive information.
     - Targeting local user accounts for account discovery is a common tactic in post-exploitation phases of an attack, as it helps the attacker gain more privileges and control over the compromised system.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the PowerLess Backdoor would not target local user accounts for account discovery. However, given the capabilities it already possesses (credential access and keylogging), it would be unusual for it to not further explore the compromised system for additional accounts and credentials.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The PowerLess Backdoor has already demonstrated the ability to access credentials and capture keystrokes, which are valuable for gaining more control over the system.
   - Expanding the scope to discover more local user accounts would be a logical next step to maximize the attacker's control and access within the compromised network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
