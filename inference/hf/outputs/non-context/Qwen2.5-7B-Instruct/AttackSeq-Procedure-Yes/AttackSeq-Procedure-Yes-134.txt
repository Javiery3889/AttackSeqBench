To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: APT-TOCS uses "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems. This is a common method where attackers leverage legitimate tools to execute malicious code.

2. **Execution in Memory**: The question asks if it is likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory during the core step of the attack without being written to the hard disk. This is a plausible technique known as "in-memory execution," which helps in evading traditional disk-based detection mechanisms.

3. **Multi-Beacon Communication**: After the in-memory execution, the attackers employ multi-beacon communication for defense evasion. This technique involves establishing multiple, short-lived communication channels to avoid detection by network monitoring tools that look for long-lived connections.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. In-memory execution is a common tactic to avoid leaving traces on the disk, and multi-beacon communication is a well-known method for evading network monitoring and detection.

- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. If the Shellcode scripts were not executed in memory, they would likely be written to the disk, making them more detectable and easier to analyze.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
