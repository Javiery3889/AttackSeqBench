To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that TG1021 exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability. This is a specific and targeted method of gaining initial access.

2. **Reconnaissance**: The question then asks if it is likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory to gather information on targets. SharpHound is a tool used for gathering information about the Active Directory, while PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell-based penetration testing modules. Both are commonly used for reconnaissance and post-exploitation activities.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves a targeted attack (exploiting a 0-day vulnerability) followed by reconnaissance to gather information about the target environment. This is a common and logical sequence in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns.

4. **Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the reconnaissance step is likely to have occurred after the initial access.
   - **B: No**: This choice suggests that the reconnaissance step did not occur after the initial access.

Given the nature of the attack described (a targeted exploit followed by gathering information about the target environment), it is highly plausible that TG1021 would perform reconnaissance to understand the target environment before fully exploiting it. Tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit are commonly used for such purposes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
