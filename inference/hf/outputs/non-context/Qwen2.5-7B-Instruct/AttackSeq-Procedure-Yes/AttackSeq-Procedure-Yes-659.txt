To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Initial Attack Vector**: The question states that Gallmaker uses spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious Office documents. This is a common initial attack vector for many threat actors.

2. **Exploitation of DDE Protocol**: The next step mentioned is the exploitation of the DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol to execute commands in memory. This is a sophisticated technique to bypass traditional antivirus and endpoint protection mechanisms.

3. **Execution of PowerShell-based Metasploit Payloads**: After gaining a foothold, the attack uses PowerShell to execute Metasploit payloads. This is a common tactic for post-exploitation to maintain persistence and gain deeper access to the network.

4. **Living Off the Land (LotL) Tactics**: The question then asks if Gallmaker is likely to use LotL tactics. LotL refers to the use of legitimate tools and processes on the target system to hide malicious activities. This is a common tactic to evade detection.

5. **Tool Removal**: The final part of the question asks if Gallmaker is likely to remove tools from the victim’s machines after executing the payloads. This is a defensive measure to avoid leaving traces and to evade detection.

**Answer Choices Analysis**:
- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that Gallmaker would use LotL tactics and remove tools from the victim’s machines. This aligns with common post-exploitation tactics where threat actors aim to minimize their footprint and avoid detection.
- **B: No** - This choice suggests that Gallmaker would not use LotL tactics and would leave tools on the victim’s machines. This is less likely as it increases the risk of detection and analysis.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The use of spear-phishing and DDE exploitation is a sophisticated initial attack vector.
2. Executing Metasploit payloads via PowerShell is a common post-exploitation technique.
3. Using LotL tactics is a standard practice to avoid detection.
4. Removing tools from the victim’s machines is a defensive measure to avoid leaving traces.

**Final Answer: A**
