To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of CosmicDuke's known behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Achieving Persistence**: The question mentions that CosmicDuke has achieved persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing the 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.' This is a common TTP for CosmicDuke, as it aligns with the persistence technique T1543.003 (Scheduled Task) and T1543.004 (Service).

2. **File Search and Targeting Non-English Filenames**: The question then asks if CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations. CosmicDuke is known to target specific files and directories, and it often uses non-English filenames to evade detection. This aligns with the TTPs T1083 (System Information Discovery) and T1005 (File and Directory Discovery), where the adversary might use non-English characters to hide or obfuscate their activities.

3. **Information Collection**: The question also mentions that CosmicDuke will collect information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. CosmicDuke is known to use these tools for data exfiltration and reconnaissance, which aligns with the TTPs T1056 (Keylogging), T1113 (Screen Capture), and T1112 (Clipboard Manipulation).

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with CosmicDuke's known behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
