Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
   - Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.

2. **Evaluate the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Aurora malware will communicate with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme after the described TTPs.

3. **Context and Analysis:**
   - Aurora malware is known for its sophisticated and stealthy tactics. While the described TTPs (file-time modification and DLL injection into svchost.exe) are indeed part of Aurora's modus operandi, the communication method is a different aspect.
   - Aurora malware is often associated with using strong, custom encryption schemes for C&C communications to avoid detection by standard security measures. This is a hallmark of its advanced nature and the need to maintain operational security.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that Aurora malware would use a weak custom encryption scheme for C&C communications, which contradicts the known characteristics of Aurora malware.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that Aurora malware would not use a weak custom encryption scheme for C&C communications, which aligns with the known behavior of Aurora malware.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the known characteristics of Aurora malware, the likelihood of it using a weak custom encryption scheme for C&C communications is low.

**Final Answer: B: No**
