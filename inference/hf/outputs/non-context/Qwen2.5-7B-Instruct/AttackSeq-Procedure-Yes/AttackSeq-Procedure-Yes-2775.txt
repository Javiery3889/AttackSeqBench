Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Self-deleting code:** This is a technique used to remove traces of the attacker's presence, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - **Gathering system information:** This is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement:** This is part of the Lateral Movement tactic.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The Dragonfly group is known for targeting Windows systems and using sophisticated techniques to gather information and move laterally.
     - Self-deleting code is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors to avoid detection.
     - Gathering system information is a typical step in the initial reconnaissance phase.
     - Using RDP for lateral movement is a common method for moving between systems, especially in environments where RDP is enabled.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the Dragonfly group did not use these specific tactics, which contradicts their known methods and techniques.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described aligns with the known tactics and techniques of the Dragonfly group, making Answer Choice A the most plausible.

Final Answer: Yes
