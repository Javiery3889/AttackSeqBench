To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware. This is the initial step in the attack.
2. **Persistence**: After gaining initial access, the next step is to establish persistence to ensure the attacker can maintain access even if the system is rebooted or the malware is detected and removed.
3. **Command and Control (C2)**: The attacker needs a method to communicate with the compromised system and execute commands.

**Answer Choice A: Yes**

- **Passive Backdoor (BLUEAGAVE)**: BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution. This is a method to maintain persistence and provide a C2 channel.
- **Persistence (SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries)**: SIXPACK is a persistence mechanism that can be used to ensure the attacker's access is maintained over time. Trojans like trojanized KeePass binaries can also be used to maintain persistence by embedding malicious code within legitimate software.

**Answer Choice B: No**

- This choice suggests that after deploying web shells and custom malware, FIN13 would not use BLUEAGAVE for persistence and instead would not use SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries. This is less likely because both methods are effective for maintaining long-term access and providing a C2 channel.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Initial Access**: Web shells and custom malware are deployed to gain initial access.
2. **Persistence**: To maintain access, persistence mechanisms like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries are used.
3. **C2 Channel**: A passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE provides a method for the attacker to communicate with the compromised system and execute commands.

Given the need for persistence and a C2 channel, the sequence of TTPs described in Answer Choice A is more plausible.

**Final Answer: Yes**
