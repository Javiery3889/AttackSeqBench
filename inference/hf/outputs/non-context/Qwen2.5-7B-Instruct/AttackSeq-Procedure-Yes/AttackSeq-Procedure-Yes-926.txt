To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the Volatile Cedar campaign, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Infection and Lateral Movement**:
   - The question mentions that the campaign uses initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread across the network or infect USB devices for lateral movement. This indicates a manual or initial phase of the attack where the attackers gain initial footholds and spread within the network.

2. **Command and Control (C2) Operations**:
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the campaign will leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations through application layer protocols. This suggests a more sophisticated phase where the attackers establish a robust and resilient communication channel with their command and control infrastructure.

3. **Volatile Cedar Campaign Context**:
   - The Volatile Cedar campaign is known for its sophisticated and targeted nature, often involving the use of custom malware and advanced techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection. Given the nature of this campaign, it is highly plausible that they would use a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations. This approach allows for better resilience, easier management, and more sophisticated command and control capabilities.

4. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes** - This aligns with the sophisticated nature of the Volatile Cedar campaign and the need for robust and resilient C2 infrastructure.
   - **B: No** - This would imply that the campaign does not use such a sophisticated C2 infrastructure, which contradicts the known tactics of this campaign.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial infection and lateral movement are described, indicating an initial phase of the attack.
2. The question then asks about the C2 operations, which is a more advanced phase.
3. Given the nature of the Volatile Cedar campaign, it is highly likely that they would use a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations.
4. Answer choice A aligns with this reasoning, while B does not.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
