Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware has already collected basic system information and searched for Bitcoin wallet addresses.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will save screen recording files in the specified format during the data collection phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     1. Collecting basic system information.
     2. Searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses.
     3. Saving screen recording files in the format [%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The first two TTPs (collecting system information and searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses) are common in many malware operations, especially those targeting financial information.
   - However, the third TTP (saving screen recording files) is not directly related to the initial data collection phase. Screen recording is more likely to be used for reconnaissance or to capture sensitive information after the initial data collection phase, such as during the exfiltration or lateral movement phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the screen recording files are saved during the data collection phase. While the malware has already collected basic system information and searched for Bitcoin wallet addresses, these actions do not inherently require or necessitate the saving of screen recording files.
   - Screen recording is more likely to be a tactic used to capture sensitive information or actions on the system after the initial data collection phase, rather than during it.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the nature of the TTPs, it is unlikely that the malware would save screen recording files during the data collection phase.

Final Answer: B: No
