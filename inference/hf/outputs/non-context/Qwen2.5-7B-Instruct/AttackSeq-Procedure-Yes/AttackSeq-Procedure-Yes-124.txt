To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTPs Mentioned:**
   - The use of an 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - Communication with C2 servers over HTTP.
   - Actions such as updating relays or downloading files.

2. **Subsequent TTPs:**
   - Deployment of wipers like 'Apostle'.
   - Transformation of 'Apostle' into functioning ransomware.

3. **Analysis of Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the initial TTPs, Agrius deployed wipers and later transformed them into ransomware.
     - This sequence is plausible because it follows a common pattern in cyber-attacks where initial access is used to establish a foothold, and then more destructive or financially motivated malware is deployed.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Agrius did not deploy wipers or transform 'Apostle' into ransomware after the initial TTPs.
     - This is less plausible given the information provided, as it would imply a deviation from the typical attack lifecycle where initial access is used to gain more control and then deploy more sophisticated malware.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns more closely with the deployment of wipers and the transformation of 'Apostle' into ransomware, which is a common progression in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns.

Final Answer: A
