Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural steps) used by CosmicDuke, a known cyber threat actor.
   - The first TTP mentioned is searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard and exfiltrate the collected information via FTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - CosmicDuke is known for its targeted attacks and data exfiltration techniques. The use of a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard is a plausible method for data exfiltration, especially in scenarios where the target might use the clipboard to copy sensitive information.
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a common method for exfiltrating data, and CosmicDuke has been known to use FTP for data exfiltration in the past.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke would not use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard and exfiltrate it via FTP. However, given CosmicDuke's known tactics and techniques, this seems less likely.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - CosmicDuke is known for its targeted and sophisticated attack methods.
   - The use of a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard is a plausible method for data exfiltration, especially in scenarios where sensitive information might be copied to the clipboard.
   - Exfiltrating the collected information via FTP is a common method used by CosmicDuke for data exfiltration.
   - Given the known tactics of CosmicDuke, the described sequence of TTPs (searching removable drives, clipboard stealer, and FTP exfiltration) aligns well with their known methods.

**Final Answer: A**
