To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Replacing the path to the DLL of an unused service**: This is a common technique to load malicious code into a system without raising suspicion. The unused service is likely to be less monitored, making it a good candidate for embedding malicious code.

2. **Hiding Comfoo's files on disk using a rootkit**: This step ensures that the malicious files are not easily detected by the user or security software, providing stealth.

3. **Executing the "ipnat" system service to block remote inbound connections**: This step is aimed at preventing detection by external entities, such as security researchers or network administrators, by making the system appear less suspicious. It is a defensive measure to avoid being noticed.

4. **Performing activities such as system information gathering and keystroke logging**: These are the primary objectives of the malware, which would be carried out after the system is sufficiently compromised and stealthy.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after the initial steps of replacing the DLL and hiding files, the malware would then block remote inbound connections using the "ipnat" service. This sequence makes logical sense as it aligns with the typical behavior of malware to secure its foothold and avoid detection before performing its primary objectives.

- **B: No**: This choice would imply that the malware would not block remote inbound connections after the initial steps, which seems less likely given the typical behavior of malware to secure its environment before performing malicious activities.

Given the logical flow of the attack sequence and the typical behavior of malware, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
