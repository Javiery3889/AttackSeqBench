To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each answer choice.

1. **XAgent app executes by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices.**
   - This indicates that the malware is designed to be stealthy and persistent on the device.

2. **Is it likely that the app will collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server?**
   - This step involves the malware identifying and collecting information about running processes on the device, which is a common tactic for understanding the environment and identifying potential targets or vulnerabilities.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- If the malware is designed to be stealthy and persistent, it is highly likely that it would gather information about the device's environment, including a list of running processes. This information is crucial for the malware to understand the system it is operating on and to tailor its actions accordingly. Sending this data to the C2 server is a standard practice for malware to report back to its operators, providing them with insights into the infected device's state.

**B: No**
- This would imply that the malware does not gather information about the device's processes, which seems unlikely for a stealthy and persistent malware. Without this information, the malware would have limited understanding of the environment it is operating in, making it less effective.

### Conclusion:
Given the stealthy and persistent nature of XAgent and the typical behavior of malware to gather and report information about the device's environment, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the app will indeed collect a list of processes and send this information to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A**
