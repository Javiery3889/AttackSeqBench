To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the components and evaluate each step.

1. **Defense Evasion Phase**: The question mentions the use of image files to conceal malicious components. This is a known technique where attackers use benign-looking files to hide malicious payloads. This aligns with the Defense Evasion phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Process Hollowing**: The question then asks if the campaign is likely to use Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload. Process Hollowing is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity. This is a plausible next step after concealing the malicious component, as it allows the attacker to execute the payload without raising suspicion.

3. **AES Encryption for Communication**: Finally, the question asks if the campaign is likely to employ AES encryption for communication with the C&C server. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used encryption algorithm that provides strong security for data in transit. Encrypting communication with the C&C server is a common practice to avoid detection by network security measures.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs (Defense Evasion, Process Hollowing, and AES encryption for C&C communication) is plausible and follows a logical progression.
- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the sequence is not plausible, which would mean that one or more of the steps are not likely to occur in this order or at all.

Given the logical progression and the commonality of these techniques in advanced persistent threats (APTs), the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed the one described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
