Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that include:
     - Ensuring persistence by auto-starting at device boot through listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.
     - Collecting device information such as GPS location.
     - Uploading the exfiltrated data to a C&C (Command and Control) server using the HTTP protocol.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that the app is likely to perform all the mentioned actions: ensuring persistence, collecting GPS location, and exfiltrating the data via HTTP.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that the app is unlikely to perform the actions mentioned, which is inconsistent with the described behavior.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the app ensures persistence by listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast. This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it remains active on the device.
   - The question then mentions that the app collects device information such as GPS location. This is a typical data exfiltration technique used by malicious apps to gather sensitive information.
   - Finally, the question states that the app uploads the exfiltrated data to a C&C server using the HTTP protocol. This is a common method for data exfiltration, as HTTP is widely used and can be easily monitored and analyzed.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the app is likely to perform all the actions mentioned.

**Final Answer: A**
