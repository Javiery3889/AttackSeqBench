To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access via Microsoft Word Document**: The question mentions that the attack utilized a Microsoft Word document to exploit CVE-2017-0199 for initial access. This is a common method where a malicious document is used to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Execution of Embedded .hta File**: The next step in the sequence is the execution of an embedded .hta (HTML Application) file using `mshta.exe`. This is a plausible follow-up action because .hta files can be used to execute arbitrary code and are often used in malicious scripts to bypass certain security measures.

3. **Persistence via Scheduled Task**: The attack then schedules a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS (Visual Basic Script) file every 3 minutes. This is a common persistence mechanism where attackers use legitimate-looking scheduled tasks to ensure their malware remains active on the system even after a reboot or other security actions.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It logically follows the steps of initial access, execution of a malicious payload, and then establishing persistence.
- **B: No**: This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible, which contradicts the logical flow of the attack described.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

Final Answer: A
