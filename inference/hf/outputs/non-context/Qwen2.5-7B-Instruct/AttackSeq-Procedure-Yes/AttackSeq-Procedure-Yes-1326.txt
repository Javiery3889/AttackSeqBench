To answer this question, let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - CosmicDuke is targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.
   - The techniques described under "Data from Removable Media" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework are relevant here.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CosmicDuke's Actions:**
     - CosmicDuke is known to target files on hard drives and network drives. This indicates a focus on persistent and long-term access to data.
   - **Data from Removable Media:**
     - The MITRE ATT&CK framework includes techniques for collecting data from removable media (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives, etc.). These techniques are often used to gather additional data that might not be available on primary storage or network drives.
   - **Likelihood of Searching Removable Drives:**
     - Given that CosmicDuke is already targeting hard drives and network drives, it is plausible that the malware would also search removable drives for additional files. Removable drives can contain sensitive data that might not be accessible through other means.
   - **Answer Choices:**
     - **A: Yes** - This aligns with the likelihood that CosmicDuke would search removable drives for additional files.
     - **B: No** - This would imply that CosmicDuke does not search removable drives, which contradicts the plausible behavior described above.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - CosmicDuke's known behavior includes targeting files on hard drives and network drives.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework includes techniques for collecting data from removable media, which are often used to gather additional data.
   - It is reasonable to assume that CosmicDuke, being a sophisticated malware, would also search removable drives for additional files to ensure a comprehensive data collection effort.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that CosmicDuke would indeed search removable drives for files.

**Final Answer: A**
