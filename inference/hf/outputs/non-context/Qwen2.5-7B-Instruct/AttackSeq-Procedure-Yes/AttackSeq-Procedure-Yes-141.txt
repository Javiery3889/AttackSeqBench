Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files. This is a specific method of initial access.

2. **Defense Evasion**: The question then asks if attackers are likely to shift to using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion. This is a different method that could be used to bypass security measures.

3. **Targeting Specific Groups**: Finally, the question asks if the attackers will target specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection. This is a common tactic in targeted attacks to increase the likelihood of success.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) described in the question is plausible.
  - Exploiting a vulnerability for initial access, then using a different method for defense evasion, and finally targeting specific groups with impersonated documents are all plausible steps in an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.
  - While it is possible that attackers might not follow this exact sequence, the question does not provide enough context to definitively rule out this sequence as implausible.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed likely to be followed by attackers.

**Final Answer: Yes**
