To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Executing itself in the background.
     - Hiding its icon.
     - Restarting when terminated.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the XAgent app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine and send this data via HTTP to its C&C server.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent app is likely to collect geo-location data and send it to its C&C server.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent app is unlikely to collect geo-location data and send it to its C&C server.

3. **Evaluating the Plausibility:**
   - **Executing itself in the background and hiding its icon:** This TTP is common in malware to avoid detection by the user and security software.
   - **Restarting when terminated:** This TTP is also common in malware to ensure persistence and avoid being easily removed.
   - **Collecting geo-location data:** This TTP is plausible for a variety of reasons, including the need for the attacker to know the location of the device for targeted attacks or to track the user's movements.
   - **Sending collected data via HTTP to its C&C server:** This TTP is also common in malware to exfiltrate data and maintain communication with the attacker.

Given that the TTPs described are common in malware and the collection of geo-location data is a plausible and useful piece of information for an attacker, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would include the collection of geo-location data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
