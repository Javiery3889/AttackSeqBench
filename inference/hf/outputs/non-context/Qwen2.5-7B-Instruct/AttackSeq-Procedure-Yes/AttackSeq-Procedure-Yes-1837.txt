Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The callCam app collects extensive information from compromised devices.
   - **Collection Phase:** The data is likely to be encrypted using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The encrypted data is sent to a C&C server using a customized encoding routine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the typical security practices in cyber attacks. Encrypting data using strong encryption algorithms like RSA and AES is a common method to ensure that the data remains secure during transmission. Additionally, using a customized encoding routine can further obfuscate the data, making it more difficult for defenders to intercept and understand the data being exfiltrated.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the callCam app does not use strong encryption methods or customized encoding routines, which is less likely in a sophisticated cyber attack. Without encryption, the data could be easily intercepted and understood by defenders, which would be a significant security risk.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the callCam app is performing actions that are typical of a sophisticated cyber attack. In such scenarios, attackers use strong encryption methods like RSA and AES to protect the data they collect and exfiltrate. The use of a customized encoding routine further enhances the security of the data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the app would indeed encrypt the collected data using RSA and AES before exfiltrating it.

**Final Answer: A**
