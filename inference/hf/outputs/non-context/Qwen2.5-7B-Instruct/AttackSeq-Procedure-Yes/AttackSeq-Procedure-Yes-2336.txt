To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro. This is a common method for initial access.

2. **Execution of VBA Macro**: The VBA macro is designed to execute commands. In this scenario, it is likely to use 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL. 'mshta.exe' is often used to execute HTML applications and can be a stealthy method for downloading and running malicious payloads.

3. **Persistence**: After the dropper is executed, the malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours. This is a common method to ensure the malware remains active and can be triggered at regular intervals.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. The use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL is a plausible method for initial execution and persistence. Creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' at regular intervals is also a common persistence mechanism.

- **B: No** - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. If the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible, then the answer "No" would be incorrect.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed likely.

Final Answer: A
