To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers use OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails.
2. **Reconnaissance**: Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software.

### Answer Choices:
A. Yes
B. No

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access via OLE2 Documents**: OLE2 (Object Linking and Embedding, version 2) documents are known to be a vector for delivering malicious payloads. These documents can contain embedded links that, when opened, can execute malicious code or download additional malware.

2. **Spear Phishing**: Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers craft emails that appear to come from a trusted source, often with personalized content to increase the likelihood of the recipient opening the email and interacting with the embedded links.

3. **Microsoft Word GET Request**: The question mentions that Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software. This is a plausible technique for reconnaissance, where the attackers gather information about the target's environment to tailor their attack more effectively.

4. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described (spear phishing with OLE2 documents containing embedded links, followed by reconnaissance using a GET request) is a common and effective sequence of TTPs used by many threat actors, including those associated with the Freakyshelly group.

### Conclusion:
Given the described sequence of TTPs, it is indeed likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would follow this approach. The use of OLE2 documents for initial access and the subsequent reconnaissance using a GET request are both well-documented techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
