Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attack sequence starts with sending spear phishing emails.
   - These emails contain malicious attachments that exploit CVE-2021-40444.
   - The exploitation of the vulnerability leads to the execution of code on the victim's system.

2. **Evaluate the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control (C2) servers during the resource development phase.

3. **Analyze Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - After gaining initial access through the exploitation of the vulnerability, attackers typically need a way to communicate with the compromised system. Acquiring a domain to serve as a C2 server is a common practice to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not acquire any infrastructure to serve as C2 servers. However, this would be unusual and less likely in a typical attack sequence where maintaining control over the compromised system is crucial.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical behavior of attackers, it is highly likely that they would acquire infrastructure such as domains to serve as C2 servers to maintain control and communication with the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A**
