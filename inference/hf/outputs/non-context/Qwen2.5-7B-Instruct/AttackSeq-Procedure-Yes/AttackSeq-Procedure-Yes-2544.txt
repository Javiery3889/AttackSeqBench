To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the Milestone backdoor will:
     - Discover system information.
     - Capture the screen.
     - Exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that after the backdoor has discovered system information and captured the screen, it will indeed exfiltrate the data over the C2 channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that the backdoor will not exfiltrate the data over the C2 channel after performing the discovery and screen capture actions.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question implies a logical sequence where the backdoor first gathers information (discovery) and then performs an action (screen capture) before the final step of exfiltrating the data.
   - The question does not provide any information that would suggest the backdoor would not proceed to exfiltrate the data after these actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will indeed exfiltrate the data over the C2 channel after the discovery and screen capture.

**Final Answer: A**
