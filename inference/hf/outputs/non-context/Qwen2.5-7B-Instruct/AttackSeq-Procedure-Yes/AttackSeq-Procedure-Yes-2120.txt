To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP: Fileless Implants via DLL Side-Loading using DESLoader**
   - This indicates that the attackers have already managed to inject malicious code into a legitimate process or system without writing to the disk, which is a common technique to evade traditional disk-based detection mechanisms.

2. **Software Discovery using WMIC**
   - WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is a powerful tool that can be used to gather information about the system, including network configurations, installed software, and other system details. This step is often used to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

3. **Lateral Movement using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**
   - RDP is a protocol that allows remote access to a computer. If the attackers have discovered additional targets using WMIC, they might use RDP to move laterally within the network to compromise other systems.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is:
- First, the attackers use DESLoader to deploy fileless implants.
- Then, they use WMIC to discover additional software and systems within the network.
- Finally, they use RDP to move laterally to target additional servers.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It is logical that after deploying fileless implants and discovering the network environment, the attackers would use RDP for lateral movement.

- **B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. It would be unusual to skip the software discovery step and directly use RDP without first understanding the network environment.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
