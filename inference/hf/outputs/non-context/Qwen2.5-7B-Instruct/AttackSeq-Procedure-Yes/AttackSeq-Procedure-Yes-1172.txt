Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a group might use in an attack.
   - The sequence is:
     1. Conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.
     2. Deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
     3. Using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after conducting vulnerability scanning, the group would deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services and then use stolen credentials to maintain persistent access.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - Vulnerability scanning helps identify potential entry points.
       - Deploying public exploits on these vulnerabilities can quickly gain access to the systems.
       - Using stolen credentials is a common method to maintain persistent access, especially after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the group would not follow the described sequence.
     - This is less plausible because the described sequence is a logical and common approach in many cyber-attacks.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a typical and effective approach in many cyber-attacks.
   - Vulnerability scanning helps identify weaknesses.
   - Deploying public exploits on these vulnerabilities can quickly gain access.
   - Using stolen credentials is a standard method to maintain persistent access.
   - Therefore, the described sequence is highly plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
