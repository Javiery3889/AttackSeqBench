To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and the answer choices:

1. **Initial Access Vector (T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise)**: This TTP involves the attackers using a compromised software update to gain initial access to a target network. This is a common method used by attackers to establish a foothold in a network.

2. **Resource Development (T1059 - Resource Development)**: This TTP involves the attackers acquiring and developing infrastructure for their operations. This can include setting up command and control (C2) servers, parking domains, and other infrastructure that will be used for future operations.

3. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers would park domains after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.
   - Domain parking is a method of acquiring infrastructure, which falls under the Resource Development TTP (T1059).

4. **Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This suggests that after gaining initial access through a compromised software update, the attackers would likely park domains as part of their Resource Development efforts.
   - **B: No**: This suggests that the attackers would not park domains after gaining initial access through a compromised software update.

5. **Reasoning**:
   - After gaining initial access, attackers often need to establish a stable and persistent presence in the target environment. Parking domains is a common method to ensure that they have a reliable and controlled infrastructure for command and control.
   - Domain parking can be used to host C2 servers, which are essential for maintaining control over compromised systems and for exfiltrating data.

Given this reasoning, it is highly plausible that attackers would park domains as part of their Resource Development efforts after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.

**Final Answer: A**
