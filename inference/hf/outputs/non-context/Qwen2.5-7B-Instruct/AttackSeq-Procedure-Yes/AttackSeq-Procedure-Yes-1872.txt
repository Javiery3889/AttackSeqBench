To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: FIN13 has exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
2. **Reconnaissance**: The question asks if Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase.
3. **Execution**: The group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that Mandiant would track FIN13 during the Reconnaissance phase.
- It is logical to assume that Mandiant, as a cybersecurity firm, would be tracking the activities of a known threat actor like FIN13 throughout the attack lifecycle, including the Reconnaissance phase.
- The deployment of web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK is a clear indication of reconnaissance activities, as these are typically used to gather information about the target network and systems.

**B: No**
- This choice suggests that Mandiant would not track FIN13 during the Reconnaissance phase.
- This is less likely because the deployment of web shells and custom malware is a strong indicator of reconnaissance activities, and Mandiant would be expected to monitor such activities closely.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Access**: FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware, which are common tools used in the Reconnaissance phase to gather information about the target environment.
2. **Reconnaissance**: The deployment of these tools is a clear sign of reconnaissance activities.
3. **Execution**: After gathering the necessary information, FIN13 would likely proceed to the Execution phase using JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

Given the above analysis, it is highly plausible that Mandiant would track FIN13 during the Reconnaissance phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
