To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and analyze each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Malicious Macro**: Downloads and executes a second-stage downloader.
2. **Second-Stage Downloader**: Fetches and executes an encrypted third-stage payload.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: The question asks if Lokibot is likely to escalate privileges by injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe.
4. **Bypassing UAC**: The question also asks if it employs process hollowing to bypass User Account Control (UAC).

### Answer Choices:
A. Yes
B. No

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Lokibot Behavior**: Lokibot is known for its modular design and ability to perform various actions, including privilege escalation and bypassing security mechanisms.
2. **Injecting Malicious DLL into Notepad.exe**: This is a common technique used by malware to gain persistence and evade detection. Injecting a malicious DLL into a system process like Notepad.exe can help the malware maintain a foothold on the system.
3. **Process Hollowing**: This technique involves replacing the code of a legitimate process with malicious code. It is often used to bypass UAC and other security measures. Process hollowing can be a method to execute malicious code in the context of a legitimate process, which can help evade detection and user interaction prompts.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:
- **Choice A (Yes)**: This choice suggests that Lokibot is likely to perform both actionsâ€”injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe and using process hollowing to bypass UAC. Given Lokibot's known capabilities and the effectiveness of these techniques in evading security measures, this is a plausible sequence of TTPs.
- **Choice B (No)**: This choice suggests that Lokibot is unlikely to perform these actions. However, given the effectiveness and commonality of these techniques in malware operations, this seems less plausible.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with Choice A, as it reflects the known capabilities and behavior of Lokibot.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
