Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The question mentions the use of the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` for privilege escalation.
   - **Command and Control (C&C) Communication:** The shellcode is expected to contact a C&C server at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ`.
   - **Domain Resolution:** The domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` is expected to resolve to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91`.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice assumes that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and likely to occur.
     - The use of a Metasploit module for privilege escalation is a common technique.
     - The C&C communication and domain resolution to the same IP address are also plausible, as it could be a technique to avoid detection by making the C&C communication appear legitimate.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is unlikely or implausible.
     - While it is possible that the domain and IP address could be different, the question does not provide any information that would make this sequence implausible.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible and common technique used in cyber attacks, the most likely answer is that the sequence is indeed plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
