Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The malware (Longhorn) is configured to use a specific domain and IP address for C&C (Command and Control) communication over HTTPS.
   - The communication uses a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - The malware is scheduled for exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

2. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration.
     - Given the context, it makes sense that the malware would use scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection, especially if it is using a custom protocol and HTTPS for C&C communication.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration.
     - This seems less plausible given the context of the question, as the malware is specifically configured for C&C communication and exfiltration.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the malware is set up for C&C communication and exfiltration, and the exfiltration is scheduled to avoid detection.
   - The use of a custom protocol and HTTPS for C&C communication indicates a sophisticated approach, which is often associated with malware that aims to remain undetected.
   - Scheduled exfiltration is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection by upload limits and to blend in with normal traffic.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the malware communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A**
