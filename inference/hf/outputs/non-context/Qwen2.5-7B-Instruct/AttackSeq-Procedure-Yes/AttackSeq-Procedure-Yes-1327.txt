To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **Collection Phase**: The question mentions that CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information. This is a common tactic used by many malware families to gather sensitive data.

2. **Exfiltration Phase**: The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites. This is a specific exfiltration method that involves using FTP for data transfer and leveraging stored credentials for authentication.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke indeed uses FTP to upload the collected data and contacts live remote sites. This is a plausible scenario as many malware families use FTP for exfiltration due to its simplicity and availability. Additionally, using stored login credentials for FTP is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure the data is transferred without user interaction.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke does not use FTP for exfiltration or does not contact live remote sites. However, without additional context or evidence, this is less likely to be the case, as FTP is a well-known and effective method for data exfiltration.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
