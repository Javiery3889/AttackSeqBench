To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Execution**: The question mentions that a renamed malicious executable "mic.exe" is launched. This is a common TTP where malware is disguised to avoid detection.

2. **Defense Evasion**: The "mic.exe" decodes shellcode from "mic.doc" using custom XOR operations. This is a method to evade signature-based detection by altering the binary signature of the malware.

3. **Configuration Decoding**: The question then states that the "mic.ver" config file is consistently decoded. This suggests that the malware uses this file to obtain configuration details, which could include C&C server addresses, commands, or other necessary information for the malware to function.

4. **Command and Control (C&C) Communication**: The question asks if it is likely that the GroundPeony campaign will establish C&C communication through the consistent decoding of the "mic.ver" config file. Given that the "mic.ver" file contains configuration details, it is plausible that this file could include C&C server information, which the malware would then use to establish communication.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the attack sequence described. The "mic.ver" file, being a configuration file, could indeed contain C&C server information, which the malware would use to establish communication.
- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the plausible scenario where the "mic.ver" file could contain C&C server information.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the GroundPeony campaign would use the "mic.ver" config file to establish C&C communication.

Final Answer: A
