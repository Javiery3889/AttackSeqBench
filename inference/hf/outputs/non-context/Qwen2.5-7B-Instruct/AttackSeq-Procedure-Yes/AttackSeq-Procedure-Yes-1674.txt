Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural steps) used by attackers.
   - The first TTP mentioned is the use of the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise.
   - The second TTP mentioned is the use of the `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView for remote system discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SocGholish Framework:** SocGholish is a framework used for social engineering attacks, often involving phishing emails or websites. It is designed to deliver malware or other malicious content to the victim.
   - **Compromised Legitimate Websites:** This is a common method for initial compromise, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate websites to deliver malware to unsuspecting users.
   - **Get-NetComputer Command from PowerView:** PowerView is a PowerShell module that provides a set of tools for performing reconnaissance and gathering information from a network. The `Get-NetComputer` command is used to discover and enumerate network computers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The SocGholish framework and compromised legitimate websites are often used in the initial stages of an attack to deliver malware or other malicious content to the victim.
   - Once the victim is compromised, the attackers typically use tools like PowerView to perform reconnaissance and gather information about the network, including discovering remote systems.
   - The sequence described in the question (using SocGholish for initial compromise and then using PowerView for remote system discovery) is a plausible and common sequence of TTPs in an attack lifecycle.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is a plausible and common sequence of TTPs.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: A: Yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
