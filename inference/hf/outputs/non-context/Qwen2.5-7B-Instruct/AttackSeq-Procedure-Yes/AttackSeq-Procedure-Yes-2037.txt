Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural) used by the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The malware uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with its C2 server and sends localization data and keyboard layout information.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server as part of its exfiltration process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server.
     - Given that the malware is already communicating with the C2 server and sending specific data (localization and keyboard layout), it is plausible that it could also function as a network sniffer to gather additional information and send it to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server.
     - While it is possible that the malware does not perform this additional function, the question does not provide enough context to definitively rule out this behavior.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes the malware's current behavior, which includes communication with the C2 server and sending specific data.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server.
   - Given that the malware is already communicating with the C2 server and sending specific data, it is reasonable to assume that it could also function as a network sniffer to gather additional information and send it to the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware is likely to function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A**
