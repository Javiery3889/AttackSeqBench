Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys.
   - The malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - The malware is likely to query the registry and identify victim machines as part of its discovery process.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the described TTPs. After achieving persistence and evading detection, the next logical step for the malware would be to gather information about the victim's environment, which includes querying the registry to identify the machine as part of its target.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the described TTPs. If the malware has already achieved persistence and evaded detection, it would be highly unlikely that it would skip the step of identifying the victim machine through registry queries.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already established persistence, which means it can survive reboots and continue to operate.
   - Impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable helps the malware evade detection by security software.
   - The next logical step in the malware's lifecycle would be to gather information about the victim's environment to ensure it is in the correct target environment.
   - Querying the registry is a common method for malware to gather information about the system, including identifying the machine as part of its target.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed query the registry and identify victim machines as part of its discovery process.

Final Answer: A
