To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - Gamaredon uses Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement.
   - Emails with malicious attachments are sent to other targets.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - Gamaredon is known for its targeted attacks and the use of sophisticated techniques to gather intelligence. Deploying scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns to collect valuable information from the compromised systems.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that after using VBA macros for lateral movement, Gamaredon would not deploy scripts to scan for sensitive documents. However, this does not align with the typical behavior of APT groups, which often aim to gather as much information as possible from their targets.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Gamaredon's use of Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement indicates a sophisticated and targeted approach.
   - The next step in an APT campaign is often to gather as much information as possible from the compromised network.
   - Deploying scripts to scan for sensitive documents is a logical and effective method to achieve this goal.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Gamaredon would indeed deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

Final Answer: A
