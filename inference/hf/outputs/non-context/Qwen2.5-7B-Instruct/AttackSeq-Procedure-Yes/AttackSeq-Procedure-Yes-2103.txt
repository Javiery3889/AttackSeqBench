Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves the use of anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques in the Defense Evasion phase.
   - After these techniques, the loader is expected to perform actions in the Discovery phase.
   - The loader is then expected to collect detailed victim system data and activity through a backdoor.

2. **Analyzing the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The use of anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques is a common tactic to evade detection by security tools.
   - **Discovery:** This phase involves gathering information about the victim's environment to understand the target and tailor the attack.
   - **Gathering Victim System Data and Activity:** This is a step that typically follows the discovery phase, where the attacker collects detailed information about the victim's system and activities.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that after using anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques, the loader will gather information about the victim's computer in the Discovery phase, and then collect detailed victim system data and activity through a backdoor.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that the loader will not follow the described sequence of actions.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows the typical order of operations in an attack lifecycle. After evading detection, the attacker would likely gather information about the target environment (Discovery phase) before collecting detailed data (Gathering Victim System Data and Activity).
   - The use of a backdoor is a common method to maintain persistent access and gather detailed information over time, which aligns with the described sequence.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression of attack tactics.

Final Answer: A
