Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural steps) used by malware.
   - The first TTP mentioned is creating a scheduled task with appropriate privileges to ensure persistence.
   - The second TTP is the use of InstallUtil.exe to evade detection by bypassing Smartscreen and AppLocker during its execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Creating a scheduled task with appropriate privileges is a common method for ensuring persistence.
     - InstallUtil.exe is a tool used to install .NET assemblies. It can be used to bypass certain security measures like Smartscreen and AppLocker by installing the malware as a Windows service or executable.
     - This method can indeed help evade detection by security software that relies on these mechanisms.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that using InstallUtil.exe for this purpose is not a plausible method to evade detection.
     - However, the use of InstallUtil.exe to install malware as a service or executable is a known technique to bypass security measures.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The creation of a scheduled task with appropriate privileges is a standard method for ensuring persistence.
   - InstallUtil.exe can be used to install malware as a Windows service or executable, which can help bypass security measures like Smartscreen and AppLocker.
   - This method is a plausible technique for malware to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A**
