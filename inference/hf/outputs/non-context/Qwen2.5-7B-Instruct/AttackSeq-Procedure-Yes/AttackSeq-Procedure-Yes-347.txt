Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have demonstrated reconnaissance capabilities by understanding the SolarWinds source code and internal development domain names.
   - They have developed malware capabilities as part of their Resource Development efforts.
   - They achieved Initial Access through a compromised software update.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. The attackers first conducted reconnaissance, then developed malware, and finally achieved Initial Access through a compromised software update.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. If the attackers did not develop malware capabilities, they would not have been able to achieve Initial Access through a compromised software update.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attackers first conducted reconnaissance, then developed malware, and finally achieved Initial Access.
   - The development of malware is a critical step in the attack sequence, as it is used to achieve Initial Access.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers did indeed develop malware capabilities as part of their Resource Development efforts.

**Final Answer: A**
