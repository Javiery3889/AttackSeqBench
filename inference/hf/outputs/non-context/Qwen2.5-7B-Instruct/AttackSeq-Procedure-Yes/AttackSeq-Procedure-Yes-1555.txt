Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Internal reconnaissance: Accessing user’s contacts and extracting system and network information.
   - Lateral movement: Using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.
   - Spear-phishing: Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets leveraging the victim’s trusted relationships.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. APT42 is known for using reconnaissance to gather information, then moving laterally to gain access to corporate accounts, and finally using spear-phishing to exploit the trust within the organization.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. It would imply that APT42 does not follow this specific sequence, which contradicts known APT42 behavior.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and typical sequence of TTPs for APT42, as it follows a common APT lifecycle of reconnaissance, lateral movement, and exploitation.

Final Answer: Yes
