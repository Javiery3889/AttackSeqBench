Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     1. Creating a LNK file in the system startup folder.
     2. Executing `rundll32.exe` to run a malicious payload from a `.DAT` file.
     3. The payload is likely to connect to a hardcoded C&C server.
     4. The connection is made via an HTTP POST request.
     5. The request contains BASE64-encoded victim information.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the BlackEnergy Trojan will indeed perform the described actions.
     - BlackEnergy is known for its persistence mechanisms and C&C communication. The described TTPs align with typical BlackEnergy behavior:
       - Persistence through startup folder LNK files is a common technique.
       - Executing a payload from a `.DAT` file is a known method used by BlackEnergy.
       - Connecting to a hardcoded C&C server and sending victim information via HTTP POST is also consistent with BlackEnergy's known TTPs.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the BlackEnergy Trojan will not perform the described actions.
     - Given the known TTPs of BlackEnergy, this choice does not align with the typical behavior of the malware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the known behavior of the BlackEnergy Trojan.

Final Answer: A
