Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by TDrop2 malware.
   - The first TTP mentioned is "discovery activities to collect system and network information."
   - The second TTP is the communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
   - The third TTP involves the use of a custom base64 alphabet.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware performs the described sequence of actions.
     - TDrop2 is known for its use of base64 encoding for command and control communications, which aligns with the second TTP.
     - The use of a custom base64 alphabet is also a plausible technique to evade detection, which aligns with the third TTP.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware does not perform the described sequence of actions.
     - Given the known behavior of TDrop2, this does not align with the typical TTPs associated with the malware.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - TDrop2 is known to use base64 encoding for its C2 communications, which matches the second TTP.
   - The use of a custom base64 alphabet is a plausible technique to evade detection, which aligns with the third TTP.
   - The first TTP, discovery activities, is a common initial step in many malware operations, including TDrop2.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is supported by the known behavior of TDrop2 malware.

**Final Answer: A**
