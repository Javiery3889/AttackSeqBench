To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the answer choices.

1. **FireEye Observation**: The question mentions that FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDoS C2 (Command and Control) servers. This indicates that the attackers were using encryption to secure their communication with the C2 servers, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.

2. **Targeting Websites**: The question states that the attackers launched DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong. This suggests that the attackers had a specific target set, likely related to political motivations.

3. **Impact on Next Media**: The question also mentions that the Next Media network suffered a 'total failure' due to these DDoS attacks. This indicates a significant impact on the targeted network.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described. The use of encryption (XOR keys) to secure C2 communications, targeting specific websites (promoting democracy in Hong Kong), and causing a significant impact (Next Media's network failure) are all plausible steps in a well-coordinated DDoS attack campaign.

- **B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs described. If the attackers did not launch DDoS attacks against the specified targets and did not cause the significant impact on Next Media, then the sequence of TTPs would not match the scenario described.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best answered by "Yes."

Final Answer: A
