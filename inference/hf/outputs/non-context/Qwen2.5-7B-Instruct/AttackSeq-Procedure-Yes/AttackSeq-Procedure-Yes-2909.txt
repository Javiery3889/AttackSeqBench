Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where malicious code is executed using the AtomBombing technique. This technique involves manipulating atom tables to execute arbitrary code. The question then asks if it is likely that threat actors will use this capability to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - AtomBombing is a technique that can be used to execute arbitrary code. By exploiting atom tables, threat actors can gain control over the execution flow. Injecting code into trusted processes is a common tactic to evade detection and maintain persistence. Trusted processes are less likely to be monitored or flagged by security products, making them an attractive target for threat actors.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that threat actors would not use AtomBombing to inject code into trusted processes. However, given the nature of AtomBombing and the goal of evading security measures, this seems less plausible.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  1. AtomBombing is a technique that allows for the execution of arbitrary code by manipulating atom tables.
  2. The primary goal of threat actors is often to maintain persistence and evade detection.
  3. Injecting code into trusted processes is a well-known method to achieve these goals, as these processes are less likely to be monitored or flagged by security products.
  4. Therefore, it is highly likely that threat actors would use AtomBombing to inject code into trusted processes to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products.

- **Final Answer: Yes**
