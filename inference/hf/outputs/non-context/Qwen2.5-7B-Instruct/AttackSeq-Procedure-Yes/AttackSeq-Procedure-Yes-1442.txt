Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Exploiting a Vulnerability**: The question mentions exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) via email attachments. This is a common initial attack vector for malware.

2. **Dropping Taidoor Malware**: The Taidoor malware is dropped as part of the attack. This is a typical behavior for malware to establish persistence and further compromise the system.

3. **Opening a Decoy Document**: The decoy document is opened to maintain the appearance of legitimacy and to ensure the user interacts with the system, which is a social engineering tactic.

4. **Communicating with CnC Servers**: The malware is expected to communicate with its Command and Control (CnC) servers (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw). This is a standard behavior for malware to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

5. **Avoiding Common Network Detection Signatures**: The question asks if Taidoor is likely to evolve to avoid common network detection signatures. This is a plausible behavior for malware to evade security measures.

6. **Modified Traffic Pattern**: The malware is expected to use a modified traffic pattern to communicate with its CnC servers. This is a common tactic to avoid detection by network security systems.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the typical behavior of malware to evolve and use sophisticated techniques to avoid detection. Modifying traffic patterns and avoiding common signatures are common strategies used by malware to evade security measures.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Taidoor would not evolve to avoid common network detection signatures or use a modified traffic pattern. This is less likely given the sophistication of modern malware.

**Final Answer: Yes**
