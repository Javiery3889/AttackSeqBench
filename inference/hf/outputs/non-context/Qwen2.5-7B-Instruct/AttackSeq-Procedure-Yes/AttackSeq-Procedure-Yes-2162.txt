Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access Phase**: APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email. This is a common method used by APTs to gain initial access to a network.

2. **Command and Control (C2) Detection**: After gaining access, the next phase would be to establish a C2 channel to exfiltrate data or issue further commands. The question mentions that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst detected the C2 activity.

3. **Automated Investigation**: Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is known for its ability to automate the investigation process, which includes analyzing network traffic, identifying anomalies, and correlating events to understand the scope of the intrusion.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after detecting C2 activity, Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst would indeed automate the investigation process. This is plausible because Darktrace is designed to handle such scenarios by automatically analyzing the infected device and the network to understand the extent of the breach.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst would not automate the investigation process. This is less plausible because the primary function of such AI-driven security tools is to automate and expedite the investigation process.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. APT35 used a spear phishing email to gain initial access.
2. C2 detection is a critical step in understanding the scope of the breach.
3. Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is known for its automated investigation capabilities.
4. It is logical and expected for such a tool to automatically investigate after detecting C2 activity.

**Final Answer: Yes**
