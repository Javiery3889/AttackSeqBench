Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware (KONNI) establishes communication with C2 domains using HTTP connections hosted by a free web hosting provider.
   - The malware steals files from the local system.
   - The stolen data (such as keystrokes and screenshots) is uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after establishing communication, the malware will indeed steal files and then upload the stolen data to the C2 infrastructure.
     - KONNI is known to perform data exfiltration, which includes stealing files, keystrokes, and screenshots. This aligns with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not steal files and will not upload stolen data to the C2 infrastructure after establishing communication.
     - This does not align with the known behavior of KONNI malware, which is designed to exfiltrate data.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the known behavior of KONNI malware, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with the malware's known activities.

**Final Answer: A**
