Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The question mentions that TeamTNT performs reconnaissance by scanning for open Docker API endpoints. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, as it helps the attacker identify potential entry points.

2. **Killing Competitor Images**: The next step is killing competitor images using `docker rm` commands. This action could be part of a broader strategy to disrupt the victim's operations or to clear the environment for their own use.

3. **Exploiting Weave Scope Service**: The question then asks if TeamTNT is likely to gain initial access by exploiting an exposed Weave Scope service. Weave Scope is a network visualization and management tool for Docker environments. If it is exposed and not properly secured, it can be a vector for gaining access.

4. **Downloading and Executing a Coin Miner**: The final step is downloading a coin miner as `/usr/sbin/docker-update` and running it for cryptocurrency mining. This is a common tactic used by threat actors to leverage the victim's resources for their own financial gain.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible. It aligns with a typical attack sequence where reconnaissance is followed by gaining access, and then using the compromised environment for malicious purposes.
  
- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible. However, the steps described are logical and consistent with known attack patterns.

Given the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
