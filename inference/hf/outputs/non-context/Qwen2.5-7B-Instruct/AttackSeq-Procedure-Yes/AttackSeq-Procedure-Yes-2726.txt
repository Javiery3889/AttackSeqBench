Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - Execution of the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.
   - Discovery activities such as system and network connections discovery.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible. Spear-phishing is a common method for gaining initial access, and running a backdoor in memory can help maintain persistence and avoid detection. Discovery activities are a logical next step to understand the network and systems.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible. However, the described sequence aligns with typical cyber-attack methodologies, especially for advanced threat actors like Lazarus.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Spear-phishing is a well-documented method used by Lazarus and other APT groups to gain initial access to a network.
   - Executing a backdoor in memory is a common technique to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software and to maintain persistence.
   - Discovery activities are a standard step in the attack lifecycle to understand the network and identify valuable targets.

Given the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described is plausible and aligns with Lazarus's known tactics.

**Final Answer: A**
