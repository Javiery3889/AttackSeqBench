Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack starts with "initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document." This is a common initial attack vector where attackers use social engineering to deliver malware.

2. **Encoded PowerShell Script**: The question then states that "an encoded PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, will execute." This is a plausible next step. After gaining initial access, attackers often use obfuscated scripts to evade detection and execute their payload.

3. **Download of Malware**: The question concludes by mentioning that "subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware." Both Ursnif and GandCrab are known to be distributed via similar methods, where initial access leads to the execution of a script that then downloads additional malware.

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural steps) described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs.
- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
