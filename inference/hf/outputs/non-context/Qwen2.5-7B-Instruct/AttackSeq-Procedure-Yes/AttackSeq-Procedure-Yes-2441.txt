To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Elise Malware Collection Phase**:
   - The malware collects system information such as IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration. This is a common initial phase in many malware operations, often referred to as "discovery" or "reconnaissance."

2. **Communication with C2 Server**:
   - The malware is likely to communicate with a hardcoded C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14. This indicates that the malware has a predefined command and control (C2) infrastructure to which it will send collected data and possibly receive further instructions.

3. **Application Layer Protocol**:
   - The question specifically asks if the communication with the C2 server is likely to use an application layer protocol. Application layer protocols are commonly used for C2 communications because they can be more easily obfuscated and can leverage existing network protocols, making detection more difficult.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the typical behavior of malware, which often uses application layer protocols for C2 communications to avoid detection by network security measures.

- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the malware uses a lower-level protocol (e.g., raw sockets, raw IP packets) for C2 communications, which is less common and more likely to be detected by network security systems.

Based on the typical behavior of malware and the need for stealth in C2 communications, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware communicates with the C2 server using an application layer protocol.

**Final Answer: A**
