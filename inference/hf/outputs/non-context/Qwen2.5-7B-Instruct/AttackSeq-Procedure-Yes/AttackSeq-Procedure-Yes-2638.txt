Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Machete's Actions:** The malware (Machete) has performed several actions: stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes. These are typical data collection methods used by malware to gather sensitive information.
   - **Communication Methods:** The question asks if it is likely that the malware used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C2) servers.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** After the data collection, the malware is supposed to exfiltrate the encrypted data to remote servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) are common protocols used for data transfer over the internet. They are relatively easy to implement and can be used for both data collection and exfiltration.
     - Using these protocols for communication with C2 servers is a plausible method, especially if the malware needs to send collected data to a remote server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the malware did not use FTP and HTTP ports for communication, which is less likely given the commonality and ease of use of these protocols for data transfer.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware has collected sensitive data through various means (stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes).
   - It is reasonable to assume that the malware would use common and easily accessible protocols like FTP and HTTP to communicate with its C2 servers and exfiltrate the data.
   - The use of these protocols is a standard practice in malware operations due to their widespread availability and ease of implementation.

**Final Answer: A**
