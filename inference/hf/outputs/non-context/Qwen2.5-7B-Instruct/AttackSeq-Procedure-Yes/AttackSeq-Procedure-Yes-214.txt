Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Elirks malware retrieves its C2 server address.
   - The method described involves accessing microblog services or social networking sites.
   - Attackers create accounts on these platforms to post encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described method is plausible.
     - It aligns with known tactics where malware can use social media or microblogging services to retrieve encoded C2 addresses.
     - This method is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection and maintain communication with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described method is not plausible.
     - However, there is no information provided in the question that directly contradicts this method.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a plausible method for malware to retrieve C2 addresses by using social media or microblogging services.
   - This method is consistent with known malware tactics and has been observed in various cyber-attacks.
   - There is no evidence provided in the question that would make this method implausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed likely to be correct.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Final Answer: A
