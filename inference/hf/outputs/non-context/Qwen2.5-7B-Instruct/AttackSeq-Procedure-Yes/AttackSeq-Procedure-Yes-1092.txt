To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Malicious code execution using system utilities.
   - Deployment of the CommsCacher backdoor.
   - Escalation of privileges by manipulating system processes and services.

2. **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Yes**
   - **Malicious code execution using system utilities:** The Lazarus Group is known to use various methods to execute malicious code, and system utilities can be a common vector for such activities. They often leverage legitimate tools to hide their malicious activities.
   - **Deployment of the CommsCacher backdoor:** CommsCacher is a known backdoor used by the Lazarus Group to maintain persistence and communicate with their command and control servers. This aligns with the group's tactics.
   - **Escalation of privileges by manipulating system processes and services:** The Lazarus Group is known for its sophisticated methods of privilege escalation, often involving the manipulation of system processes and services to gain deeper access to the target system.

3. **Evaluate Answer Choice B: No**
   - This choice would imply that the Lazarus Group did not follow the described sequence of TTPs, which contradicts the known tactics and techniques of the group.

Given the analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns with the known tactics of the Lazarus Group.

**Final Answer: Yes**
