To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing**: The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing links to Adobe Flash files (`rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf` and `report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf`).

2. **Execution of Flash Exploit**: The Flash files are exploited to gain initial access. This exploit is likely to execute malicious code to establish a foothold on the target system.

3. **Execution of Shellcode**: The question suggests that the Flash exploit (`show.swf`) will execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes. This is a plausible step as Flash exploits often use embedded ActionScript to execute malicious code.

4. **Evading Defenses**: After gaining initial access, the attacker might attempt to evade detection by using a payload that is less likely to be flagged by security systems. The question mentions that the payload is embedded in an animated GIF image (`b.gif`).

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It is plausible that the Flash exploit would execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes and then use an animated GIF to embed the payload, which is a common technique to evade detection.

- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. If the Flash exploit did not execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes and did not use an animated GIF to embed the payload, it would not align with the described attack sequence.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
