Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Powersing** is a TTP (Technical, Procedural, or Operational Technique, Trick, or Tool) that captures periodic screenshots and executes arbitrary PowerShell scripts provided by the C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - The question asks if Powersing is likely to leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Leveraging public services and dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic is a common tactic used by adversaries to avoid detection. Dead drop resolvers are often used to store data in a way that it appears to be part of normal traffic, making it harder for defenders to identify and block.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that Powersing does not use public services or dead drop resolvers, which is less likely given the nature of the TTPs described (screenshot capturing and PowerShell script execution).

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sophisticated TTP involving the use of PowerShell scripts and periodic screenshots, which are often used to gather intelligence and exfiltrate data.
   - To avoid detection, adversaries typically use techniques like dead drop resolvers and public services to store and exfiltrate data in a manner that blends in with legitimate traffic.
   - Therefore, it is highly plausible that Powersing would leverage these techniques to store data and communicate with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A**
