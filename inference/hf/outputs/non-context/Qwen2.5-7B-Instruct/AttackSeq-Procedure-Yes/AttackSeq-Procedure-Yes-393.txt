To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The backdoor has already obtained local IP address and system time through discovery.
   - The backdoor is likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media.
   - The backdoor will notify the C&C server about these files.
   - The backdoor will compress the collected files.
   - The backdoor will send the compressed files to the C&C server.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It confirms that the backdoor will indeed collect files from removable media, notify the C&C server, compress the files, and then send them to the C&C server.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that the backdoor will not perform the actions of collecting files, notifying the C&C server, compressing the files, and sending them to the C&C server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the backdoor will perform a series of actions: collecting files, notifying the C&C server, compressing the files, and sending them to the C&C server.
   - Answer choice A directly confirms these actions, making it the most plausible sequence of TTPs.
   - Answer choice B contradicts the sequence of actions described in the question, making it the least plausible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is confirmed by answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
