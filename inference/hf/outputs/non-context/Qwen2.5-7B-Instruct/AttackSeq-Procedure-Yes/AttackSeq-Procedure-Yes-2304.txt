Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **PsLogList:** This tool is used for account discovery by exporting Windows Security Event Logs.
   - **Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz:** This is used to dump credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The question asks if the adversary will move laterally to a domain controller using SMB, PsExec, or WinRM.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - **PsLogList** is used to gather information about accounts, which is a reconnaissance step.
     - **Mimikatz** is used to extract credentials, which is a privilege escalation step.
     - **Lateral Movement** to a domain controller using SMB, PsExec, or WinRM is a common next step after gaining credentials, as it allows the adversary to spread within the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the adversary does not move laterally to a domain controller, which is less likely given the context of having credentials and the need to spread within the network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described (account discovery, credential dumping, and then lateral movement) is a typical sequence in an advanced persistent threat (APT) scenario.
   - Moving to a domain controller is a strategic step to gain more control over the network and to spread further.

**Final Answer: Yes**
