To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Worm Deployment**: The attackers deploy worms to scan for misconfigured hosts and exploit exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
2. **Exploitation of Docker API**: Once initial access is gained, the attackers use the Docker API to further their attack.
3. **Command Interpreter Abuse**: The attackers then use command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
4. **Resource Hijacking**: The ultimate objective is to achieve resource hijacking through malicious container images.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- **Worm Deployment and Exploitation**: This part of the sequence is plausible and aligns with the initial steps of an attack where attackers use automated tools to find and exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Command Interpreter Abuse**: Command interpreters are commonly used to execute scripts and commands on a compromised system. Executing cryptocurrency mining scripts through a command interpreter is a common tactic to quickly monetize the compromised system.
- **Resource Hijacking**: Using malicious container images to hijack resources is a sophisticated and plausible final step, as it allows attackers to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

**B: No**
- This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs described is not plausible. However, each step in the sequence (worm deployment, exploitation of Docker API, command interpreter abuse, and resource hijacking) is a logical and commonly observed tactic in cyber attacks.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Worm Deployment**: Worms are often used to spread and exploit vulnerabilities, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
2. **Exploitation of Docker API**: Once initial access is gained, attackers often use the Docker API to further their attack, as it provides a powerful and flexible way to manage containers and their configurations.
3. **Command Interpreter Abuse**: Using a command interpreter to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts is a straightforward and effective way to quickly monetize the compromised system.
4. **Resource Hijacking**: Finally, using malicious container images to hijack resources is a sophisticated and plausible method to maintain control and persistence on the compromised system.

### Conclusion:
Given the logical progression and commonality of each step in the sequence, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
