Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already employed a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts. The next step in the sequence is to determine if the attacker, specifically Rocket Kitten, is likely to establish communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server to download malware or monitor the victim's communications.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Rocket Kitten, as a known threat actor, is known for its sophisticated cyber-espionage activities. Establishing communication with a C&C server is a common and expected behavior for such actors to maintain control over their operations, download additional malware, or monitor the victim's communications.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the typical behavior of a threat actor like Rocket Kitten. It would be unusual for them to forgo establishing a C&C server communication, especially after gaining access to additional accounts and sensitive information.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Rocket Kitten is a known threat actor that engages in sophisticated cyber-espionage activities.
- The keylogger has already provided the attacker with access to additional accounts, which is a valuable asset for further exploitation.
- Establishing a C&C server communication is a standard practice for threat actors to maintain control, download additional tools, and monitor the victim's activities.
- Given the nature of Rocket Kitten's operations and the typical behavior of threat actors in similar scenarios, it is highly likely that they would establish such communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
