To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and typical cyber attack sequences.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack started with compromising SolarWinds and delivering the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack. This is a well-documented method of initial access.

2. **Communication with C2 Server**: The next step in the attack sequence would be for the backdoor to communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server. This is a standard TTP to further exploit the compromised system and gather intelligence or exfiltrate data.

3. **Protocol for Further Exploitation**: Once the backdoor is communicating with the C2 server, it is highly likely that the attackers would use a protocol to facilitate further exploitation. This could include protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, or even more covert methods like custom protocols or obfuscated communication channels.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the Sunburst backdoor communicating with its C2 server using a protocol to further exploit the compromised system.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes** - This aligns with the typical behavior of backdoors and the need for communication with a C2 server to carry out further actions.
- **B: No** - This would imply that the backdoor does not communicate with a C2 server, which is not consistent with the standard operation of such malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
