To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Running in memory:** This is a technique to evade traditional antivirus and endpoint detection systems.
   - **Multi-beacon communication:** This refers to the use of multiple communication intervals to evade network monitoring and detection.
   - **PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts:** PowerShell is often used by attackers for its flexibility and ability to execute commands without writing to disk, which can help evade detection.
   - **HTTP GET requests for C2 communication:** This is a common method for APTs to communicate with their command and control servers, as it is less likely to be detected by network security measures.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - APT-TOCS is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection. Running in memory and multi-beacon communication are consistent with their tactics. Using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts is plausible because PowerShell can be used to execute malicious code without leaving traces on the disk, and it can be used to download and execute scripts. Communicating via HTTP GET requests is also a common method for APTs to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice would imply that APT-TOCS does not use these specific techniques, which contradicts the known behavior of APT-TOCS and other sophisticated APTs.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT-TOCS is known for using advanced evasion techniques.
   - Running in memory and multi-beacon communication are consistent with their tactics.
   - PowerShell is a common tool for executing malicious code without leaving traces, and it can be used to download and execute encrypted scripts.
   - HTTP GET requests are a common method for APTs to communicate with their command and control servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
