To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Aria-body Backdoor**: This is a specific malware that collects detailed information from the victim's machine. This is the initial step in the attack sequence.

2. **HTTP and TCP Protocols for C&C Communication**: These are common communication methods used by APT groups for Command and Control (C&C) communications. HTTP is often used because it is a standard protocol that blends in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect. TCP is a reliable protocol for establishing and maintaining a connection, which is essential for C&C communications.

3. **Executing Additional Commands**: After establishing communication, the APT group would likely send additional commands to the compromised machine to further exploit the system or exfiltrate data.

Given the context of the Naikon APT group, which is known for its sophisticated and stealthy methods, it is highly plausible that they would use common yet effective communication protocols like HTTP and TCP for C&C communication. This approach helps in evading detection by security systems that may not be configured to look for malicious activities over these standard protocols.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The Aria-body backdoor is used to gather information.
- The Naikon APT group is known for using standard protocols for C&C communication to avoid detection.
- HTTP and TCP are common and effective protocols for such communications.
- After establishing communication, the group would likely send additional commands to the compromised machine.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
