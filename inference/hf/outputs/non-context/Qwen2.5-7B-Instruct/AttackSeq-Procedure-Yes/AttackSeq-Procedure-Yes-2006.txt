Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural steps) that are part of an attack lifecycle.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Reconnaissance: Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods.
     - Malware Installation: Using employee-enabled macro execution to install malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3.
     - Communication Establishment: The malware is expected to establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the typical behavior of malware like BlackEnergy 3. After installation, such malware often establishes a connection with its C2 servers to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the typical behavior of BlackEnergy 3 or similar malware. Establishing communication with C2 servers is a standard and critical step for these types of malware to function effectively.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Step 1: The question describes a sequence of TTPs that are part of an attack lifecycle, starting with reconnaissance and leading to the installation of malware.
   - Step 2: BlackEnergy 3, as a known malware, is designed to perform actions after installation, such as establishing a connection with its C2 servers.
   - Step 3: The question specifically mentions that the malware is installed through employee-enabled macro execution, which is a common vector for such attacks.
   - Step 4: Given the typical behavior of BlackEnergy 3 and similar malware, it is highly likely that the malware will establish communication with its C2 servers after installation.

**Final Answer: A**
