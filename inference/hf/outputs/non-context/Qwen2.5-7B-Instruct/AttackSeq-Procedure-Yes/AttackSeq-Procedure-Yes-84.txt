Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Malware decrypts and saves the spying library to the user's temporary folder.
   - The spying library is loaded as a library.
   - Malicious code is injected into explorer.exe.

2. **Evaluate the Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to ensure persistence by copying itself into the System32 directory and creating services initiated at system startup.

3. **Analyze Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that the malware is likely to use these methods to ensure persistence.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that the malware is unlikely to use these methods to ensure persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Copying itself into the System32 directory is a common method for malware to ensure persistence because System32 is a critical directory where legitimate system files reside. Malware in this directory can be executed every time the system starts.
   - Creating services initiated at system startup is another common persistence mechanism. Services can be configured to start automatically with the system, ensuring the malware runs every time the system boots.

Given that both methods (copying into System32 and creating services) are well-known and effective persistence mechanisms used by malware, it is highly plausible that the malware in question would employ these tactics.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
