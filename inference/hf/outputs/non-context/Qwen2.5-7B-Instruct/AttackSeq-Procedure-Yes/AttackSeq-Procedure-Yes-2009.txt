Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The adversaries deliver phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments, and employees enable macros to install BlackEnergy 3 malware. This is a common initial access technique used by APTs.

2. **Malware Installation**: BlackEnergy 3 is known for its capabilities in establishing a foothold on the network and conducting various malicious activities. It is designed to perform reconnaissance and exfiltrate data, among other functions.

3. **C2 Connection**: Establishing a connection to a C2 server is a typical next step for malware to receive further instructions, updates, and to exfiltrate data. BlackEnergy 3 is known for its C2 communication capabilities.

4. **Internal Network Reconnaissance**: Once the malware is installed and a C2 connection is established, it is logical for the malware to perform reconnaissance to understand the network topology and identify valuable targets.

5. **Credential Harvesting**: After reconnaissance, the malware often attempts to gather credentials to move laterally within the network or to gain access to sensitive systems.

Given this sequence of events, it is highly plausible that the malware would follow this sequence of actions.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes** - This aligns with the typical behavior of BlackEnergy 3 and the logical sequence of actions after initial access.
- **B: No** - This would imply that the malware does not perform these actions, which contradicts the known behavior of BlackEnergy 3.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
