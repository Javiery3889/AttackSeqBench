To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTPs Mentioned:**
   - Taidoor malware uses a downloader.
   - The downloader decrypts a modified version of the malware.

2. **Question Context:**
   - The question asks if the new Taidoor variant is likely to communicate with the command-and-control (C2) servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw after the initial TTPs.

3. **Answer Choices:**
   - A: Yes
   - B: No

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of a downloader and decryption of a modified version of the malware are typical TTPs used by malware to evade detection and ensure persistence.
   - Communicating with C2 servers is a common TTP for malware to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or download additional payloads.
   - Given that the malware is already using sophisticated techniques to avoid detection (downloader and decryption), it is highly likely that the new variant would also include communication with C2 servers as part of its TTPs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the context and the nature of malware, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would include communication with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
