Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     1. Achieving persistence by creating registry keys.
     2. Storing a unique GUID for the compromised host.
     3. Hijacking legitimate services.
     4. Updating the Trojan to evade detection by recompiling it without changing the PE header hashes.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the initial TTPs (persistence, GUID storage, and service hijacking), the Emissary Trojan authors will recompile the Trojan to evade detection.
     - Recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes is a common technique to evade signature-based detection. This is because signature-based detection relies on identifying known malicious patterns, and recompiling the code without altering the PE header hashes can help the malware avoid detection by these systems.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Emissary Trojan authors will not recompile the Trojan to evade detection.
     - This is less likely because recompiling the Trojan to evade detection is a standard practice in malware development to avoid signature-based detection mechanisms.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that are typical for establishing a foothold and maintaining persistence.
   - The final step in the sequence is to update the Trojan to evade detection, which is a logical next step in the lifecycle of a sophisticated piece of malware.
   - Recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes is a common technique to evade detection, making this a plausible action for the authors of the Emissary Trojan.

**Final Answer: A**
