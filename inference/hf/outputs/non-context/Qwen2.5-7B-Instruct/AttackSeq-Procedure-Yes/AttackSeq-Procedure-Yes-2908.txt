To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP: Mimikatz to Gain Domain Administrator Credentials**
   - The question mentions that the attacker uses Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials. This is a common TTP used by APTs to escalate privileges and gain deeper access within a network.

2. **Next TTP: Use of Stolen VPN Certificate**
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT15 will use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network. APT15 is known for using various methods to maintain persistence and access, and using stolen credentials, including certificates, is a plausible method.

3. **Subsequent TTP: Deployment of Backdoors**
   - The question also mentions the deployment of backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. These are known tools used by APTs to maintain long-term access and control over a network.

4. **Sequence Evaluation:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after gaining domain administrator credentials, APT15 would likely use a stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network and then deploy backdoors. This sequence aligns with typical APT behavior, where they use stolen credentials to gain access and then deploy additional tools to maintain control.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT15 would not use a stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network after gaining domain administrator credentials. This is less likely because using stolen credentials, including certificates, is a common method for maintaining access and control.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Gaining domain administrator credentials with Mimikatz is a common TTP.
2. Using stolen credentials (including certificates) to remotely access the network is a plausible next step.
3. Deploying backdoors is a common method for maintaining long-term access and control.

**Final Answer: Yes**
