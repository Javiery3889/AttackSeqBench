To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the question and the answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Gamaredon uses backdoors to list interesting files, such as Office documents.
   - The next step in the sequence is to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares mounted as drives, for sensitive data.
   - The final step is to automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after listing interesting files, Gamaredon would proceed to scan all drives for sensitive data and then upload the harvested documents to the C&C server.
     - This sequence aligns with typical advanced persistent threat (APT) behavior, where thorough data exfiltration is a common tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that after listing interesting files, Gamaredon would not proceed to scan all drives for sensitive data and would not upload the harvested documents to the C&C server.
     - This sequence does not align with the described attack sequence and seems less plausible.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Gamaredon uses backdoors to list interesting files and then scans all drives for sensitive data.
   - The logical next step would be to upload the harvested documents to the C&C server, as this is a common tactic for APTs to exfiltrate data.
   - Answer Choice A (Yes) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
