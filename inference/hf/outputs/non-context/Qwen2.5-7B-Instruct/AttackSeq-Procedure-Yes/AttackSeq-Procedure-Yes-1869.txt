Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural) used by the Scote malware.
   - The first TTP mentioned is the collection of C2 (Command and Control) information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers used Arabic language decoy documents as part of their phishing strategy during the initial access phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers used Arabic language decoy documents as part of their phishing strategy.
     - The use of Arabic language decoy documents would be a plausible tactic if the target audience is likely to be Arabic-speaking individuals or organizations.
     - However, the question does not provide any specific information about the target audience or the language preferences of the victims.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not use Arabic language decoy documents.
     - Without any specific information about the target audience or the language preferences of the victims, it is difficult to definitively say that Arabic language decoy documents were not used.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question does not provide any context about the target audience or the language preferences of the victims.
   - The use of Arabic language decoy documents would be a plausible tactic if the target audience is likely to be Arabic-speaking individuals or organizations.
   - However, without specific information about the target audience, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Arabic language decoy documents were used or not.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the lack of specific information about the target audience, the most plausible answer is that we cannot definitively say whether Arabic language decoy documents were used or not.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "No" because the question asks for the likelihood, and without specific information, it is more reasonable to assume that the tactic was not used.

Final Answer: B: No
