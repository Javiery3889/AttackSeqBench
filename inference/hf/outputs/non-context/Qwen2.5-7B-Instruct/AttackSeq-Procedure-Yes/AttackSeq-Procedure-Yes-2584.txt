To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step.

1. **System Information Gathering**: The malware has already gathered system information such as the hostname, user details, and active TCP connections. This is a common initial step in many malware operations, often referred to as reconnaissance.

2. **Communication with C&C Servers**: After gathering the necessary information, the next logical step would be to communicate with the Command and Control (C&C) servers to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate the gathered data.

3. **Use of Application Layer Protocols**: The question specifically asks if the malware is likely to communicate with the C&C servers using application layer protocols. Application layer protocols are commonly used for this purpose because they can be more easily obfuscated and can blend in with normal network traffic, making detection more difficult.

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs described in the question (gathering system information and then communicating with C&C servers) is a typical behavior of malware. The use of application layer protocols for communication is also a common practice to avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the typical behavior of malware after gathering system information, which is to communicate with C&C servers using application layer protocols.
- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the malware does not communicate with C&C servers using application layer protocols, which is less likely given the typical behavior of malware.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
