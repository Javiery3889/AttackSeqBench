To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that MargulasRAT maintains persistence through registry keys and VBScripts.
   - It then asks if SideCopy is likely to employ tactics to evade detection by mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy would use tactics to evade detection, such as mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.
     - Mimicking legitimate processes and using decoy documents are common tactics used by malware to evade detection. These tactics are often employed to blend in with normal system activity and avoid raising alarms.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy would not use such tactics to evade detection.
     - If SideCopy does not use these tactics, it would be more likely to be detected by security systems that monitor for such behaviors.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - MargulasRAT uses persistence mechanisms like registry keys and VBScripts, which are common for maintaining long-term access.
   - The question asks about SideCopy's likelihood of using evasion tactics, which are also common in the malware landscape.
   - Mimicking legitimate processes and using decoy documents are effective ways to avoid detection by security systems that monitor for suspicious activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that evasion tactics are common in malware to avoid detection, and considering the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that SideCopy would indeed use such tactics.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: "Final Answer: A"
