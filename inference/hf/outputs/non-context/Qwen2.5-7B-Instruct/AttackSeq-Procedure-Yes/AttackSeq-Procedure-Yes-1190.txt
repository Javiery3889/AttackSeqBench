Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used the RMS (Remote Management Software) tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement.
   - The goal was to evade defenses.
   - The RMS executable is likely to communicate with a C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - The C2 server is located in Germany.
   - The communication is expected to use application layer protocols.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - RMS tools are often used for reconnaissance and lateral movement, which aligns with the attackers' goal of evading defenses.
     - Communication with a C2 server is a common tactic used by attackers to maintain control over compromised systems.
     - Application layer protocols are frequently used for C2 communications as they can be more difficult to detect and block compared to lower-level protocols.
     - The location of the C2 server in Germany does not inherently make this scenario less plausible, as C2 servers can be located anywhere.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the RMS executable would not communicate with a C2 server in Germany using application layer protocols.
     - This is less plausible because the use of application layer protocols for C2 communications is a common and effective tactic.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The RMS tool is used for reconnaissance and lateral movement, which are typical activities in an attack sequence.
   - The use of a C2 server for maintaining control over the compromised system is a standard practice.
   - Application layer protocols are often used for C2 communications to avoid detection by network defenses.
   - The location of the C2 server in Germany does not invalidate the use of application layer protocols for communication.

**Final Answer: Yes**
