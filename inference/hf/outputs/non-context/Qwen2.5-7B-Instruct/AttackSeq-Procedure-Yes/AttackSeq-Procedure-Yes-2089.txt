Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers initially compromised endpoints using domain administrative credentials obtained through credential access.
   - They then used these compromised endpoints to discover additional vulnerable targets.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before moving across the entire infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers had a strategy to find admin-level credentials before moving across the entire infrastructure.
     - Given that the attackers already compromised domain administrative credentials, it is plausible that they would continue to seek out additional admin-level credentials to enhance their foothold and facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not aim to find admin-level credentials before moving across the entire infrastructure.
     - This would imply that the attackers relied solely on the initial compromised credentials and did not seek additional admin-level credentials, which seems less likely given the nature of advanced persistent threats (APTs) and the need for persistence and broader access.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers initially compromised domain administrative credentials, which are highly valuable for gaining access to the network.
   - They then used these credentials to discover and compromise additional endpoints, indicating a strategy to expand their access.
   - It is logical to assume that attackers would continue to seek out additional admin-level credentials to maintain and expand their access, especially in a large infrastructure where multiple admin accounts might exist.
   - The question implies a sequence where the attackers are already in a position to discover and compromise additional endpoints, suggesting they are likely to continue their efforts to find and exploit admin-level credentials.

**Final Answer: Yes**
