To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step.

1. **Loading Encrypted Executables into Legitimate System Processes (Process Hollowing):**
   - This is a common technique used by malware to hide its malicious code within legitimate processes, making it harder to detect.

2. **Persistence Mechanism:**
   - The question asks if Dexphot (a known malware) is likely to use `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- **Reasoning:**
  - Using `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks is a common method for malware to ensure persistence. This allows the malware to run at regular intervals, ensuring it remains active on the system even after a reboot or system updates.
  - This method is effective because `schtasks.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, making it less suspicious to system administrators and users.

**B: No**
- **Reasoning:**
  - There is no specific information provided that contradicts the use of `schtasks.exe` for persistence. Without additional context suggesting otherwise, it is reasonable to assume that Dexphot might use this method.

### Conclusion:
Given that `schtasks.exe` is a legitimate and commonly used method for ensuring persistence, and there is no information provided that would suggest Dexphot does not use this method, the most plausible answer is that Dexphot would indeed use `schtasks.exe` for persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
