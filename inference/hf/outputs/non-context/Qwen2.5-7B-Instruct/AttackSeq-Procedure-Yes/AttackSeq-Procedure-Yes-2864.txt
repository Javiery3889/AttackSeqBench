Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     - Modifying the CCleaner binary to execute malicious code.
     - Decrypting a multi-stage payload.
     - Establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel.
     - Using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the described actions (modifying the binary, decrypting the payload), the malware would indeed establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information via HTTPS POST requests.
     - This is a plausible sequence of TTPs because:
       - Establishing a C2 channel is a common post-exploitation activity for malware.
       - Using HTTPS POST requests for communication is a standard method to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
       - Encrypting and encoding the data adds an extra layer of obfuscation, making it harder for defenders to analyze the traffic.

   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware would not establish a C2 channel using the described method.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - The described actions (modifying the binary, decrypting the payload) are preparatory steps for post-exploitation activities.
       - Establishing a C2 channel is a necessary step for the malware to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Choice A, as it aligns with common malware behavior and the described actions.

Final Answer: A
