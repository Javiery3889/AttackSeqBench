To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the initial access is achieved through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file. This is a common TTP where attackers use a zero-day or known vulnerability to deliver a payload.

2. **Downloader Execution**: The next step is the execution of the MSIL/Crimson malware, which is the embedded downloader file. This is a typical behavior where the initial payload (downloader) is used to download and execute the main payload.

3. **Download of Full RAT Component**: The question mentions that the MSIL/Crimson malware will download the full Remote Access Tool (RAT) component from the specified IP address (213.136.87[.]122:10001). This is a standard TTP where the initial payload is used to download the full suite of tools that the attacker will use to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

4. **Command and Control (C2) Establishment**: The final step is establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol. This is a common TTP where the malware sets up a communication channel with the attacker's server to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. The steps of initial access, execution of the downloader, downloading the full RAT component, and establishing a custom C2 channel are all plausible and consistent with the attack sequence described.

- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. If the answer were "No," it would imply that one or more of the steps in the sequence are not likely to occur, which is not supported by the information provided.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question, and the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
