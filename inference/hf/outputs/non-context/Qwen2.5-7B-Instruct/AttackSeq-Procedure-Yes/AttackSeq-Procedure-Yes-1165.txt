To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Initial Infection**: The question states that a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document is used to infect a target with Plexor malware. This is a common initial attack vector used by threat actors to gain a foothold in a network.

2. **Avoiding Detection**: The question then asks if Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities. This implies that the threat actor (presumably Longhorn) is aware of the need to remain undetected while conducting further reconnaissance.

3. **System Fingerprinting and Discovery**: The question mentions that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities. This is a typical espionage-focused activity where the threat actor gathers information about the target's environment to understand the network and systems better.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This suggests that Longhorn's tools will indeed follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery. This is a logical sequence because it aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated threat actors who aim to remain undetected while gathering intelligence.

- **B: No** - This suggests that Longhorn's tools will not follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery. This would imply that the threat actor is likely to be detected, which is less likely for a sophisticated threat actor like Longhorn.

Given the context and the nature of Longhorn's activities, it is more plausible that they would follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing further reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A**
