To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Exploitation**: The attack starts with the execution of hidden objects in an Excel document, exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution. This is a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution without user interaction.

2. **Hiding Artifacts**: The next step mentioned is hiding artifacts. T1158 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework refers to the technique of creating or modifying hidden files and directories to avoid detection.

3. **Credential Harvesting**: After hiding the artifacts, the attack proceeds to search for and extract credentials from the registry or stored files. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that after the initial exploitation and silent code execution, the attack will indeed hide artifacts using T1158 before proceeding to extract credentials. This sequence makes logical sense as it helps the attacker evade detection and ensures a smoother extraction of credentials.

- **B: No** - This choice suggests that the attack will not hide artifacts using T1158 before extracting credentials. This would imply that the attacker is not concerned about hiding their tracks, which is less likely in a sophisticated attack scenario.

Given the logical flow of an attack, where hiding artifacts is a common practice to avoid detection, the most plausible sequence is to hide artifacts first.

**Final Answer: A**
