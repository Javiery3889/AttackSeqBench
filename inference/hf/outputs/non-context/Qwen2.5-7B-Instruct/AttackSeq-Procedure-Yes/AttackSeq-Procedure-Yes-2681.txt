Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a malware (KiraV2) that communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) server using encoded port numbers and hard-coded IP addresses.
   - It then asks if it is likely that KiraV2 will perform various types of DDoS attacks to disrupt the availability of targeted services and infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - KiraV2 is described as a malware that communicates with its C&C server. This communication is a common initial step in many malware operations.
     - The use of encoded port numbers and hard-coded IP addresses suggests that the malware is designed to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
     - Performing DDoS attacks is a common tactic used by malware to disrupt services and infrastructure, which aligns with the goal of maintaining control over the target network and causing disruption.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - There is no information provided in the question that suggests KiraV2 is not capable of or does not perform DDoS attacks.
     - The question does not provide any context that would indicate KiraV2 is not designed to perform such attacks.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes KiraV2 as a malware that communicates with its C&C server using encoded port numbers and hard-coded IP addresses. This behavior is consistent with malware that aims to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - The question also asks if it is likely that KiraV2 will perform DDoS attacks. Given that DDoS attacks are a common tactic used by malware to disrupt services and infrastructure, and there is no information provided that suggests KiraV2 is not capable of or does not perform such attacks, it is reasonable to conclude that KiraV2 is likely to perform DDoS attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
