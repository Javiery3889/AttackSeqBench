Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Yellow Garuda group. The sequence includes:
1. Collection of messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts.
2. Use of a Telegram 'grabber' tool for this collection.
3. Exfiltration of the collected data over the web.
4. Storage of the exfiltrated data in an SQLite database and JSON format.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It suggests that the collected data is indeed exfiltrated over the web and then stored in an SQLite database and JSON format.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. It suggests that the data is not exfiltrated over the web and not stored in an SQLite database and JSON format, which does not match the sequence provided in the question.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question clearly states that the Yellow Garuda group uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool to collect data from victims' Telegram accounts. This is a known tactic used by the group.
- The sequence then describes the exfiltration of this data over the web, which is a common method for data theft and espionage.
- Finally, the data is stored in an SQLite database and JSON format, which are common storage formats for structured and semi-structured data, respectively.

Given that all these steps are described in the question and align with known TTPs of the Yellow Garuda group, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: A
