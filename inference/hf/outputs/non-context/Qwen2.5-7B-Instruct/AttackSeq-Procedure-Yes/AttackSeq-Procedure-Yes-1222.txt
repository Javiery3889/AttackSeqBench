To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Privilege Escalation via DLL Sideloading**: This is a common technique used by APTs to gain elevated privileges on a system.

2. **Evading Defenses by Loading a Malicious DLL**: This step is also consistent with APT behavior, where they use techniques to avoid detection and analysis.

3. **Injecting Trochilus Payloads into Memory**: Trochilus is a malware family known for its ability to inject itself into processes, which aligns with the described TTP.

4. **Credential Theft using Mimikatz**: Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for credential theft, particularly for extracting credentials from memory. This is a plausible step following the injection of Trochilus.

5. **Accessing Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller**: This step is logical if the goal is to steal credentials and access sensitive information.

6. **Deploying Trochilus to Copy NTDS.DIT Database**: NTDS.DIT is the database file that contains user account information, including password hashes. Deploying Trochilus to copy this file is a common tactic for APTs to gain access to sensitive information.

Given the above analysis, the sequence described in the question is a plausible and common APT tactic, especially for APT10, which is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
