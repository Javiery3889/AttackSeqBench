Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Seaduke:** This refers to a technique or tool used by the Duke group to hide behind multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation to evade detection.
   - **Mimikatz PowerShell:** This is a tool used to extract credentials from memory, often used in post-exploitation to gain deeper access.
   - **Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks:** This is a method to use stolen Kerberos tickets to gain access to network resources.
   - **Retrieve system information:** This involves gathering information about the target system.
   - **Securely delete itself:** This refers to the malware or tool ensuring it is not detected by cleaning up its tracks.

2. **Evaluating the Sequence:**
   - **Seaduke (encryption and obfuscation):** This is a common initial step to evade detection.
   - **Mimikatz PowerShell (credential access):** This is a logical next step to gain deeper access by extracting credentials.
   - **Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks:** This is a method to maintain persistence and access by using stolen tickets.
   - **Retrieve system information:** This is a necessary step to understand the target environment.
   - **Securely delete itself:** This is a final step to ensure the malware is not detected.

3. **Answer Choices Analysis:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the logical sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - **B: No** - This choice contradicts the logical sequence of TTPs described in the question.

Given the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical order of operations for an advanced persistent threat (APT) group like the Duke group.

**Final Answer: A**
