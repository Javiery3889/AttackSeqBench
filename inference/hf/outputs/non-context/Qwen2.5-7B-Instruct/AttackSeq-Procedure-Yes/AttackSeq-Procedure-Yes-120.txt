Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two TTPs:
     - **Persistence:** Achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.
     - **Deploying Webshells:** Deploying webshells after achieving persistence.
   - The question then asks if Agrius (a known threat actor) is likely to leverage compromised accounts and use offensive security tools for lateral movement within the target network.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Agrius is known for its sophisticated tactics, particularly in the use of compromised accounts and offensive security tools for lateral movement. This aligns with the typical behavior of this threat actor.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that Agrius does not use compromised accounts and offensive security tools for lateral movement, which contradicts the known behavior of this threat actor.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Agrius is a known threat actor that employs a variety of sophisticated techniques to maintain access and move laterally within a network.
   - The use of compromised accounts and offensive security tools is a common tactic for Agrius to maintain persistence and move laterally.
   - The question's scenario of persistence and webshell deployment sets the stage for further actions, such as lateral movement, which is a natural progression in an attack lifecycle.

**Final Answer: Yes**
