Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The malware ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery:** The malware fetches computer name and user name information.
   - **Communication:** The malware communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant is likely to perform the following actions in sequence:
       1. Ensure persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
       2. Fetch computer name and user name information.
       3. Communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
     - This sequence aligns with typical malware behavior, where after establishing persistence, it often gathers information about the infected system before communicating with its command and control (C2) servers.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant is unlikely to perform the discovery activities (fetching computer name and user name information) and communication with control servers after ensuring persistence.
     - This does not align with the typical behavior of malware, which often needs to gather information about the infected system before communicating with its C2 servers.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is the one that includes the discovery activities (fetching computer name and user name information) before communication with control servers.

**Final Answer: A**
