To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Regin during the discovery phase, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization**: This is a common TTP for many malware families, including Regin, to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

2. **Scanning for Deleted Files**: This TTP is also consistent with Regin's behavior, as it helps the malware to identify and exfiltrate files that may have been deleted by the victim or security measures.

3. **Monitoring Network Traffic and Sniffing Low-Level Network Traffic**: This TTP is highly indicative of Regin's capabilities. Regin is known for its sophisticated network reconnaissance and data exfiltration capabilities, which include monitoring and sniffing network traffic to collect sensitive information.

Given these points, Regin is indeed likely to perform these actions as part of its attack sequence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Regin's known TTPs include gathering information on processes and memory utilization, which aligns with the first part of the question.
2. Scanning for deleted files is another known TTP for Regin, matching the second part of the question.
3. Monitoring and sniffing network traffic are also well-documented TTPs for Regin, making it a logical next step in the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
