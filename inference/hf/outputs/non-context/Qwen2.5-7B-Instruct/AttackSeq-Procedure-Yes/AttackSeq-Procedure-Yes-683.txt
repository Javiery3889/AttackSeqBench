Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an initial exploitation of vulnerabilities (MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler) for lateral movement.
- It then asks if Stuxnet is likely to use encrypted channels for communication with its Command and Control (C&C) servers to send system information and receive commands or updates.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Stuxnet is known for its sophisticated nature and the use of multiple attack vectors, including the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- One of the key characteristics of Stuxnet is its ability to maintain persistence and stealth, which often involves using encrypted communication channels to avoid detection by network security systems.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Stuxnet is a highly advanced piece of malware that was designed to be stealthy and persistent. It is known to use encrypted channels for communication with its C&C servers to ensure that its activities are not easily detected by network monitoring tools.
- The use of encrypted channels is a common practice in advanced malware to protect command and control communications from being intercepted or analyzed.
- Given the sophistication of Stuxnet and its need to maintain stealth and persistence, it is highly likely that it would use encrypted channels for communication with its C&C servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
