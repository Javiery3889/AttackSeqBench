Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by cybercriminals:
     1. Reconnaissance using tools like masscan and search engines (Shodan and Censys).
     2. Discovery of outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the cybercriminals would likely discover outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol after using masscan and search engines.
     - Masscan and search engines like Shodan and Censys are known for identifying open ports, services, and devices on the internet. Outdated systems and devices that support common protocols like MQTT are often found in such scans, especially in less secure or less updated networks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the cybercriminals would not likely discover outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol after using masscan and search engines.
     - This is less plausible because masscan and search engines are designed to find such devices, and MQTT is a common protocol used in IoT devices, including Building Management systems and medical devices.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the nature of the tools used (masscan and search engines) and the commonality of outdated systems and MQTT protocol support in Building Management systems and medical devices, it is highly likely that the cybercriminals would discover such systems.

**Final Answer: A**
