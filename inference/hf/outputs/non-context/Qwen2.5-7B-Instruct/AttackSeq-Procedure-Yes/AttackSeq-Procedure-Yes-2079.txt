Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by RIG EK (Exploit Kit) in its operations:
1. Use of proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
2. Return of encrypted exploit code.
3. Use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. RIG EK is known to use sophisticated techniques to evade detection and to encrypt the exploit code to avoid signature-based detection. The use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel is plausible as it would add another layer of obfuscation and make the communication more difficult to intercept and analyze.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. If RIG EK were not using these techniques, it would be less effective in evading detection and ensuring the success of its operations.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- RIG EK is a known exploit kit that employs various techniques to evade detection and ensure the success of its operations.
- The use of proxy servers to make infections harder to detect is a common TTP used by many exploit kits, including RIG EK.
- The return of encrypted exploit code is also a common practice to avoid detection by security systems.
- The use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel is plausible and aligns with the known tactics of RIG EK to ensure secure and undetected communication with its command and control servers.

Final Answer: A
