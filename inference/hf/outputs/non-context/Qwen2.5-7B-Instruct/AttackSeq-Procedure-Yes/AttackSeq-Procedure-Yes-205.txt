To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Execution**: The question states that FamousSparrow uses `cmd.exe` to execute the `SparrowDoor` backdoor. This is a common method for initial execution in many cyber attacks.

2. **Discovery**: After execution, the question suggests that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files. This aligns with the Discovery phase, where the attacker gathers information about the target environment to understand its structure and identify potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Credential Access**: The final step mentioned is the dumping of credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz. This is a typical method for gaining deeper access and maintaining persistence in the target network.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It follows a logical progression from initial execution to discovery and then to credential access, which is a common and plausible sequence in many cyber attacks.

- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely, which contradicts the typical attack lifecycle and the information provided in the question.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed likely to occur.

Final Answer: A
