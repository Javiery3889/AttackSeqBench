Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Reconnaissance with DOCKERGEDDON**: The question mentions the use of DOCKERGEDDON, a tool that scans netblocks, detects misconfigured Docker APIs, and deploys malicious containers. This indicates an initial phase of reconnaissance and exploitation targeting Docker environments.

2. **Compromised Websites for Malicious Files**: The question then asks if it is likely that attackers will leverage compromised websites to host malicious files. This is a common tactic where attackers use compromised web servers to host malicious content, making it harder to trace the origin of the files.

3. **Resource Development**: The question also mentions the development of attacker infrastructure, which could involve hosting tools, scripts, or other resources on compromised websites. This aligns with the idea of using compromised infrastructure to support ongoing operations.

4. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities with Open-Source Tools**: The final part of the question states that attackers will exploit vulnerabilities using open-source and offensive security tools. This is a plausible scenario as attackers often use publicly available tools to carry out their operations.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It is plausible that attackers would use compromised websites to host malicious files and develop their infrastructure, and then exploit vulnerabilities using open-source tools.
- **B: No**: This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. It would be less plausible if attackers did not use compromised websites for hosting malicious files and developing their infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A**
