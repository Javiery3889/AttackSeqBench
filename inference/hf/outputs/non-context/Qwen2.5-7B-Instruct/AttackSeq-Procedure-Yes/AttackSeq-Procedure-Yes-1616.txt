To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of APT28's known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that APT28 employs spear phishing emails with crafted documents to achieve initial access. This is a well-documented TTP for APT28.

2. **IP Range Scanning**: The question then asks if APT28 is likely to scan IP ranges using geographically distributed bots. This is a different TTP and is not typically associated with APT28's known methods. APT28 is more known for targeted attacks, often involving social engineering and exploitation of specific vulnerabilities in targeted organizations.

3. **Centralization of Vulnerabilities**: The question also mentions centralizing the identified vulnerabilities from the scan results. While this could be part of a broader attack strategy, it is not a primary TTP for APT28, which focuses more on targeted attacks rather than broad scanning and vulnerability collection.

Given the above analysis, APT28's known TTPs do not include the scanning of IP ranges using geographically distributed bots as a primary step in their attack sequence. Their methods are more focused on targeted attacks, often involving social engineering and exploitation of specific vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer: B**
