Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker (likely Turla) on compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - The attacker uses a PowerShell script to install LightNeuron.
   - LightNeuron is then used to execute system network configuration functions (GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName).
   - After gathering network information, the attacker uses LightNeuron to collect emails and exfiltrate local files based on specified rules.

2. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely for Turla to discover system network configurations via LightNeuron's ability to execute functions such as GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of Turla, which often uses reconnaissance to gather information about the target environment before executing further actions.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Turla would not use LightNeuron to discover system network configurations.
     - This does not align with the typical behavior of Turla, as reconnaissance is a crucial step in their attack lifecycle.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that Turla is known to conduct thorough reconnaissance to understand the target environment, it is highly plausible that they would use LightNeuron to gather network configuration information before proceeding with further actions such as collecting emails and exfiltrating files.

**Final Answer: A**
