Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion, followed by further phishing campaigns within a client's supply chain.
   - It then asks if it is likely that threat actors targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya cyber-attacks will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Threat actors often use reconnaissance to gather information about their targets, including the victim organization's structure, network topology, and security posture. This information is crucial for tailoring subsequent attacks, especially in a supply chain context.
     - The SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks were sophisticated and involved extensive reconnaissance to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the threat actors would not gather victim organization information, which is contrary to the typical behavior of advanced threat actors who rely on detailed reconnaissance to execute successful attacks.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks were highly targeted and involved significant reconnaissance efforts to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain.
   - Phishing campaigns are often used as a first step to gather information about the target organization, including network configurations, user credentials, and other sensitive data.
   - The reconnaissance phase is a critical part of the attack lifecycle, and threat actors typically invest significant resources in this phase to ensure the success of their subsequent actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that threat actors would indeed gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: Final Answer: A
