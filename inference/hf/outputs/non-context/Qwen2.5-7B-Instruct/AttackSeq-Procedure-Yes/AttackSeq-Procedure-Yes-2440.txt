Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     1. Injecting the NavShExt.dll into the Internet Explorer process.
     2. Creating a mutex named 'donotbotherme' to prevent duplicate executions.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Elise malware will employ defense evasion techniques such as heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation while exfiltrating data to the C2 server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Injecting a DLL into a process and creating a mutex are common initial access and persistence techniques. However, the question specifically asks about defense evasion techniques such as anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation during data exfiltration.
     - Elise malware, like many sophisticated malware families, is known for its advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection. Anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation are common methods used to evade security tools and analysis.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that Elise malware does not use such advanced evasion techniques, which is less likely given the nature of sophisticated malware.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial steps (DLL injection and mutex creation) are standard for establishing a foothold and maintaining persistence.
   - The question then shifts to the data exfiltration phase, where defense evasion techniques are crucial to avoid detection.
   - Elise malware, being a sophisticated piece of malware, is likely to employ such advanced evasion techniques to ensure its operations remain undetected.

**Final Answer: Yes**
