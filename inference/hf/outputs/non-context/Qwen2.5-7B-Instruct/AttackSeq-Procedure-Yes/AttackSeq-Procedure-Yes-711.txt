Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Spear phishing email: This is the initial contact with the target.
   - Malicious XLS document: The spear phishing email contains a malicious Excel document.
   - Macro code execution: The document contains macro code that is executed.
   - First payload drop: The macro code drops the first payload.
   - Subsequent download: The first payload leads to the download of Crimson RAT.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible.
     - Spear phishing is a common method for initial compromise.
     - Malicious XLS documents with macro code are a well-known vector for delivering malware.
     - The execution of macro code to drop a payload and then download additional malware (like Crimson RAT) is a typical behavior in many malware campaigns.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is not plausible.
     - There is no specific information provided that would make this sequence implausible. Each step in the sequence is a common and well-documented method in cyber attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that each step in the sequence is a common and plausible method in cyber attacks, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

Final Answer: A
