Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Staging Data for Exfiltration**: The question mentions that data is staged for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools. This is a common technique used by APTs to avoid detection and to manage large data transfers.

2. **Remote Command Execution Scripts**: The use of remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools is also a typical method used by APTs to maintain operational security and automate tasks.

3. **Dynamic-DNS Domains for C2 Infrastructure**: The question asks if APT10 is likely to use dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2) infrastructure. Dynamic-DNS (DDNS) is a method of automatically updating domain names to reflect the current IP address of a host. This is often used by APTs to maintain a covert and resilient C2 channel.

4. **Tools Mentioned (Robocopy and PSCP)**: Robocopy is a command-line utility for copying files and directories, and PSCP is a command-line tool for securely transferring files to and from remote machines. While these tools are not directly related to DDNS, they are commonly used by APTs for data exfiltration and lateral movement.

5. **APT10's TTPs**: APT10, also known as OilRig, is known for using a variety of techniques to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. They often use dynamic-DNS for C2 infrastructure to avoid detection and maintain control over their operations.

Given the above points, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with APT10's known methods. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that APT10 would likely use dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A**
