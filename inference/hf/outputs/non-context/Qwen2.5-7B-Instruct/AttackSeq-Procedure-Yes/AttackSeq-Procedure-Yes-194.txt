Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Remote code execution vulnerabilities are exploited for Initial Access.
2. The cmd.exe is used to execute SparrowDoor for Execution.
3. The next step is to determine if SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
- Answer Choice B: No

Given the context of modern cyber threats, it is highly likely that an attacker would use encrypted channels for Command and Control (C&C) communications to avoid detection by network security measures. Encrypted HTTPS channels are a common method used by malware and attackers to maintain stealth and ensure secure communication with the C&C server.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities are a common entry point for attackers, as they provide direct access to the system.
- SparrowDoor, being a piece of malware, would likely use encrypted channels to communicate with its C&C server to avoid detection by network monitoring tools and to ensure secure command and control.
- HTTPS is a widely used and easily implementable method for encrypted communication, making it a plausible choice for C&C communications.

Final Answer: A: Yes
