To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Exploiting Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**: The question mentions exploiting Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access. This is a common TTP used by advanced threat actors to bypass traditional defenses.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: The attack sequence then mentions achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956. These vulnerabilities are known to be used for privilege escalation, which is a critical step to gain deeper access within the network.

3. **Stager Module**: A stager module is typically used to download and execute the main payload or dropper module. It acts as a bridge between the initial access and the final payload. The stager is often designed to be stealthy and to minimize the footprint.

4. **Dropper Module**: The dropper module is the main payload that carries out the malicious intent of the attack, such as installing malware, stealing data, or establishing a persistent backdoor.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This suggests that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing the Dropper module. This is a plausible scenario because the stager module might have a mechanism to report back to the attacker to confirm successful exploitation and to ensure that the next steps can proceed.

- **B: No**: This suggests that the Stager module will not notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing the Dropper module. While this is possible, it is less common because it would make the attack less controllable and more prone to failure if the initial steps do not succeed.

Given the nature of the stager module, which is designed to ensure that the next steps in the attack are executed only after confirming the success of the initial steps, the most plausible sequence is that the stager module would notify of successful exploitation.

**Final Answer: A**
