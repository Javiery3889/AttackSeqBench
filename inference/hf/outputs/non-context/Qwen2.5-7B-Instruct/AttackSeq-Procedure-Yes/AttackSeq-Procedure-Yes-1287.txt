Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The campaign starts by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document. This is a common initial access technique where attackers use social engineering to trick users into opening the document and executing the embedded scripts.

2. **Execution of Encoded Scripts**: The scripts are executed through macro-triggered events. This is a typical method to bypass security measures that block or warn about suspicious macros.

3. **Decoding and Dropping Components**: After execution, the encoded scripts are decoded. This step is crucial as it reveals the actual malicious payload. The decoded scripts are then used to drop components like `invoker.ps1`. This is a common tactic for persistence, where the attacker ensures the malware remains on the system even after the initial infection vector is removed.

4. **Persistence**: The `invoker.ps1` script is used for persistence. This script is likely to be a PowerShell script that sets up mechanisms for the malware to remain active on the system, such as creating scheduled tasks, modifying registry keys, or using other methods to ensure the malware can re-infect the system.

5. **Obfuscation for Defense Evasion**: Finally, the campaign employs obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload. This is a standard technique to evade detection by security software that relies on signature-based detection. Obfuscation can make the payload harder to identify and analyze.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the typical sequence of TTPs described in the question. The campaign follows a logical progression from initial access, through execution, to persistence, and finally, defense evasion.
- **B: No** - This choice does not align with the described sequence. If the campaign did not use decoded scripts to drop components and then obfuscate the payload, it would deviate significantly from the standard attack lifecycle.

**Final Answer: A**
