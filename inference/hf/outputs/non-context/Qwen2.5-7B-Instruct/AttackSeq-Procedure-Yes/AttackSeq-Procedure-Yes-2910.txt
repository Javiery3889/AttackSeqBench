Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the TTPs Involved:**
   - **AtomBombing:** This technique involves leveraging Windows operating system mechanisms to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, making it harder to detect.
   - **Bypassing AV/NGAV/Endpoint Infiltration Prevention:** This refers to the strategy used by threat actors to avoid detection by security solutions.

2. **Evaluating the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question states that after using AtomBombing, the threat actors will likely use a defense evasion strategy to bypass security solutions like antivirus, next-generation antivirus, and endpoint infiltration prevention.

3. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that it is likely the threat actors will use a defense evasion strategy to bypass the mentioned security solutions.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that it is unlikely the threat actors will use a defense evasion strategy to bypass the mentioned security solutions.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - AtomBombing is a sophisticated technique that can make malicious code hard to detect because it is embedded within legitimate processes. Threat actors often follow up such techniques with additional evasion tactics to ensure their malicious activities remain undetected.
   - Bypassing security solutions like antivirus, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention is a common follow-up step in many advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns. These solutions are designed to detect and prevent malicious activities, and threat actors frequently employ various evasion techniques to circumvent them.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the nature of AtomBombing and the typical behavior of threat actors, it is highly likely that they would use additional tactics to bypass security solutions.

**Final Answer: A**
