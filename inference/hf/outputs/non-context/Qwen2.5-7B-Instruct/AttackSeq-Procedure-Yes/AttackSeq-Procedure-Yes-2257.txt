To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with the delivery of a COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department (SAT). This is a common tactic used to trick users into downloading and opening malicious files.

2. **Execution**: The next step is to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet. This is a plausible follow-up action as PowerShell can be used to download and execute scripts from the internet, which is a common method for attackers to evade traditional antivirus solutions and execute malicious code in memory.

3. **Persistence**: The final step mentioned is ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks. This is a standard method for attackers to ensure their malware remains active even after a system reboot or when the user logs out.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It logically follows the initial access via a phishing email, the execution of a PowerShell script, and then ensuring persistence through startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.
  
- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. If the attack proceeds as described, it would be illogical to say "No" to the sequence of TTPs.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
