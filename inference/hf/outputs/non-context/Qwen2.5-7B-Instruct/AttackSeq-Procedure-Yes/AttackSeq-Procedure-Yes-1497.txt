To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each step in the context of the provided answer choices.

1. **DarkHydrus Spear-Phishing Emails**: This is the initial attack vector where the adversary uses spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious content. This is a common and effective method for gaining initial access.

2. **Malicious Excel Web Query Files**: These files are used to deliver the payload. Excel Web Query files can be used to execute malicious code when opened, which is a sophisticated technique to bypass traditional email filters.

3. **RogueRobin PowerShell Payload**: This payload is executed in the victim environment. PowerShell is a common target for attackers due to its flexibility and the fact that it is often not monitored as closely as other executables.

4. **Sandbox Detection Techniques and Obfuscation**: These are techniques used to evade detection by security tools. Sandboxing is a common environment for security solutions to analyze suspicious files, and obfuscation makes the code harder to analyze.

5. **OneDrive.ps1 for Persistence**: This script is executed on user login to ensure the malware remains active. OneDrive.ps1 is a known technique to maintain persistence by leveraging legitimate Microsoft services.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible. It aligns with the typical methods used by advanced adversaries to maintain stealth and persistence.

- **B: No**: This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible. However, given the sophistication of modern malware and the techniques mentioned, this sequence is indeed plausible.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Initial Access**: DarkHydrus spear-phishing emails are a common method for gaining initial access.
2. **Delivery of Payload**: Malicious Excel Web Query files are a sophisticated method to deliver the payload.
3. **Execution of Payload**: PowerShell is a common and flexible tool for executing malicious code.
4. **Evasion Techniques**: Sandboxing detection and obfuscation are common techniques to evade security tools.
5. **Persistence**: OneDrive.ps1 is a known method to maintain persistence.

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described is indeed plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
