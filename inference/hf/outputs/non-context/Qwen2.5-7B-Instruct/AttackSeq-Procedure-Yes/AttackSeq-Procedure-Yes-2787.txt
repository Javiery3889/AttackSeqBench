To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - The app collects various types of data (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data).
   - The app performs routines on the iOS device.
   - The app sends the gathered information via HTTP.
   - The app uploads files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.

2. **Answer Choices Analysis:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the app first collects data and performs routines, then sends the data via HTTP, and finally uploads files via FTP for C2 operations.
   - In the context of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is common for malware to use multiple protocols for data exfiltration and C2 communication. HTTP is often used for initial data exfiltration due to its widespread use and ease of detection, while FTP might be used for more sensitive data or for uploading files that are part of the C2 infrastructure.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with typical behavior observed in malware and cyber attacks, where different protocols are used at different stages of the attack lifecycle.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware and the described sequence of TTPs, the sequence is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
