Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers are initially monitoring targets via benign emails to understand their click habits and email click rates. This is a form of social engineering to gather information about the target's behavior.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use social media mobile apps to steal identifiable information such as contact lists, emails, and SMS contents during their reconnaissance activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: Yes**
     - This option suggests that after gathering information through benign emails, the attackers will use social media mobile apps to steal more detailed information. This is plausible because social media apps often have access to a wide range of personal data, including contact lists, emails, and SMS contents. Attackers can leverage this access to gather more detailed and sensitive information about the target.
   - **Option B: No**
     - This option suggests that the attackers will not use social media mobile apps for this purpose. However, given the nature of social media apps and their access to personal data, this seems less likely unless there is a specific reason provided in the question that contradicts this.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already gathered some information through benign emails, which indicates they are looking to gather more detailed and sensitive information.
   - Social media mobile apps are known to have extensive access to personal data, making them a valuable tool for attackers to gather such information.
   - There is no information in the question that suggests the attackers would not use social media mobile apps for this purpose.

**Final Answer: A**
