To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts, we need to analyze the sequence of actions described in the question and match them with the appropriate ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that malicious scripts (cookie stealers and webmail session key manipulators) were executed.
   - These scripts were used to inject persistent JavaScript through XSS vulnerabilities.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target to be used in the attack. While it is a crucial step, it does not directly lead to the execution of malicious scripts or the injection of JavaScript.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running the malicious code or scripts. The question states that malicious scripts were executed, so this is a direct action but not the preceding step.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's environment. This is a logical precursor to executing malicious scripts and injecting JavaScript, as the adversary must first gain access to the system or network.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary controlling the compromised system. While this is a critical step, it is not the initial step that precedes the execution of malicious scripts.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the adversary gains access to the target environment, then executes malicious scripts, and finally injects persistent JavaScript through XSS vulnerabilities.
   - The most logical step that precedes the execution of malicious scripts is gaining initial access to the target environment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: C: Initial Access
