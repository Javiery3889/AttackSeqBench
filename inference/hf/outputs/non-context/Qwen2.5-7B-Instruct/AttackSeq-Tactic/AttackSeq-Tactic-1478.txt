To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the options provided.

1. **Secure Communication**: The question mentions that the Duke group used layered encryption and encoding to communicate with their command-and-control (C2) server. This is a tactic used to maintain persistence and control over the compromised systems, which is directly related to the "Command and Control" (T1071) tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Managing Compromised Systems**: After establishing secure communication, the next logical step would be to manage the compromised systems. This involves moving laterally within the network, collecting data, and potentially exfiltrating it.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it is a crucial step in an attack, it typically follows the initial compromise and the establishment of a foothold, which in this case, is the secure communication with the C2 server.

- **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data from the target system to an external location. This is also a critical step but usually comes after the attacker has collected the necessary information.

- **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This is a step that often follows the initial compromise and the establishment of a foothold, which is the secure communication with the C2 server.

- **D: Command and Control**: This is the tactic that involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the C2 channel. The question already states that the Duke group has securely communicated with their C2 server, so this step has already occurred.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most logical step after establishing secure communication with the C2 server would be to move laterally within the network to manage the compromised systems effectively.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
