Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack began with a CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit via watering hole attacks. This is clearly an Initial Access tactic.

2. **Next TTPs**: After gaining initial access, the next step would involve the attacker establishing a means of communication with the attacker's infrastructure. The question specifies that Poison Ivy RAT's communication involves domains such as diff.qohub.info. This indicates that the next step is Command and Control (C2).

3. **Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to the target network. While it is a common follow-up to initial access, it is not the immediate next step after gaining access.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This involves the theft of data from the target. It is a step that might occur later in the attack lifecycle but is not the immediate next step after gaining access.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This involves the attacker establishing a means to communicate with the compromised system. This aligns perfectly with the communication via the Poison Ivy RAT and the specified domains.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This is the first step, which has already been completed according to the question.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access is establishing a means of communication with the attacker's infrastructure, which is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
