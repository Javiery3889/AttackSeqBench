To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each step:

1. **Gathering Local Network Information**: The question mentions that BlackEnergy 3 malware used the GetAdaptersInfo() function API to gather local network information. This is a reconnaissance activity aimed at understanding the network environment.

2. **Sending Data to Servers**: The malware then sent this gathered data to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe. This action is indicative of data exfiltration, which is a part of the Command and Control (C2) process.

3. **Identifying the TTP Sequence**: The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the malware gathered local network information and before it sent data to the C2 servers. 

   - **Credential Access (A)**: This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is not directly related to the gathering of network information or data exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves establishing a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. The act of sending data to the C2 servers fits this description.
   - **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the described actions of gathering network information and sending data.
   - **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker initially gaining access to the target network. This would be the first step, not after gathering network information and before sending data.

Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that fits the described sequence is Command and Control, as it directly relates to the sending of data to the C2 servers.

**Final Answer: B**
