Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor, which installs persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS to communicate.
   - The RoyalDNS backdoor is a tool that provides persistence and communication capabilities.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence is the tactic that ensures the attacker can maintain access to the victim's network over a long period. The RoyalDNS backdoor is described as installing persistently, which aligns with the persistence tactic.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves the attacker developing tools, techniques, and procedures to support their operations. While the RoyalDNS backdoor is a tool, the question does not indicate that the attacker is developing new resources.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access privileges within the network. The question does not mention any actions that would lead to gaining higher privileges, such as exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the victim's network. The question does not mention any data being stolen or exfiltrated, only the deployment of a backdoor for persistence and communication.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor, which installs persistently and uses DNS to communicate, is persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Persistence**
