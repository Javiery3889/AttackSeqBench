Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attackers achieved initial access through spear-phishing emails and executing a Trojan backdoor through trusted software. This is a clear indication of the "Initial Access" tactic.

2. **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for Maintaining Access**: The question states that the attackers used RDP to maintain access to the victim networks. This is a form of "Persistence" as it allows the attackers to maintain long-term access to the network.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs described in the question is:
   - Initial Access (through spear-phishing and Trojan backdoor)
   - Persistence (using RDP to maintain access)

4. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by the defender. While it could be used in conjunction with other tactics, it does not directly relate to maintaining access.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. It is not directly related to maintaining access through RDP.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. It is not directly related to maintaining access through RDP.
   - **D: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network. Using RDP to maintain access is a clear example of persistence.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the nature of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the use of RDP for maintaining access is "Persistence."

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
