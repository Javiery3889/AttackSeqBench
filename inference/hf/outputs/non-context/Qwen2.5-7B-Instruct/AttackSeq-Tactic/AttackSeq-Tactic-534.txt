To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Tortoiseshell maintained persistence on the victim's system using the RAT named 'IvizTech'**:
   - This indicates that the initial compromise and persistence mechanism have been established. This is typically part of the initial access and persistence tactics.

2. **Before the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed information about the victim's machine**:
   - The reconnaissance phase involves gathering information about the target environment. This is a critical step in understanding the victim's network and systems.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Credential Access**:
   - This tactic involves stealing credentials. While it is a common step in reconnaissance, it is not necessarily the immediate next step after maintaining persistence. It could be part of the reconnaissance phase but is not the most direct step.

B. **Discovery**:
   - This tactic involves identifying users, systems, and network devices. This is a direct step after maintaining persistence, as the attacker would need to understand the environment before collecting detailed information. It logically follows the persistence phase and precedes detailed reconnaissance.

C. **Impact**:
   - This tactic involves actions that directly damage or alter the victim's systems. This is a step that typically occurs after the attacker has gathered enough information to carry out their objectives, which is not the immediate next step after maintaining persistence.

D. **Defense Evasion**:
   - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures. While this is a common tactic throughout the attack lifecycle, it is not the immediate next step after maintaining persistence.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible step after maintaining persistence and before detailed reconnaissance is the discovery phase. The attacker needs to understand the environment before collecting detailed information.

**Final Answer: B**
