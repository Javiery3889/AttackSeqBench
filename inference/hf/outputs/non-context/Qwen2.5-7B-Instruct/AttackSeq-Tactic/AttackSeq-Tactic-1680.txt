Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     - Obtaining usernames and passwords through credential stuffing or password spraying attacks.
     - Deploying Cobalt Strike via a PowerShell one-liner for establishing command execution.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. The question does not mention any data being stolen, so this is unlikely.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. The question mentions obtaining credentials, which is a common method of initial access.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code or scripts. The question states that Cobalt Strike was deployed via a PowerShell one-liner, which is a form of execution.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves the adversary ensuring that they can maintain access to the target system over time. While this could be a subsequent step, the question does not explicitly mention maintaining access after the initial deployment.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question clearly states that the adversary obtained credentials (username and password) through credential stuffing or password spraying. This is a method of initial access.
   - After obtaining the credentials, the adversary then deployed Cobalt Strike via a PowerShell one-liner, which is a form of execution.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Initial Access occurred first, followed by Execution.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
