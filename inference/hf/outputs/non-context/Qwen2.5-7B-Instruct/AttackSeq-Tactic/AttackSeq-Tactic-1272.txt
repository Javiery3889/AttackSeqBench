To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG1021 utilized SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the context provided.

1. **SharpHound and PowerSploit Usage**: These tools are typically used for reconnaissance and lateral movement. SharpHound is used for gathering information about the environment, including services, shares, and other details, while PowerSploit is a suite of PowerShell-based penetration testing tools that can be used for various tasks, including reconnaissance and privilege escalation.

2. **Context of Scanning and Mapping**: The question specifies that the actions were for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk. This implies that the initial step was likely to gather information about the target environment without leaving a trace, which aligns with the Discovery TTP.

3. **Evaluating Each Option**:
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**: This TTP involves gaining higher-level access to a system. While it is a critical step in many attacks, it is not the initial step for scanning and mapping.
   - **B: Discovery**: This TTP involves identifying and classifying information about the network and systems. It fits the context of gathering information without leaving traces on disk.
   - **C: Execution**: This TTP involves running malicious code or scripts. While it is a step in the attack chain, it is not the initial step for gathering information.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This TTP involves obtaining credentials to access systems. While it can be part of the attack, it is not the initial step for scanning and mapping.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would start with Discovery, as it aligns with the initial step of gathering information about the target environment.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
