Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions XtremeRAT, which is a backdoor tool.
   - It states that the backdoor maintains and references configuration data for command and control.
   - The attacker then utilized functionalities such as interacting with the victim via a remote shell and file manipulation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The backdoor (XtremeRAT) is used to maintain a persistent presence and control over the victim's system.
   - The attacker then uses the backdoor to interact with the victim via a remote shell, which is a form of remote access.
   - File manipulation is also mentioned, which involves changing or managing files on the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to be used in a future attack. While the backdoor might be used for reconnaissance, the question focuses on the interaction and manipulation, which are more aligned with post-exploitation activities.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While file manipulation could be part of data collection, the question emphasizes the remote shell interaction, which is more about control and manipulation.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. While the backdoor itself is a form of execution, the question is more about the post-exploitation activities like remote shell and file manipulation.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker controlling the victim's system. The use of a remote shell and file manipulation are clear examples of the attacker exercising control over the victim's system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Command and Control.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
