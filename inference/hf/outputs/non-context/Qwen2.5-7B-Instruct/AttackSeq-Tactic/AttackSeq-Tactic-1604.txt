Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - The question mentions "GET requests sent by Microsoft Word," which indicates the attacker is using a legitimate application to send network requests.
   - "Bypassing detection by using an undocumented Word feature" suggests the attacker is trying to avoid detection while performing some action.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target's system. The question does not mention any initial access method, such as phishing or exploiting a vulnerability, but rather focuses on actions after the initial access.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information to better understand the target's environment. The question does not directly mention the attacker discovering information but rather performing actions within the environment.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the attacker obtaining credentials. The question does not mention any credential-related activities.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the attacker avoiding or thwarting defensive measures. The question mentions bypassing detection, which aligns with the goal of evading security measures.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes actions that are taking place after the initial access has been achieved. The attacker is using a legitimate application (Microsoft Word) to send GET requests and then bypassing detection by using an undocumented feature. This indicates that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is now trying to avoid detection while performing further actions.
   - The most plausible tactic that occurred prior to the bypass is "Defense Evasion" because the attacker is specifically trying to evade detection.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
