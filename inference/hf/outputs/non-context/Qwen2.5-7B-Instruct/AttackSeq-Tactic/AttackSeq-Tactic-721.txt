Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker first gathers system information using specific plugins (bs.dll, CPUID, and win32 API calls) via WMI.
   - Then, the 'dstr.dll' plugin is used to overwrite data on hard drives, which can disrupt availability or compromise integrity.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Gathering System Information:** This is a form of reconnaissance, which is closely related to the Discovery Tactic.
   - **Overwriting Data on Hard Drives:** This action directly impacts the system's availability and integrity, which aligns with the Impact Tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target environment. The question does not describe the initial access but rather actions taken after gaining access.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means of control over the compromised system. The question does not mention establishing control but rather actions taken after gaining access.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that directly affect the target, such as disrupting availability or integrity. Overwriting data on hard drives fits this description.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources and their characteristics. Gathering system information using WMI, CPUID, and win32 API calls aligns with this tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question, particularly the overwriting of data on hard drives, aligns most closely with the Impact Tactic.

Final Answer: C
