Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - APT10 conducted privilege escalation using DLL sideloading techniques.
   - They delivered malware.
   - They used Mimikatz for credential theft.
   - They accessed Visma's Active Directory domain controller.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This typically involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. The question does not mention any data being transferred out of the network, so this is unlikely.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This involves the theft of credentials, which is directly mentioned in the sequence as the step after delivering malware. However, the question specifies that Mimikatz was used for credential theft, which is a specific technique under Credential Access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence and does not logically follow the steps described.
   - **D: Discovery** - This involves the attacker learning about the target's environment, such as network topology, systems, and services. This is a logical step that would occur before using Mimikatz to steal credentials, as the attacker would need to understand the environment to target specific credentials.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question indicates that after privilege escalation and malware delivery, the next step would be to understand the environment to target specific credentials. This aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - Credential Access (B) is the step that follows Discovery, but it is not the most likely step immediately after privilege escalation and malware delivery.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
