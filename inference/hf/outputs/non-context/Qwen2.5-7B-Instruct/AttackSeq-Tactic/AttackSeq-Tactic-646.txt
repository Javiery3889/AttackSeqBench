Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Delivering Gh0st RAT via email.
     2. Employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic best fits between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. Delivering Gh0st RAT via email is a form of initial access, but it does not fit as a tactic between the two steps mentioned.
   - **B: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the adversary developing tools, techniques, and procedures. While this could be relevant to the development of Gh0st RAT, it does not fit as a tactic between the two steps mentioned.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running code or otherwise executing files on the target system. Employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL is a form of execution, as it involves running code on the target system.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves the adversary moving laterally within the network to other systems. This does not fit as a tactic between the two steps mentioned.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The first step, delivering Gh0st RAT via email, is a form of initial access.
   - The second step, employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL, is a form of execution.
   - The tactic that logically fits between these two steps is Execution, as it directly involves the running of code on the target system.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
