Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an attack campaign.
   - The sequence mentioned is:
     1. Gaining initial access through spear-phishing messages.
     2. Accessing credentials using phishing pages impersonating login services like Google Drive and Yahoo.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves the adversary's first step to gain a foothold in the target's network. The question clearly states that the initial access was gained through spear-phishing messages, which fits this tactic.
   - **Credential Access (B):** This tactic involves the adversary's actions to obtain credentials, such as passwords, tokens, or other forms of authentication. The question mentions accessing credentials using phishing pages, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **Privilege Escalation (A):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system or network. The question does not mention any actions to escalate privileges, so this does not fit the sequence.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves the adversary's actions to avoid being detected or investigated. While phishing could be a method of evasion, the question does not specifically mention evasion techniques, so this does not fit the sequence as well as the other options.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step (spear-phishing) is clearly an Initial Access technique.
   - The subsequent step (accessing credentials using phishing pages) is clearly a Credential Access technique.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred during the campaign, and the initial step is the first in the sequence.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
