Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described includes:
     - Evading defenses using a self-extracting wrapper file to conceal the Gh0st payload.
     - Executing the embedded DLL of the Trojan.
     - Establishing communication using a custom network protocol through its server hosted at 98.126.67.114.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. While the malware might use privilege escalation to further its objectives, the question specifically mentions communication through a custom network protocol, which is more directly related to establishing a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the malware used a self-extracting wrapper file to evade defenses. The question is asking about the next step after this evasion.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves the malware establishing a communication channel with its command and control server. The question explicitly states that the malware established communication using a custom network protocol through its server hosted at 98.126.67.114. This aligns perfectly with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - This tactic is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It involves developing and maintaining the resources used in the attack, which is not the next step after establishing a C2 channel.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware first evades defenses by using a self-extracting wrapper file.
   - It then executes the embedded DLL of the Trojan.
   - The next step, as described in the question, is establishing communication using a custom network protocol through its server.
   - This communication channel is a clear example of the Command and Control tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
