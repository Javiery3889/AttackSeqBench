To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Decoy Documents and Honeytraps**: This indicates that the attackers are using social engineering techniques to gain initial access and gather information about the target. This aligns with the **Reconnaissance** and **Discovery** tactics, as these tactics involve gathering information about the target and identifying vulnerabilities.

2. **Modular Plugins for File Enumeration, Browser Password Stealing, and Keylogging**: These actions are part of the **Collection** tactic, where the attackers are collecting data from the infected endpoints.

Given this sequence, we can deduce the following:
- The decoy documents and honeytraps are part of the initial reconnaissance and discovery phase.
- The modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging are part of the collection phase.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. The question does not mention any data being exfiltrated yet, so this is not the most likely next step.

B. **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the target network. While this is part of the initial phase, the question mentions decoy documents and honeytraps, which are more aligned with reconnaissance.

C. **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target. The modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging are clearly part of this tactic.

D. **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute an attack. The decoy documents and honeytraps are part of this phase.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible step after reconnaissance and before collection is the discovery of the target's network and systems. However, since the question is asking for the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial social engineering and before the collection phase, the best fit is the discovery of the target's systems and resources.

Final Answer: B: Discovery
