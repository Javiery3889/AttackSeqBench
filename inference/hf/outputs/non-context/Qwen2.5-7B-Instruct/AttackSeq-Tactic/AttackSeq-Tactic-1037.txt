Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that a command and control (C2) connection was established using a Chinese botnet and a stealth botnet targeting a finance server.
   - The key point here is the establishment of a C2 connection, which is a critical step in the cyber attack lifecycle.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the theft of data from the target system. While it is a common goal of cyber attacks, the question specifically mentions the establishment of a C2 connection, not the exfiltration of data.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the means to direct the compromised system. The question explicitly states that a C2 connection was established, which aligns perfectly with this tactic.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While this might be a step before exfiltration, the question does not mention any data collection activities.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources available on the network. The question does not mention any discovery activities; it focuses on the establishment of a C2 connection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question clearly states that a C2 connection was established using a botnet targeting a finance server.
   - The establishment of a C2 connection is a direct and primary action under the Command and Control tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - None of the other tactics (Exfiltration, Collection, or Discovery) are mentioned or implied in the question.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
