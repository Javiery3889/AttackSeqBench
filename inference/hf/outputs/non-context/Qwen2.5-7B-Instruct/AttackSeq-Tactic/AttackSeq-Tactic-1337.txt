To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each step.

1. **BlackEnergy Malware Activation**: The question mentions that BlackEnergy malware was activated. This indicates that the malware has been successfully delivered to the target system, which is part of the Initial Access Tactic.

2. **Assessment of Targets**: After the malware is activated, the operators need to assess the targets. This assessment phase is typically part of the Reconnaissance phase, which is not directly listed in the ATT&CK framework but is closely related to the Initial Access and Lateral Movement tactics.

3. **Deploying a Specific Variant**: The question states that a specific variant was deployed to assess the targets. This action is more closely aligned with the Execution Tactic, as it involves running or executing code on the target system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the infrastructure and methods used to direct the actions of malware or other malicious software. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate action after the malware is activated and a variant is deployed.

- **B: Execution**: This tactic involves the running or executing of code on the target system. Deploying a specific variant to assess the targets is a clear example of execution.

- **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the methods that threat actors use to introduce malware or other malicious content into the target environment. The question already states that the malware was activated, so this is not the next step.

- **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials from a host or network. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the immediate action of deploying a variant to assess the targets.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible next step after the malware is activated and a specific variant is deployed to assess the targets is the execution of that variant.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
