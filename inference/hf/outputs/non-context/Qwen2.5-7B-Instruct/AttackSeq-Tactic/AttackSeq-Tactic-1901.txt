Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware used 'Enigma Protector' for obfuscation.
   - Gathered basic system information.
   - Returned the results via the C&C server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems. The return of results via the C&C server is a clear indication of Command and Control activity.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. The information gathered and sent to the C&C server does not indicate movement to another system.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves the attacker developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure used in the attack. While the malware used 'Enigma Protector' for obfuscation, this is a tool used during the attack, not a tactic.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying information about the target's network and systems. Gathering basic system information is a form of discovery, but it is not the final step in the sequence described.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions described (obfuscation, gathering system information, and sending results to the C&C server) aligns most closely with the Command and Control tactic. The C&C server is the endpoint where the results of the discovery and other actions are sent, which is a key component of Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
