To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs in the given scenario, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each step:

1. **Initiation**: The Duke group used Trojan.Cozer via 'Office Monkeys'- and 'eFax'-themed emails to compromise high-profile government networks. This step involves initial access and the use of a malicious payload (Trojan.Cozer) delivered through social engineering (phishing emails).

2. **TTPs to be evaluated**: We need to identify the TTPs that occur after the initial access but before the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials.

3. **Credential Access (A)**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which could be necessary for the subsequent steps. However, it is not the first step after initial access but rather a step that might be required for further actions.

4. **Exfiltration (B)**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to an external location. Given that the question mentions email extraction from the MS Exchange Server, this could be a step that occurs after gaining access and before the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.

5. **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools. While this could be a step in the overall campaign, it is not directly related to the specific actions mentioned in the question.

6. **Discovery (D)**: This tactic involves the attacker learning about the network and systems to better understand the environment and identify potential targets. This could be a step that occurs after initial access but before the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible step that occurs after initial access (using Trojan.Cozer via phishing emails) but before the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server is likely to be the discovery of the network and systems. This would help the attackers understand the environment and identify valuable targets for further exploitation.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
