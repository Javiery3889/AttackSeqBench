To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Duke group used Seaduke to retrieve bot/system information, update configurations, and securely delete malware from victim systems using the 'seppuku' function, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and match them with the appropriate ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Seaduke to Retrieve Bot/System Information**: This action is related to gathering data from the victim's system, which aligns with the **Collection** tactic.
2. **Update Configurations**: This action involves modifying the system or malware to adapt to new conditions or to avoid detection, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
3. **Securely Delete Malware**: This action involves removing evidence of the malware to avoid detection, which also aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

Given these steps, the sequence of TTPs described involves actions that are primarily focused on gathering information and then evading detection by removing evidence. However, the question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

- **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining perishable channels with the target to facilitate the delivery of payloads, exfiltration of data, or remote control of victim systems. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the actions described.
- **B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the victim's system. Since the question asks what happened after the collection and deletion, this is not the most appropriate choice.
- **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid or reduce the detection of the adversary's actions. The actions of updating configurations and securely deleting malware are directly related to this tactic.
- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the victim's system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the actions described.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Duke group used Seaduke to retrieve bot/system information, update configurations, and securely delete malware is **Defense Evasion**.

Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
