Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where threat actors have already moved laterally using credentials obtained via Mimikatz and have executed commands on other systems.
   - The next step in the sequence is maintaining interaction with the compromised server and executing further commands.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial actions (lateral movement and command execution) are already described.
   - The next phase involves maintaining a persistent interaction with the compromised server and executing further commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the creation and management of resources to support the adversary's objectives. It does not fit the context of maintaining interaction and executing commands.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to gain access to new systems. The question already states that lateral movement has occurred, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary's first step to gain a foothold in the network. Since the threat actors have already moved laterally and executed commands, this is not the next step.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary's methods for directing and controlling compromised systems. Maintaining interaction with the compromised server and executing further commands aligns with this tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Command and Control.

Final Answer: D
