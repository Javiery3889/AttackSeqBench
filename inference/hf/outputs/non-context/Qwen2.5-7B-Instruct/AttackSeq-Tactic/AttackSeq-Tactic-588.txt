Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to execute their malicious payload.
   - They then evaded detection by masquerading their backdoor connections as SSL connections.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This typically involves the attackers moving data out of the network. The question does not mention any data being exfiltrated, so this is unlikely.
   - **B: Discovery** - This involves the attackers identifying and gathering information about the target environment. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This is the tactic where the attackers first gain access to the target network. Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to execute a payload is a form of initial access.
   - **D: Execution** - This involves the attackers running the code or payload on the target system. Exploiting the zero-day vulnerability and executing the malicious payload falls under this category.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question states that the attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities and then executed the malicious payload. This aligns with the "Execution" TTP.
   - After execution, the attackers then evaded detection by masquerading their backdoor connections as SSL connections. This action would fall under the "Evasion" TTP, which is not listed in the answer choices.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is from "Initial Access" to "Execution."

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
