To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies.**
   - This action is likely part of the **Collection** tactic, as it involves stealing or manipulating data (session keys and cookies) that can be used to gain unauthorized access or maintain access to the victim's webmail account.

2. **Intercepted HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.**
   - This action is also part of the **Collection** tactic, as it involves intercepting data (login credentials) to steal sensitive information.

Given the sequence, the TTPs described (manipulating session keys and cookies, and intercepting POST requests) are both part of the **Collection** tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the interception of HTTPS POST requests.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that help the adversary avoid being detected or hinder the defender's efforts. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods an adversary uses to initially infiltrate a network or system. The question does not provide any information that suggests this is the initial step.
- **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data and information from the target. The manipulation of session keys and cookies, as well as the interception of POST requests, are both part of the **Collection** tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** the interception of POST requests.

Since the manipulation of session keys and cookies is a preparatory step for the interception of POST requests, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
