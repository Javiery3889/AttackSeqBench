Let's analyze the question and the sequence of TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Initial Discovery Phase:**
   - The question mentions that the attackers first discovered the Domain Controller and performed domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`. This aligns with the `Discovery` tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where the attackers gather information about the network and its components.

2. **Execution of BADHATCH Deployment Script:**
   - The next step described is the use of `wmic.exe` to execute the BADHATCH deployment script on the Domain Controller. This action is more about deploying malware or a payload, which is typically associated with the `Execution` tactic. However, the specific action of deploying a script on a critical system like a Domain Controller is often a precursor to further actions that can lead to privilege escalation or lateral movement.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This is the initial phase but not the next step after the deployment of the script.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. Deploying a script on a Domain Controller could be a step towards gaining access to other systems, but it is not the immediate next step.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. Deploying a script on a Domain Controller could be a step towards gaining higher privileges, but it is not the immediate next step.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the compromised system. While deploying a script could lead to data collection, the immediate next step after deploying the script is more likely to be an attempt to gain higher privileges or move laterally.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible next step after deploying the script on the Domain Controller would be to attempt to gain higher privileges, which aligns with the `Privilege Escalation` tactic.

Final Answer: C: Privilege Escalation
