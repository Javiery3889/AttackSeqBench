Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - The adversary used PsLogList to export Security Event logs. This is a discovery tactic.
   - The adversary then collected data from various sources like SharePoint Online, email mailboxes, and network file shares. This is data collection.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. The question does not mention any initial access, so this is unlikely.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target network or system. While this could be a step after initial access, it is not directly related to the sequence of discovery and data collection.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary learning about the target environment. The use of PsLogList to export Security Event logs is a clear example of discovery.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves the adversary moving from one part of the network to another. While this could be a step after discovery, the question does not mention moving to different parts of the network.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with discovery (using PsLogList) and then proceeds to data collection. The most logical step between discovery and data collection is likely to be the exploitation of the discovered information to gather data.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from Discovery to Data Collection.

**Final Answer: C**
