Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack started with the injection of malicious code into a dynamic library of 3CX software. This is a form of initial access.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**: The next step is to ensure the continued functionality of the malicious code. The question states that this is done by abusing a legitimate 3CX software component, which aligns with the Persistence tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code or scripts. While the injection of malicious code into a dynamic library could be considered part of execution, the question is more focused on ensuring the continued functionality of the malicious code.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary finding and identifying information on the network or system. This does not align with the next step of ensuring continued functionality.
   - **C: Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target system. Abusing a legitimate software component to ensure the malicious code continues to function is a clear example of persistence.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing resources to support the attack. This does not align with the next step of ensuring continued functionality.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial access through the injection of malicious code, the next step is to ensure its continued functionality, which aligns with the Persistence tactic.

Final Answer: C: Persistence
