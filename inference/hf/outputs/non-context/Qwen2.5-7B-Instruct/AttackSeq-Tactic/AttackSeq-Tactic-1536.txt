To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network**: This indicates reconnaissance and network exploration.
2. **Compromising additional endpoints**: This suggests the attacker has gained initial access and is expanding their foothold within the network.
3. **Lateral movement efforts to compromise numerous workstations**: This indicates the attacker is moving from one compromised endpoint to others to find and exfiltrate critical information.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker developing and maintaining access to the target network. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it doesn't directly align with the specific steps of mapping the network and compromising additional endpoints.

B. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the attacker avoiding or bypassing security controls. While this could be a part of the overall strategy, it doesn't directly align with the specific steps of mapping the network and compromising additional endpoints.

C. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This could be a part of the overall strategy, but it doesn't directly align with the specific steps of mapping the network and compromising additional endpoints.

D. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. This directly aligns with the step of mapping the organization's internal network and compromising additional endpoints. Discovery helps the attacker understand the network topology and identify potential targets for lateral movement.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible tactic that precedes the lateral movement efforts is **Discovery**.

Final Answer: D
