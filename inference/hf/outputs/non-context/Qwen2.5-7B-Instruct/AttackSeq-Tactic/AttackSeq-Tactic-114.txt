To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Charming Kitten gained initial access to victims' accounts using spear-phishing emails and SMS messages, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. In this case, the adversary used spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gain initial access to victims' accounts.

2. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying resources and information within the target's network. Discovery would occur after initial access has been achieved.

3. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target's network or system over time. Persistence would also occur after initial access has been achieved.

4. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and preparing resources for an attack. Resource development would be a preparatory step before any actual attack takes place.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible tactic that would occur before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages is the development of the resources needed for the attack. This includes crafting the spear-phishing emails, setting up the SMS messages, and possibly developing the malware or tools used in the attack.

Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred before Charming Kitten gained initial access is **Resource Development**.

Final Answer: D: Resource Development
