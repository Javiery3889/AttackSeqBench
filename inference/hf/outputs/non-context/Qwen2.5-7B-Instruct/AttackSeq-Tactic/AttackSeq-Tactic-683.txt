Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions "establishing persistence by installing Explosive with service names under different file paths." This indicates the use of a persistence mechanism.
   - It also mentions "leverage keylogging to gain administrator passwords on target servers." This indicates the use of a keylogging technique to steal credentials.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to the attacker. While keylogging can lead to data exfiltration, the question does not specifically mention the transfer of data, so this is less likely.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or interference by defensive measures. While persistence and keylogging can be used to evade detection, the question does not specifically mention evading detection, so this is less likely.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the keylogging to gain administrator passwords. Keylogging is a method to directly access credentials.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan further attacks. While reconnaissance might be a precursor to the described actions, the question does not mention any initial reconnaissance activities, so this is less likely.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Credential Access, as it directly aligns with the keylogging to gain administrator passwords.

Final Answer: C
