Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the Bankshot implant was executed by downloading and running a DLL implant from a malicious domain.
   - It then states that the implant began evading detection by wiping files and content from the targeted system.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions described (downloading and running a DLL, then evading detection).
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves stealing credentials. Similar to privilege escalation, it is a common step but not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. The question clearly states that the Bankshot implant was executed by downloading and running a DLL implant. This is the first step in the sequence.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. The question mentions that the implant began evading detection by wiping files and content, which is a step that typically follows persistence. However, persistence is not the immediate step after execution.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Downloading and running the DLL (Execution) -> Evading detection by wiping files (Persistence).

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Execution followed by Persistence.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
