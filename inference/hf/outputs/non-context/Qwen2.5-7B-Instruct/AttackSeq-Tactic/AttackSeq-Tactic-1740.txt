To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each step:

1. **PowerShell Script Installation**: This action is part of the Execution Tactic, where the attackers use a script to install a payload (LightNeuron) on the compromised system.

2. **LightNeuron Execution**: After the installation, LightNeuron is executed to perform its functions.

3. **System Network Configuration Determination**: The functions `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` are used to gather information about the system's network configuration, which is a form of reconnaissance.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Execution**: This refers to the act of running the script and installing LightNeuron. It does not directly address the reconnaissance phase where network configuration is determined.

- **B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While the functions `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` are used to collect information, the term "Collection" is not the most precise fit for the specific action of determining network configurations.

- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the network and systems within the network. The use of `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` is a form of discovery as it helps the attackers understand the network environment.

- **D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While the information gathered might be used for privilege escalation, the specific actions described (determining network configurations) are more closely aligned with the Discovery Tactic.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most precise and relevant tactic for determining system network configurations using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` is Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
