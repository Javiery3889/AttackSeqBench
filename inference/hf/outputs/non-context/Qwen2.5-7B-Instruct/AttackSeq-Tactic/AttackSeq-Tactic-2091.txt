Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The question mentions that the APT actors gained initial access through malicious emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158. This is the first step in the attack sequence.

2. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running code on the target system. The MSIL/Crimson downloader is mentioned as attempting to download the full RAT component, which is an execution step.

3. **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand and identify the target. While reconnaissance can occur at various stages, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence provided.

4. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the adversary taking steps to avoid being detected or investigated. Again, while this can occur at various stages, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence provided.

Given the sequence described in the question, the APT actors first gained initial access, and then the MSIL/Crimson downloader was used to download the full RAT component. The step that logically occurs between gaining initial access and executing the MSIL/Crimson downloader is reconnaissance. The actors would likely gather information about the network and systems to better understand how to proceed with the download and execution of the RAT component.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
