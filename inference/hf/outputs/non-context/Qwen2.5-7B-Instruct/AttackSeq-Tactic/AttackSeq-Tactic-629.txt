To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before TG-3279 used a port scanning tool and an RDP brute force tool, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Port Scanning**: This is a method used to identify open ports and services on a target system. It is a common step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack, where the attacker gathers information about the target's network and services.

2. **RDP Brute Force**: This is a method used to gain unauthorized access to a system by attempting to guess the credentials. This is typically part of the exploitation phase, where the attacker tries to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.

Given these TTPs, we need to identify which tactic logically precedes these actions. 

- **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan further attacks. Port scanning is a key part of this process, as it helps the attacker understand the target's network and services.
- **Discovery (B)**: This tactic involves identifying users, systems, and network devices. While this can be part of the overall attack, it is more specific and comes after the initial gathering of information.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves developing tools and resources to be used in the attack. This is not directly related to the immediate actions of port scanning and RDP brute force.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures. This is not directly related to the immediate actions of port scanning and RDP brute force.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most logical ATT&CK tactic that precedes the use of a port scanning tool and an RDP brute force tool is **Reconnaissance**.

Final Answer: A
