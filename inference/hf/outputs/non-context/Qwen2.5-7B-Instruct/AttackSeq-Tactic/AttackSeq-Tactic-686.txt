Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that attackers used initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.
   - This indicates that the attackers have already gained initial access to the network and are now spreading laterally.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is "Initial Access" (gaining entry to the network).
   - The next step is using the initially infected servers as a pivot, which is a form of lateral movement.
   - The final step is spreading manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan, which is a method of lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This is the first step, not the step that occurs after using the initially infected servers as a pivot.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This is the most plausible sequence of TTPs as it follows the pivot and manual spread across the network.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This is not directly related to the spread across the network using the Explosive Trojan.
   - **D: Execution** - This is a step that might occur after the spread, but it is not the immediate next step after the pivot and spread.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers first gain initial access to the network.
   - They then use the initially infected servers as a pivot, which is a form of lateral movement.
   - Finally, they spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan, which is also a form of lateral movement.

Final Answer: B
