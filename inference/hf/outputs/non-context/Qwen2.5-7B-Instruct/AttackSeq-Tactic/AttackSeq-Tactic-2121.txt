To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Evading Security Measures**: The question mentions that adversaries used techniques like `ZwWriteVirtualMemory` and `ZwCreateSection` to manipulate memory and processes. These are techniques often associated with the `Execution` tactic, as they are used to run malicious code or modify existing processes.

2. **Establishing Command and Control**: The question states that the adversaries established command and control by transmitting data over HTTP and HTTPS protocols. This is directly associated with the `Command and Control` tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Given this sequence, we need to identify the tactic that occurs after `Execution` and before `Command and Control`.

- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. While it is a crucial step, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence of actions described.
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying the target and its systems. Again, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence.
- **Command and Control**: This is the tactic that follows the establishment of a communication channel, which is mentioned in the question.
- **Execution**: This is the tactic that involves running malicious code or modifying processes, which is mentioned in the question.

The sequence described in the question is:
- Evading security measures (Execution)
- Establishing command and control (Command and Control)

The tactic that logically fits between these two is `Discovery`, as it involves identifying and understanding the target environment, which is a necessary step before establishing command and control.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
