Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that adversaries gathered information through social engineering techniques and supply chain vulnerabilities.
   - This is followed by gaining access through exploiting unprotected MongoDB databases and compromised Citrix systems.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target to plan and execute an attack. The question states that adversaries gathered information through social engineering and supply chain vulnerabilities, which aligns with the definition of reconnaissance.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The question mentions gaining access through exploiting MongoDB databases and Citrix systems, which fits this category.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the adversary developing the resources needed for the attack, such as tools and malware. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the gathering of information through social engineering and supply chain vulnerabilities.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target's network or system over time. This typically occurs after initial access has been achieved.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with gathering information (Reconnaissance) and then moving to gaining access (Initial Access).

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from gathering information to gaining access.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
