To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial use of a website disguised as a fundraising service to deliver a malicious app, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's system or network. The scenario describes a website disguised as a fundraising service delivering a malicious app, which is a method of initial access.

2. **Defense Evasion (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary evading or bypassing the target's security controls. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the delivery of the malicious app.

3. **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing a means of communication with the compromised system to control it. After gaining access, the next logical step would be to establish a means of communication to maintain control over the compromised system.

4. **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining the resources needed to conduct the attack. This is a broader term and not directly related to the specific action of delivering a malicious app.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that would follow the initial access is establishing a means of communication to maintain control over the compromised system.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The adversary used a website to deliver a malicious app, which is an Initial Access.
2. After gaining access, the next step would be to ensure the compromised system remains under the adversary's control, which is best described by the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
