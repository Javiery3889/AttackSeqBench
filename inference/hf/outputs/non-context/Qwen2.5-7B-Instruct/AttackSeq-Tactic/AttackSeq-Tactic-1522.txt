Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Whitefly used stolen credentials for lateral movement across the network to expand their control.
   - This indicates that the attackers have already stolen credentials and are now using these credentials to move laterally within the network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is:
     1. Credential theft (implied by "stolen credentials")
     2. Lateral movement (using the stolen credentials)

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic is not directly related to the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement. It involves developing tools or resources, which is not the next step after lateral movement.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - While this could be a tactic used during the attack, it is not the immediate next step after lateral movement.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This is the current step in the sequence, as the attackers are using stolen credentials to move laterally.
   - **D: Collection** - This involves gathering data or information from the network. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after lateral movement.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Credential theft -> Lateral movement.
   - The next logical step after lateral movement would be to use the gained access to collect information or data from the network.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Although Collection (D) is a plausible next step, the immediate next step after lateral movement is typically the exploitation of the new access to gather information.
   - However, based on the options provided and the direct sequence of TTPs, the most plausible next step after lateral movement is Collection.

Final Answer: D: Collection
