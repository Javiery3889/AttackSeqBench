Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - Downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet from GitHub for executable commands.
     - Retrieving the username and computer name.
     - Exfiltration of data through uploading files to file.io and posting download links to a Slack channel.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the exfiltration of data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves the adversary identifying assets and information within the target network. The actions of downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet and retrieving the username and computer name are clearly discovery activities.
   - **Exfiltration (B):** This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target network. The question asks what happened before the exfiltration, so this cannot be the correct answer.
   - **Resource Development (A):** This tactic involves the adversary developing tools, resources, or infrastructure to be used in the attack. The actions described do not align with resource development.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing means of communication with compromised systems. While this might occur after discovery, the question specifically asks about the tactic that happened before the exfiltration.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The actions of downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet and retrieving the username and computer name are clearly discovery activities.
   - These discovery activities would logically precede the exfiltration of data, as the adversary needs to understand the environment and identify valuable data to steal.
   - Exfiltration (B) and Command and Control (D) are more likely to occur after the discovery phase, not before.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
