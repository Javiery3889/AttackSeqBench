Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Process Hollowing:** Dexphot loaded executables into system processes.
   - **Security Evasion:** Multiple layers of security evasion such as fileless techniques and obfuscated batch scripts.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Impact:** This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data exfiltration, destruction, or disruption. It typically occurs after the attacker has established a foothold and is ready to execute the desired malicious actions. This does not fit the sequence as it comes after the security evasion.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. While it is a crucial step, it is not directly related to the process of loading executables into system processes or employing security evasion techniques.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. While it is a significant part of an attack, it is more about ensuring the attacker can return to the system rather than the immediate steps after loading executables.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and techniques. Given that the question mentions "multiple layers of security evasion such as fileless techniques and obfuscated batch scripts," this is the most relevant tactic. It directly follows the step of loading executables into system processes and precedes the step of employing security evasion techniques.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question logically fits into the "Defense Evasion" tactic, as it is the step that follows the loading of executables and precedes the use of security evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
