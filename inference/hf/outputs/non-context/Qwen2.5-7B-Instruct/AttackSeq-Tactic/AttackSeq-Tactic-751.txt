Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Gamaredon exfiltrated harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - It also states that the malware used both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This refers to the act of transferring data from a compromised system to an external location. The question states that exfiltration occurred after the malware used HTTP/HTTPS for communication, which implies that the malware had already established a connection with the C&C server before exfiltrating the documents.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This refers to the act of moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems. The question does not mention any movement between systems, so this is unlikely.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This refers to the process of establishing and maintaining control over a compromised system. The use of HTTP/HTTPS for communication with the C&C server is a form of Command and Control activity. However, the question specifies that this occurred after the malware had already established the connection, not before.
   - **D: Persistence** - This refers to the act of maintaining access to a system over time. While persistence could be a step before establishing C&C communication, the question does not specifically mention persistence as a prerequisite for the communication.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the malware first established a connection with the C&C server using HTTP/HTTPS, and then exfiltrated the harvested documents.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware first established a C&C connection, and then exfiltrated the documents.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
