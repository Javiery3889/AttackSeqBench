To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the ProjectM campaign's actions, let's break down the sequence of TTPs and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Conceal Infrastructure Using WHOIS Protection Services and Linked Domains**: This TTP is directly related to the tactic of **Defense Evasion**. The campaign is trying to hide its infrastructure to avoid detection, which is a common method used in **Defense Evasion**.

2. **Delivery of Additional Payloads Like Andromeda**: After concealing the infrastructure, the next step is to deliver the payload. This action is closely related to the tactic of **Command and Control**. The payload (Andromeda in this case) is typically used to establish a connection back to the attacker's infrastructure, which is a form of C2.

3. **Impact**: This tactic is more about the consequences of the attack, such as data exfiltration, data modification, or other malicious actions. While it is a critical part of the attack lifecycle, it is not the immediate next step after delivering the payload.

4. **Resource Development**: This tactic is about the attacker's efforts to develop and maintain their capabilities, which is not directly related to the immediate actions following the delivery of the payload.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurs after concealing infrastructure and delivering a payload is **Command and Control**.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
