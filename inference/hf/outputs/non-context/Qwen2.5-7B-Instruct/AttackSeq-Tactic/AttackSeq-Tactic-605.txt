To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **FIN4 transmitted stolen credentials along with campaign codes to its infrastructure.**
   - This action involves the theft of credentials and the transmission of data, which aligns with the "Credential Access" and "Exfiltration" tactics.

2. **Servers used for transmission included junomaat81[.]us and lifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com.**
   - The use of servers for transmission indicates a method of Command and Control (C2) where the attackers can communicate with their infrastructure.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the victim's network to an external location. While the question mentions the transmission of stolen credentials, the primary focus is on the method of transmission rather than the act of exfiltration itself.

B. **Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attackers establishing and maintaining the interaction with the compromised system. The use of servers for transmission aligns with this tactic, as these servers are likely used for C2 communications.

C. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the theft of sensitive information, such as credentials. The question mentions the theft of credentials, which aligns with this tactic.

D. **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the initial scouting of the target to gather information. The question does not mention any initial reconnaissance activities.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible next step after the theft and transmission of credentials would be the establishment of a method to maintain control over the compromised system, which is best described by the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: B**
