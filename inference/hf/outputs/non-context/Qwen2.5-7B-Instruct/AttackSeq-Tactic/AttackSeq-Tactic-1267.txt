Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs starts with "TG1021 gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks."
   - The next step is "achieved persistence by utilizing web shells and a custom malware framework operating in-memory."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - Persistence: Utilizing web shells and a custom malware framework operating in-memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution** - This typically refers to the execution of a payload or command. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly describe the steps leading to persistence after initial access.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This involves stealing credentials, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence of TTPs provided.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This involves gathering information to better understand the target. While reconnaissance might have occurred before the initial access, it is not explicitly mentioned in the sequence.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This is the first step in the attack lifecycle, which is explicitly mentioned in the sequence as the exploitation of internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the initial access was achieved by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - After gaining initial access, the next step is achieving persistence.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the sequence (exploitation and persistence) are directly related to the "Initial Access" and "Persistence" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is "Initial Access" followed by "Persistence."
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: Initial Access.

Final Answer: D: Initial Access
