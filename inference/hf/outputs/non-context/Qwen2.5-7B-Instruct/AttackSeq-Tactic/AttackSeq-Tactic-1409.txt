To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate each step:

1. **Supply Chain Attack**: The scenario starts with a trojanized version of the 3CX software being distributed. This indicates that the initial method of gaining access to the target environment is through a supply chain attack, which is a form of Initial Access.

2. **Infiltration of macOS Systems**: Once the trojanized software is installed, it allows the Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems. This step involves the execution of the malware and its subsequent actions within the target environment.

3. **Next Steps**: After the malware is executed, the next logical steps would be to discover the environment, access credentials, and potentially execute further actions to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary learning about the target's environment, which would logically occur after the malware is executed and has some level of control over the system.
- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials, which would also likely occur after the malware has gained some level of control and is exploring the system.
- **C: Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code, which aligns with the step where the Smooth Operator malware is executed after the trojanized software is installed.
- **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment, which has already occurred with the supply chain attack.

Given the sequence of events, the most logical next step after the malware is executed would be to discover the environment and access credentials, as these actions would follow the execution of the malware.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
