Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Executing a batch file.
     - Installing the main payload.
     - Gaining elevated privileges by bypassing User Access Control (UAC).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying useful information about the target environment. It does not fit the sequence as it comes after the malware has already installed and gained privileges.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code. While the batch file execution is part of this, the question specifies that the batch file installed the main payload, which is a step beyond simple execution.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the adversary developing and preparing resources for the attack. It does not fit the sequence as it is not a tactic that occurs after the malware has been installed and privileges have been gained.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining higher-level access to the system. The question explicitly mentions that the malware gained elevated privileges by bypassing UAC, which is a clear indication of privilege escalation.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves executing a batch file, installing the main payload, and then gaining elevated privileges.
   - The step of gaining elevated privileges (bypassing UAC) is a clear example of the Privilege Escalation tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack described in the question is the Privilege Escalation tactic.

**Final Answer: D**
