To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Harvester deployed a custom backdoor and tools such as a custom downloader and screenshot tool to execute commands and facilitate remote access.**
   - This indicates that the attackers have already gained initial access and are now establishing a foothold within the network. They are deploying tools to maintain control and gather information.

2. **They attempted to blend malicious activities within legitimate network traffic using CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure.**
   - This suggests that the attackers are trying to evade detection by making their activities appear as normal network traffic.

Given this sequence, we need to identify which ATT&CK tactic best fits the step between gaining initial access and blending activities within legitimate traffic.

- **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through the network to other systems. While it is a common step after gaining initial access, the question does not specifically mention moving to other systems, but rather blending activities.
- **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from the network. While data exfiltration is a common goal, the question does not mention the theft of data, but rather the blending of activities.
- **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the network. Deploying a backdoor and tools to execute commands and facilitate remote access aligns well with the persistence tactic.
- **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. While this is part of the process, it is more of a means to an end rather than a separate tactic in the sequence.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible next step after deploying tools for remote access and before blending activities is maintaining that access, which is best described by the Persistence tactic.

**Final Answer: C**
