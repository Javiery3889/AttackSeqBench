Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the NewPass agent established communication with the command-and-control (C2) server.
   - It also states that the agent used a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems. The question already mentions that the agent has established communication with the C2 server, so this step has already occurred.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target's systems. The use of a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests suggests that data is being sent to the C2 server, which is a common step in exfiltration.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying resources and information on the target network. While this could be a preceding step, the question does not indicate that the agent is currently discovering resources.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information or data from the target. While this could also be a preceding step, the question does not indicate that the agent is currently collecting data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the agent already communicating with the C2 server and using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests. This strongly suggests that the data is being sent to the C2 server, which is a typical step in the exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
