Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions Turla malware, which is known for its sophisticated attack techniques.
   - The specific TTPs mentioned are:
     - Defense evasion through avoiding detection (e.g., using netstat).
     - Maintaining stealth without requiring elevated privileges.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is not directly related to the described TTPs of avoiding detection and maintaining stealth.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing a means for an attacker to control a compromised system. While it is a common post-exploitation tactic, the question does not provide information that directly links to C2.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection or analysis by defenders. The question explicitly mentions that the malware avoids detection and maintains stealth, which aligns perfectly with this tactic.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. While it is a prerequisite for many attacks, the question does not specifically mention execution as the next step after the described TTPs.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes TTPs related to avoiding detection and maintaining stealth.
   - These TTPs are directly aligned with the Defense Evasion tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The next logical step after evading detection and maintaining stealth would be to continue the attack without being detected, which is best described by the Defense Evasion tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
