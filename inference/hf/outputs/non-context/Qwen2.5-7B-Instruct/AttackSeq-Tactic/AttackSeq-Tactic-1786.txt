To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Elise malware moved its payload to a specific directory and executed it by injecting into Internet Explorer, let's analyze the sequence of actions and match them with the appropriate ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Elise malware moved its payload to the \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ directory.**
   - This action is related to the malware's persistence mechanism, as it ensures the payload remains in a location that is less likely to be cleaned by antivirus software or user actions.

2. **The malware executed the DLL by injecting it into Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe).**
   - This action is a method of running the payload and maintaining a foothold on the system, which is a form of persistence and also a way to evade detection by running in a legitimate process.

Given these actions, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the victim, their environment, and resources. While discovery could occur before or during the execution phase, it is not directly related to the actions described.

B. **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels for command and control. While the malware might use C2 to exfiltrate data or receive further instructions, the actions described are more about persistence and execution.

C. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary ensuring that their access to the target system is maintained over time. Moving the payload to a directory like \AppData\Roaming\ and injecting it into a legitimate process like Internet Explorer are clear methods of persistence.

D. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the adversary avoiding detection or analysis by the defender. While this is a common goal, the actions described are more about ensuring the malware remains active and operational.

Given the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described actions is Persistence, as it directly addresses the methods used to ensure the malware remains active and operational on the system.

Final Answer: C
