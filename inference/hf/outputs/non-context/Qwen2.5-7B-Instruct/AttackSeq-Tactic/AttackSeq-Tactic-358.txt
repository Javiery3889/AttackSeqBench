Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor established communication with the C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to transfer the collected data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign used a backdoor (SombRAT) to establish communication with C2 servers.
   - The communication was done using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, which is a method to hide the malicious traffic within legitimate traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker developing or modifying tools, resources, or infrastructure. While the SombRAT backdoor is a tool, the question is specifically about the transfer of collected data, not the development of the tool.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems. While the communication with C2 servers is part of C2, the question is about the transfer of data, not the maintenance of access.
   - **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the attacker transferring data from the target's system to the attacker's system. The question mentions the transfer of collected data, which aligns with the definition of exfiltration.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves the attacker moving from one system to another within the target network. The question does not mention moving to other systems but rather transferring data from the compromised system to the attacker.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for transferring the collected data is Exfiltration.

Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
