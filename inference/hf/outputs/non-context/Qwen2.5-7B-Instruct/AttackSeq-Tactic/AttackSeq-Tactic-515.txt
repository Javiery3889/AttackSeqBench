Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack began with malicious documents containing macros that injected the Sharpshooter downloader into Word's memory. This is an example of the "Initial Access" tactic.

2. **Execution**: The Sharpshooter downloader is then executed in memory, which aligns with the "Execution" tactic.

3. **Persistence**: The question states that persistence was ensured by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder. This is a clear example of the "Persistence" tactic.

4. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. There is no mention of moving to other systems in the question, so this does not fit the sequence.

5. **Impact**: This tactic involves the actual damage or desired outcome of the attack. While the download to the startup folder could be seen as a step towards impact, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before persistence.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Initial Access (through malicious documents)
- Execution (of the Sharpshooter downloader)
- Persistence (ensured by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder)

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before persistence is "Execution."

Final Answer: B: Execution
