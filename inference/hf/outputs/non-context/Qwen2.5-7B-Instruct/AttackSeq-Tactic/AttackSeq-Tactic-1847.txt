Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that BlueDelta conducted discovery activities by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to gather system and network information.
   - This is followed by the automation of exfiltration of victim's Roundcube session cookie and database information.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining perishable channels with one or more targets to deliver commands or steal data. The exfiltration of session cookies and database information is more closely related to data exfiltration rather than establishing a command and control channel.
   - **B: Collection**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information and assets to be used in the attack. The question states that BlueDelta gathered system and network information, which aligns with the Collection tactic.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker developing and maintaining the resources needed to conduct the attack. While this could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the specific actions described in the question.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the attacker avoiding or obscuring their presence or actions on the network. This is not directly related to the described actions of gathering information and exfiltrating data.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (discovery and gathering of information) aligns most closely with the Collection tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
