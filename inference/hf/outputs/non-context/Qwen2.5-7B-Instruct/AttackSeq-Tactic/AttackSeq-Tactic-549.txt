Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes UNC1151's initial access through spear phishing campaigns.
   - The next step in the sequence is the use of spoofed websites to steal victim credentials.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Gaining entry into the target network through spear phishing.
   - Credential Access: Stealing victim credentials using spoofed websites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**: This refers to the process of transferring data from the target system to the attacker. It does not align with the next step of stealing credentials.
   - **B: Credential Access**: This directly aligns with the next step of stealing victim credentials via spoofed websites.
   - **C: Discovery**: This involves the attacker learning about the network and systems. It does not directly relate to stealing credentials.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This is the first step and does not align with the next step of stealing credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that after gaining initial access, the next step is to steal credentials via spoofed websites.
   - Among the given options, only "Credential Access" (B) directly corresponds to the act of stealing credentials.

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
