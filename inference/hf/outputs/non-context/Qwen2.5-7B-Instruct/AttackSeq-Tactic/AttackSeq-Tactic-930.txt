Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attacker decrypted obfuscated registry content using an AES256 Decryptor.
   - The attacker deployed the njRAT remote access tool.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While the use of an AES256 Decryptor could be considered a form of defense evasion, it is not the immediate next step after deploying a remote access tool.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to communicate with the compromised system. Deploying a remote access tool like njRAT is a common method for establishing command and control over the compromised system.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker developing or modifying tools, techniques, and procedures. While the use of an AES256 Decryptor could be part of resource development, it is not the immediate next step after deploying a remote access tool.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods used to initially gain access to the target environment. Deploying a remote access tool is typically a step that occurs after initial access, not immediately after.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The decryption of obfuscated registry content using an AES256 Decryptor is a method to evade detection and ensure the persistence of the malware. This is a form of defense evasion.
   - The deployment of the njRAT remote access tool is a method to establish a persistent and controlled access to the compromised system. This is a form of command and control.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question logically leads to the establishment of command and control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
