Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that SOCKSBOT implant ensured persistence by creating a Windows service named 'Check for updates' set to 'delay-auto' start.
   - It also mentions that SOCKSBOT reflectively loaded itself to spoof legitimate services with similar names.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While creating a Windows service and spoofing legitimate services can be considered evasion techniques, the question specifically asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after these actions.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining channels for control over the compromised system. The actions described (creating a service and spoofing legitimate services) are more about ensuring the implant remains undetected and operational rather than directly establishing a command and control channel.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves techniques used to maintain long-term access to a network or system. The creation of a Windows service and the reflective loading of the implant to spoof legitimate services are directly related to ensuring the implant remains active and undetected over time.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. The actions described do not indicate any movement to other systems but rather focus on ensuring the implant remains active on the current system.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The actions described (creating a Windows service and spoofing legitimate services) are directly related to ensuring the implant remains active and undetected over time, which aligns with the Persistence tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
