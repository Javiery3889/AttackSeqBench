Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Execution of an obfuscated VBScript named 'PlayList.vbs' using 'wscript.exe'.
     2. Communication with the C2 server.
     3. Deletion of the VBS script to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (A):** This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. It does not directly relate to the deletion of the script to evade detection.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by the defender. Deleting the VBS script to evade detection is a clear example of defense evasion.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic is about moving from one system to another. It does not fit the context of deleting a script to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access (D):** This tactic involves stealing credentials. It does not fit the context of deleting a script to evade detection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attacker deletes the VBS script after execution to avoid detection. This action is a direct form of defense evasion, as it is a technique used to avoid being detected by the defender.
   - None of the other tactics (Persistence, Lateral Movement, or Credential Access) involve the specific action of deleting a script to evade detection.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
