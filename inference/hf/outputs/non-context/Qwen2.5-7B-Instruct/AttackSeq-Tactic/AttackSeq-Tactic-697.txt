To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Defense Evasion**: The question mentions that the attackers used defense evasion techniques, including deleting files and disabling security tools. This is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Gathering Credentials**: The question states that Sednit gathered information about credentials using dumpers to target browser databases and email clients. This is a specific action that falls under the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access** - This directly describes the action of gathering credentials, which is the final step mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection** - While this could be a broader term that includes gathering credentials, it is not as specific as "Credential Access" and does not directly describe the action of using dumpers to target browser databases and email clients.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development** - This tactic is about developing tools, resources, or infrastructure, which does not align with the specific action of gathering credentials.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and systems, which is a step that could occur before gathering credentials but is not as specific as "Credential Access."

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers first used defense evasion techniques, then gathered credentials using dumpers to target browser databases and email clients. The tactic that best describes the action of gathering credentials is "Credential Access."

**Final Answer: A**
