Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Derusbi gathers host information and transfers it back via network beacons.**
     - This indicates that the malware is collecting information from the host and sending it to a remote server.
   - **It binds to a random source port and communicates with the preconfigured destination port 443.**
     - This suggests that the malware is establishing a connection to a server using a common HTTPS port (443), which is often used for legitimate traffic and can help evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. The description of the malware binding to a random source port and communicating with a preconfigured destination port 443 aligns well with the C2 tactic, as it involves establishing a connection to a remote server for control.
   - **B: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While the malware is indeed collecting information, the question focuses more on the communication aspect rather than the collection itself.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. The question does not mention any actions that would elevate the privileges of the malware.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves the attacker learning information about the target environment. The question describes the malware sending collected information, not discovering new information.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware is gathering information (collection) and then sending it to a remote server (command and control).
   - The use of a random source port and a preconfigured destination port 443 is a common technique in C2 communications to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
