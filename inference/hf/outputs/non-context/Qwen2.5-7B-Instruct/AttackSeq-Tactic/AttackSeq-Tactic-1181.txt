To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before APT28 identified vulnerable systems by reporting scanning results to a centralized server following their IP range scans, let's analyze the sequence of actions step-by-step.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. This could be through phishing, exploiting a vulnerability, or other means. This is a prerequisite for any further actions, including scanning for vulnerable systems.

2. **Discovery**: After gaining access, the adversary would likely discover the network and systems within it. This could involve scanning IP ranges to identify open ports, services, and potentially vulnerable systems.

3. **Collection**: Once the adversary has identified vulnerable systems, they would likely collect information from these systems, which could include credentials, files, or other data.

4. **Reporting**: The final step mentioned in the question is the reporting of scanning results to a centralized server. This is an action that would occur after the adversary has discovered and possibly collected information from the identified vulnerable systems.

Given this sequence, the most logical step that would occur before the adversary identifies vulnerable systems and reports the results is the initial access to the network and subsequent discovery of the systems.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- **Initial Access** (to gain entry to the network)
- **Discovery** (to find vulnerable systems)

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C: Initial Access
