To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with the MSIL/Crimson downloader.
   - The downloader successfully downloads a full Remote Access Tool (RAT) from a specified host.
   - The RAT then communicates with its servers using a custom TCP protocol.

2. **Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves establishing a long-term presence on the target network. While the RAT might be used to maintain persistence, the question specifically mentions communication with servers, which is more indicative of a different tactic.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the theft of data from the target network. The communication with servers could potentially be for data exfiltration, but the question does not mention any data being stolen or transferred.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The description of the RAT communicating with its servers using a custom TCP protocol aligns perfectly with the C2 tactic.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. The execution of the RAT has already occurred, as the question states that the RAT has been downloaded and is now communicating.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The MSIL/Crimson downloader is used to download the RAT, which is a form of execution.
   - The RAT then communicates with its servers, which is a clear indication of Command and Control (C2) activity.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that follows the execution of the RAT is Command and Control (C2).

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
