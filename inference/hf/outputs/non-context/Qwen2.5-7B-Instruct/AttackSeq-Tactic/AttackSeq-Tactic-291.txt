Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     - Vyveva's backdoor encrypts C&C traffic.
     - Vyveva's backdoor communicates with C&C via Tor.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next after these actions, specifically when stolen data was sent to the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (T1048)** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While the backdoor and C&C communication are part of this tactic, the question is specifically about the action of sending stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **B: Discovery (T1040)** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying information about the victim's network and systems. This does not fit the context of sending stolen data.
   - **C: Exfiltration (T1040)** - This tactic involves the attacker transferring data from the victim's network to the attacker's location. This aligns with the action of sending stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **D: Reconnaissance (T1005)** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's network and systems. This does not fit the context of sending stolen data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The backdoor and C&C communication are part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - The next logical step after establishing C&C communication would be to transfer the stolen data to the C&C server, which is the definition of the Exfiltration tactic.
   - Discovery and Reconnaissance do not fit the context of the question as they are not directly related to the transfer of stolen data.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
