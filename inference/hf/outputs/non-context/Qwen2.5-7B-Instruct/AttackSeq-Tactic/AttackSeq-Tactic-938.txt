Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Initial TTP**: The question mentions that Tropic Trooper exploited CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to execute commands and install an MSI package on the system. This indicates that the initial compromise and execution of malicious code have already occurred.

2. **Understand the Sequence**: The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the execution of the exploit. The exploit itself is a form of initial access, but the question is asking about what happens next.

3. **Evaluate Each Option**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This is the initial compromise of the system, which has already happened with the exploitation of the vulnerability.
   - **B: Execution**: This is the act of running the malicious code, which is also mentioned as having already occurred.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This involves obtaining credentials, which is a step that could follow the execution of the exploit to gain deeper access.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This is about developing and maintaining access, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle.

4. **Determine the Next Logical Step**: After the initial access and execution of the exploit, the next logical step would be to use the gained access to obtain credentials or other sensitive information to maintain and expand the foothold on the system.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be moving from execution to credential access.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
