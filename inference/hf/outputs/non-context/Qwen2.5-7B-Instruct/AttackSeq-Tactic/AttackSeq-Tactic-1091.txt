Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The question mentions that the Iron group gained access through deploying a previously unknown backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code. This clearly indicates the Initial Access tactic.

2. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system. The question states that the Iron group used a backdoor, which is a form of malicious code, to gain access. However, the backdoor is not yet executed; it is just deployed. Therefore, this does not fit the sequence as the next step.

3. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. The question does not mention any data being stolen or exfiltrated at this point. Therefore, this does not fit the sequence as the next step.

4. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing credentials from the target system. The question does not mention any credential theft at this point. Therefore, this does not fit the sequence as the next step.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the Iron group has already gained access (Initial Access) and deployed a backdoor. The next step in the sequence would be to execute the backdoor to gain further control or access.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
