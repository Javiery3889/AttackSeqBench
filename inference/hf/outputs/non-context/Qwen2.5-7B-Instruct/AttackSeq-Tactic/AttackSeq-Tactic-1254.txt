Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The Fox Kitten Campaign conducted reconnaissance activities.
   - They used their campaign infrastructure to target companies globally.
   - They gained access to the networks by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network. The question states that the campaign gained access by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services, which fits this tactic.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand the target. The question mentions that the campaign conducted reconnaissance activities, which fits this tactic.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the adversary developing tools, resources, and infrastructure to support the campaign. While this could be part of the campaign, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence of events.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves the adversary collecting data from the target. While this is a part of the campaign, it is not mentioned as occurring after reconnaissance and before gaining access.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Reconnaissance -> Initial Access.
   - Reconnaissance (B) is the first step, and Initial Access (A) is the step that follows it.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
