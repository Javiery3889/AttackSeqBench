Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware gathers victim system information such as username, computer name, network connections, and running processes. This is a form of reconnaissance and is part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The malware then enables HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding. This is a method of establishing a covert channel or command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic is about developing and maintaining the infrastructure for an attack, which does not align with the described actions.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying the network and systems, which is what the malware is doing initially. However, it does not cover the establishment of the C2 channel.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running the malware or other code on the target system. While the malware is running, this does not specifically cover the establishment of the C2 channel.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the means to direct the compromised system. Enabling HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding is a method to establish a covert C2 channel, which fits this tactic.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware first gathers information (Discovery).
   - Then, it establishes a covert C2 channel (Command and Control) by enabling HTTPS communication with specific encryption and encoding methods.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
