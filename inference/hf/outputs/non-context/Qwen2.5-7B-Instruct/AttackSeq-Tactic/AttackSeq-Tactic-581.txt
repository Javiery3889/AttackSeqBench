To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Higaisa APT group used the JavaScript file to execute 'cmd /c ipconfig' to retrieve IP address information, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the context of the operation.

1. **Understanding the TTP**: The Higaisa APT group used a JavaScript file to execute a command that retrieves IP address information. This suggests that the group is gathering information about the network environment, which is a common tactic in the early stages of an attack to understand the target's network layout and potentially identify vulnerable systems.

2. **Evaluating the TTPs**:
   - **Defense Evasion (T1027)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or interference from defensive measures. While this could be a tactic used later in the attack, it is not directly related to the retrieval of IP address information.
   - **Impact (T1486)**: This tactic involves actions that directly damage or disrupt the target's systems or data. The retrieval of IP address information is not an impact action but rather a reconnaissance step.
   - **Resource Development (T1560)**: This tactic involves the development of tools, resources, or infrastructure to support the attack. While this could be part of the overall operation, it is not directly related to the retrieval of IP address information.
   - **Discovery (T1082)**: This tactic involves gathering information to understand the target's network, systems, and users. Retrieving IP address information is a clear example of discovery, as it helps the attackers understand the network topology and potentially identify systems to target.

3. **Conclusion**: The retrieval of IP address information is a clear example of the Discovery tactic, as it is a step in understanding the target's network environment. This would logically occur before the execution of the command to gather this information.

Final Answer: D: Discovery
