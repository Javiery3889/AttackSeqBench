Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the Pierogi backdoor collected system information during the Discovery phase.
   - It then states that the backdoor utilized its capabilities to take screenshots and execute arbitrary commands.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The backdoor first performed Discovery (collected system information).
   - Subsequently, it performed actions that are more aligned with the Collection and Command and Control tactics.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker controlling the compromised system. Taking screenshots and executing arbitrary commands are actions that fall under this category.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker learning information about the target environment. While the backdoor did perform Discovery, the question is asking about the next phase after Discovery.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves the attacker developing tools and resources. Taking screenshots and executing commands are not typically considered resource development.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering data from the target. While taking screenshots can be considered a form of data collection, the execution of arbitrary commands is more aligned with Command and Control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor first performed Discovery (collected system information).
   - After Discovery, the backdoor took screenshots and executed arbitrary commands, which are actions more aligned with Command and Control.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Command and Control.

Final Answer: A: Command and Control
