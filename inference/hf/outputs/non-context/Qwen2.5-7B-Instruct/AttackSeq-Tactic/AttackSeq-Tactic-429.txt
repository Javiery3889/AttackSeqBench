Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used tools like Medusa and Fast SYN Scanner to enumerate services, fingerprint SMTP servers, and authenticate on VNC and RDP ports.
   - These actions are indicative of reconnaissance activities, as they involve gathering information about the target's network and systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the actor gaining access to the target network or system. The actions described (enumerating services, fingerprinting, and authenticating) are not directly related to gaining initial access but rather to understanding the target environment.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the actor establishing channels to exfiltrate data or send commands to the compromised system. The actions described do not align with establishing command and control channels.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the actor gathering information to better understand the target environment. The actions described (enumerating services, fingerprinting, and authenticating) are directly related to gathering information about the target's network and systems.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the actor identifying and classifying resources and services on the network. While the actions described are related to identifying services, the term "discovery" is more specific to the identification of resources and services, which is a subset of the broader reconnaissance process.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The actions described (enumerating services, fingerprinting SMTP servers, and authenticating on VNC and RDP ports) are all part of the process of gathering information about the target environment. This aligns most closely with the Reconnaissance tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - While Discovery is a part of Reconnaissance, the broader scope of the actions described (including enumeration and authentication) fits better under the Reconnaissance tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
