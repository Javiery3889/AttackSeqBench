To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the rshell backdoor collected OS information and transmitted it to the C&C server, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the provided answer choices.

1. **Iron Tiger's rshell backdoor collected OS information and transmitted it to their C&C server.**
   - This action is related to the "Command and Control" (T1071) tactic, as it involves the backdoor transmitting data to a command and control server.

2. **Continuing to receive and execute commands.**
   - This action is also part of the "Command and Control" (T1071) tactic, as it involves the backdoor receiving instructions from the C&C server and executing them.

Given the sequence of actions described, the next logical step would be to determine what the backdoor does with the information it has collected and the commands it receives. The backdoor would likely use this information to further its objectives, such as moving laterally within the network or discovering more information about the system.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding defensive measures, which does not directly follow the collection and execution of commands.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the same network, which could be a next step after collecting information and receiving commands.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems, which could be a next step after collecting OS information.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic is already covered by the initial actions of the backdoor.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor has already collected OS information and transmitted it to the C&C server.
   - It is continuing to receive and execute commands.
   - The next logical step would be to use the collected information to further the attack, which could involve discovering more information about the network or moving to other systems.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible ATT&CK tactic that follows the described sequence is "Discovery" (T1018), as it involves gathering more information about the network and systems, which is a natural progression after collecting OS information and receiving commands.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
