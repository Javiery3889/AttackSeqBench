To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs step-by-step.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. This is a prerequisite for any further actions, including deploying a dropper executable.

2. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system. Deploying a dropper executable via DLL sideloading is a form of execution.

3. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. This typically occurs after the adversary has established a foothold and has collected data of interest.

4. **Collection**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target system, which could be used to further their objectives, such as deploying malware.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most logical order is:
- **Initial Access** (to gain entry)
- **Collection** (to gather information)
- **Execution** (to deploy the dropper executable)

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the deployment of the dropper executable via DLL sideloading is **Collection**.

Final Answer: B: Collection
