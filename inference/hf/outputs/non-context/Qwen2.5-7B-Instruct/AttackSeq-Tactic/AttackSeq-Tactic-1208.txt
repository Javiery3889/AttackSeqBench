Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Compromising legitimate websites.
     - Delivering a malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
   - The question asks which MITRE ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred involving the use of a JavaScript-based framework to masquerade as a software update.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand their target. While reconnaissance could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly involve the use of a JavaScript-based framework to masquerade as a software update.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying resources and assets that are of value to the adversary within the target network. Discovery is also not directly related to the use of a JavaScript-based framework to masquerade as a software update.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves the adversary taking action to alter the system state or cause a direct effect on the target. While this could be part of the attack, it does not specifically address the use of a JavaScript-based framework to masquerade as a software update.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary initially gaining access to the target environment. The question mentions "gaining Initial Access through compromised legitimate websites and delivering a malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update." This directly aligns with the use of a JavaScript-based framework to masquerade as a software update, which is a common method for initial access.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the adversary uses a JavaScript-based framework to deliver a malicious payload disguised as a software update. This is a method of gaining Initial Access to a target environment.
   - The other tactics (Reconnaissance, Discovery, and Impact) do not specifically address the method of delivering the malicious payload through a JavaScript-based framework.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: D**
