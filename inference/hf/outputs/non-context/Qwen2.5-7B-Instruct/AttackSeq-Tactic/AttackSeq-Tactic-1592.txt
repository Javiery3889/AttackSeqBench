Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the deployment of Industroyer2 using the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol to disrupt operations at electrical stations and substations.
   - It then mentions the execution of wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described includes the deployment of Industroyer2 and the execution of wipers. The wipers are likely used to erase evidence or clean up after the malware execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the cleanup or evidence erasure mentioned in the question.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. The question already mentions the execution of Industroyer2 and wipers, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves the actual effect of the malware, such as data destruction or system disruption. The question already describes the disruption caused by Industroyer2, so this is not the next step.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker discovering information about the target environment. Given that the malware has already been deployed and executed, and wipers have been used to clean up, the next step would likely be to check if the malware has been successful and to ensure no evidence remains. This aligns with the concept of discovery, as the attacker would want to verify the impact and ensure no traces of the attack remain.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves deploying Industroyer2 and executing wipers.
   - The next logical step would be to verify the impact and ensure no evidence remains, which aligns with the "Discovery" tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the execution of wipers is the "Discovery" tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
