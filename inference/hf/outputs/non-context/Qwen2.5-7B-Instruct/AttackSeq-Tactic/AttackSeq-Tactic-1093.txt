Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware determined the presence of 360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security.
   - Based on this detection, the malware chose its installation method.
   - The group then used dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target system. While it's possible that the malware might collect data, the question specifically mentions the malware determining the presence of security software and choosing its installation method, which is more related to detection and response rather than data collection.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. The question does not mention the malware establishing a long-term presence or maintaining access, so this is less likely.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying resources and services on the target network. The malware determining the presence of security software and choosing its installation method aligns closely with the adversary discovering the presence of specific security software.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by the defender. The question mentions the malware using dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection, which fits this tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this step.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The malware first determines the presence of security software (Discovery).
   - Based on this detection, it chooses its installation method.
   - Then, it uses techniques to avoid detection (Defense Evasion).

Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the malware used dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques is Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
