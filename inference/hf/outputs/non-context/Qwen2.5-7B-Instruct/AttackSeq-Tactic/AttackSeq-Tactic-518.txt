Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Rising Sun implant first performs initial reconnaissance and then establishes communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests. We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic best fits the establishment of this communication channel.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining perishable channels with a target to deliver commands, exfiltrate data, or maintain persistence. The use of encrypted HTTP POST requests to communicate with control servers aligns perfectly with this tactic.
- **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining resources to support the attack lifecycle. This does not directly relate to the communication channel established.
- **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying information to be used in subsequent phases of the attack. While reconnaissance is part of discovery, the question specifically mentions the establishment of communication, which is more aligned with C2.
- **D: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining higher-level access privileges on a system. This is not related to the communication channel established.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial reconnaissance (T1012) is a precursor to establishing the communication channel.
- The use of encrypted HTTP POST requests to communicate with control servers is a clear indication of Command and Control (T1071).
- The other options do not fit the context of the question as well as Command and Control does.

Final Answer: A: Command and Control
