Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the attacker has already gathered system-related details and browser history.
   - The next step is the theft of credentials from applications like MS Outlook and Mail.ru Agent.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attacker has already performed reconnaissance (gathering system-related details and browser history).
   - The next step is to steal credentials, which is a form of credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying useful information about the target environment. While it is a part of the attacker's process, it is not the immediate next step after gathering system-related details and browser history.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. It is not directly related to the immediate next step of stealing credentials.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target to better understand the environment. The question already states that the attacker has performed reconnaissance, so this is not the next step.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves the actual use of stolen credentials to perform actions or cause damage. Stealing credentials from applications like MS Outlook and Mail.ru Agent is a form of impact, as the attacker can use these credentials to perform actions or gain further access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is that the attacker has already performed reconnaissance and is now using the stolen credentials to perform actions or cause damage.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: Impact.

Final Answer: D
