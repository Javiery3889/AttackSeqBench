Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that APT42 conducted reconnaissance by engaging in social engineering efforts to gather information on targets.
   - It then states that APT42 gained initial access through spear phishing and credential harvesting techniques.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described is: Reconnaissance (social engineering) -> Initial Access (spear phishing and credential harvesting).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. While it is related to gathering information, it is more specific than the broad term "reconnaissance" used in the question.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target. While it is related to the information gathering phase, it is more specific than "reconnaissance."
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves identifying the network and systems to be targeted. It aligns well with the initial social engineering efforts to gather information.
   - **D: Resource Development** - This tactic involves developing the resources needed for the attack. It is more about preparing the attack rather than the initial gathering of information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question explicitly mentions "reconnaissance" as the first step, which is a broad term for gathering information.
   - "Discovery" and "Collection" are more specific tactics that fall under the broader category of "reconnaissance."
   - "Resource Development" is not directly related to the initial gathering of information but rather to the preparation of the attack.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is "Reconnaissance."

Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
