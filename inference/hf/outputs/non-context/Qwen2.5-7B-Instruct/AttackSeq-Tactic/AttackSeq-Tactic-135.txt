Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The question mentions "FamousSparrow" engaging in "Resource Development" by exploiting known remote code execution vulnerabilities to acquire infrastructure such as domains and servers.

2. **Understand the Sequence:**
   - "Resource Development" is a phase where the attacker acquires and prepares the necessary resources for their operations.
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities to acquire domains and servers is a specific action that falls under the broader category of "Resource Development."

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution** - This refers to the stage where the attacker runs the payload or malicious code. While this is a critical step, it typically comes after the attacker has established a foothold or control over the infrastructure.
   - **B: Impact** - This refers to the consequences of the attack, such as data exfiltration, data modification, or other malicious actions. This is also a later stage and not directly related to the acquisition of infrastructure.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This refers to the first step where the attacker gains a foothold in the target environment, such as through phishing, exploiting a vulnerability, or other means. This is the earliest stage and does not align with the acquisition of infrastructure.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This refers to the process of gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack. While reconnaissance is an early step, it does not directly align with the acquisition of infrastructure through exploitation.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question describes the acquisition of infrastructure, which is a step that logically follows the initial access and reconnaissance phases but precedes the execution and impact phases.

Given the context and the options provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access** 

This is because the acquisition of infrastructure through exploiting vulnerabilities is a step that logically follows the initial access phase, where the attacker gains a foothold, and precedes the execution and impact phases.
