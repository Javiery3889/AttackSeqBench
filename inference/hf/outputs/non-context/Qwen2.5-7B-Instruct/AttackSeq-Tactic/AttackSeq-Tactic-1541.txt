Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already collected and prepared valuable documents related to internal applications and procedures. This indicates that the attackers have already gained some level of access and have been able to gather information.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred as the final step in this attack sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (A):** This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources and systems that are of value to the adversary. Since the attackers have already collected and prepared documents, this step has likely already occurred.
   - **Exfiltration (B):** This tactic involves the attacker transferring data from the target network to the attacker-controlled system. Given that the attackers have valuable documents, the next logical step would be to transfer these documents to their own systems.
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. Since the attackers have already collected and prepared documents, this step has likely already occurred.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves the adversary establishing means of communication with compromised systems. While this is a critical step, it is not the final step in the context of the question, as the attackers have already collected and prepared the documents.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already gained access and collected valuable documents.
   - The next logical step would be to transfer these documents to their own systems to ensure they can use the information without being detected on the target network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible final step in this attack sequence is the transfer of the collected data, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
