Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign utilized process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
   - These actions were performed through the SombRAT backdoor.
   - The gathered information was then archived using a custom storage file format.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. The question does not mention the initial access but rather actions taken after gaining access.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target system. The question describes the process of gathering information (discovery of processes, system information, and system time) and archiving it, which aligns with the Collection tactic.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the adversary developing tools, resources, or infrastructure to support the attack. While the SombRAT backdoor is a tool, the question focuses on the actions taken after gaining access, not the development of the tool.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary learning information about the target environment. The question mentions process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery, which are all part of the Discovery tactic. However, the question also mentions archiving the information, which is more aligned with the Collection tactic.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that involve gathering information (discovery) and then storing that information (collection). The Discovery tactic covers the initial gathering of information, but the question emphasizes the archiving of the information, which is more closely aligned with the Collection tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
