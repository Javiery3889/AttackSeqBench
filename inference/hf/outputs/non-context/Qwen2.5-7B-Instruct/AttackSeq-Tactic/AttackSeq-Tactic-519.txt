Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Rising Sun implant has already established communication with control servers through HTTP POST requests.
   - The next step involves sending encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The Rising Sun implant has already set up a communication channel (Command and Control).
   - The next logical step would be to use this established channel to send data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the transfer of data from a victim's system to an external location. Given that the data is being sent to control servers, this fits the description of exfiltration.
   - **B: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker developing and maintaining access to the target network. This does not directly align with the action of sending data.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the means to direct the compromised system. Since the communication channel is already established, this is not the next step.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves the attacker running code on the victim's system. This does not align with the action of sending data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Exfiltration, as it involves sending data to external control servers.

Final Answer: A: Exfiltration
