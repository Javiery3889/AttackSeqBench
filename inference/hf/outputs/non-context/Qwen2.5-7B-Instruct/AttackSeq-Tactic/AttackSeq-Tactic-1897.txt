Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs Mentioned in the Question:**
   - The sequence starts with the deployment of `InstallUtil.exe` for defense evasion.
   - Then, the malicious payload is injected into memory.
   - The question asks about the next tactic based on the payload's communication pattern with an attacker-controlled server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing a channel to control the compromised system. The communication pattern with an attacker-controlled server is a clear indicator of Command and Control activity.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While it could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions communication with a server, which is more indicative of C2.
   - **C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. The communication with a server could be for exfiltration, but the question does not mention any data being stolen or transferred.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by the defender. While defense evasion could be part of the overall attack, the communication with a server is more indicative of C2.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The deployment of `InstallUtil.exe` and the injection of the payload into memory are likely part of the initial compromise and persistence.
   - The communication with an attacker-controlled server is a clear sign of the attacker establishing a channel to control the compromised system, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
