To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks using exploited external servers and deployed web shells as a gateway, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The question mentions that FIN13 used exploited external servers to establish a foothold, which is a clear example of Initial Access.

2. **Establishing Foothold**: Once the initial access is achieved, the next step is to establish a foothold. This is the process of maintaining control over the compromised system, which is what FIN13 did by deploying web shells.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. While reconnaissance could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the specific actions of establishing a foothold using exploited external servers and deploying web shells.

- **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid being detected or investigated. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the specific actions of establishing a foothold.

- **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This is a step that occurs after the foothold is established, not before.

- **D: Initial Access**: This tactic directly aligns with the actions described in the question. The use of exploited external servers to gain access to the network is a clear example of Initial Access.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred before FIN13 established a foothold is Initial Access.

Final Answer: D
