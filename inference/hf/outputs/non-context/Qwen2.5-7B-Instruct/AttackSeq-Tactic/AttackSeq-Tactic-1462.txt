To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware, let's analyze the sequence of events and the corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the threat actors gaining access to the target's network or system. In the scenario, the threat actors likely used a method to deliver weaponized MS Office documents to the targeted employees, which would enable the initial access to the workstations.

2. **Execution**: This tactic involves the threat actors running the malware on the targeted systems. The question states that the BlackEnergy 3 malware was executed on the workstations after the employees enabled macros in the weaponized documents.

3. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the threat actors ensuring their access to the target system is maintained over time. While persistence is a critical aspect of the overall attack, it is not the first step in the sequence described.

4. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the threat actors taking steps to avoid detection or removal by security tools. This is a tactic that could be used at various points in the attack, but it is not the initial step.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the execution of the BlackEnergy 3 malware is the initial access, which involves the threat actors delivering the weaponized MS Office documents to the targeted employees.

Final Answer: B: Initial Access
