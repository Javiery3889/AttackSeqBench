To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after APT10 used dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and PSCP for interconnected command and control infrastructure, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the context provided.

1. **Dynamic-DNS Domains**: This indicates that the attackers are using domain names that can be changed dynamically to maintain persistence and avoid detection. This is a common tactic in maintaining command and control (C2) infrastructure.

2. **Robocopy and PSCP**: These tools are used for file copying and secure file transfer, respectively. This suggests that the attackers are moving data or files, which is a key activity in the collection of information.

3. **Interconnected C2 Infrastructure**: This implies that the attackers have established a network of systems to communicate with their C2 servers, which is a tactic used in maintaining persistence and ensuring that they can control and exfiltrate data from the target network.

Given these TTPs, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to collect the data that has been transferred or moved using these tools. The ATT&CK tactic that best fits this description is "Collection," which involves gathering and storing data for later use.

Let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Command and Control**: This tactic is more about maintaining the ability to control the target system, which has already been established with the use of dynamic-DNS domains and the C2 infrastructure.

B. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to the file transfer and data collection activities described.

C. **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering and storing data, which aligns with the use of Robocopy and PSCP for file transfer and the need to maintain the data for later use.

D. **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources, which is typically done before the data collection phase.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described TTPs is "Collection."

Final Answer: C
