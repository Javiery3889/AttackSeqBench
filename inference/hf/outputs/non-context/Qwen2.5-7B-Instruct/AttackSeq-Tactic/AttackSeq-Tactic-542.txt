Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the threat actor gaining access to the target's network or system. In the scenario, the threat actor delivered a macro-enabled XLS file via a phishing email. This action is a form of initial access, as it is the first step in the attack where the threat actor gains a foothold.

2. **Execution**: This tactic involves the threat actor running code or a script on the target's system. The question mentions that a VB macro within the XLS file executed a malicious Windows Installer object to download the MSI package. This is clearly an execution step, as the macro is running code to download the package.

3. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the threat actor obtaining credentials from the target system. There is no mention of the threat actor obtaining credentials in the given scenario, so this is not relevant to the sequence of TTPs described.

4. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves the threat actor moving from the initial point of compromise to other parts of the network. There is no mention of the threat actor moving to other systems or networks in the given scenario, so this is also not relevant to the sequence of TTPs described.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is:

- **Initial Access**: The threat actor delivers a macro-enabled XLS file via a phishing email.
- **Execution**: The VB macro within the XLS file executes a malicious Windows Installer object to download the MSI package.

The tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access and before the execution is **Execution**.

Final Answer: B
