To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Darkhotel APT gained initial access, let's analyze the sequence of events and the corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand the target environment. In the context of the Darkhotel APT, the initial step would likely involve reconnaissance to identify potential targets, such as hotel guests who might be using popular software that could be exploited.

2. **Credential Access (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or networks. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the initial action that leads to gaining access.

3. **Collection (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary collecting data from the compromised systems. This is a step that occurs after gaining access, not before.

4. **Resource Development (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary developing tools and resources to support their operations. While this is a preparatory step, it is not directly related to the initial access phase.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that would occur before the Darkhotel APT gains initial access is reconnaissance. The adversary would need to gather information about potential targets and their software usage patterns to craft a targeted attack.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
