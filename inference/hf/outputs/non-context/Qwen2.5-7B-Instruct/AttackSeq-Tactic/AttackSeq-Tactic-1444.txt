Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Preparing compromised web servers to host the ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
     2. Resource development (implying the creation or preparation of the malicious payload).
     3. Tricking users into executing the malicious DLL through DLL Hijacking.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining access to the target's network or system. The preparation of compromised web servers and resource development do not directly align with gaining initial access.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The question mentions tricking users into executing the malicious DLL, which is a form of execution.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While the malicious DLL might be used to collect data, the question does not specifically mention data collection as the next step.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources on the target network. The preparation of compromised web servers and resource development do not directly align with discovering resources.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The preparation of compromised web servers and resource development are preparatory steps.
   - The next step in the sequence is tricking users into executing the malicious DLL, which is a form of execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs and the options provided, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the preparation of compromised web servers and resource development, and before tricking users into executing the malicious DLL, is Execution.

Final Answer: B: Execution
