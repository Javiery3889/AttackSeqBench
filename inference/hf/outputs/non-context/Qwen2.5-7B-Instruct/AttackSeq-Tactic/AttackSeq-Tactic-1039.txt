To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the establishment of mechanisms for maintaining long-term access on infected systems, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions macOS threats like ChromeLoader and Operation In(ter)ception.
   - These threats established mechanisms such as Chrome extensions or LaunchAgents for maintaining long-term access on infected systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The establishment of mechanisms for maintaining long-term access indicates that the attackers have already gained initial access to the systems and are now focusing on ensuring their persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying useful information about the target environment. While this could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to maintaining long-term access.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. The question already states that initial access has been established, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target environment over a long period. The question mentions maintaining long-term access, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running code or commands on the target system. While this is part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to the maintenance of long-term access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that mechanisms for maintaining long-term access have been established.
   - The next logical step in the attack lifecycle, after establishing mechanisms for long-term access, is to ensure that these mechanisms are functioning and continue to provide the adversary with access to the system.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the establishment of mechanisms for maintaining long-term access is Persistence.

Final Answer: C: Persistence
