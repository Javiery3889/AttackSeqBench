To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Compressing proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR**: This step involves data preparation and is a precursor to data exfiltration.
2. **Uploading files to a Dropbox account using cURL**: This step involves transferring the data to a remote location, which is a form of exfiltration.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before APT10 utilized custom malware for transferring the data out of the environment. The custom malware is the tool used for exfiltration, and the steps described (compressing and uploading) are preparatory actions.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing tools, resources, and infrastructure to support the attack. While this could be part of the overall APT lifecycle, it is not directly related to the preparatory actions described in the question.

B. **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used in the attack. While reconnaissance is a common initial step, it is not directly related to the preparatory actions of compressing and uploading data.

C. **Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the command and control (C2) infrastructure. This is more related to the infrastructure used for communication post-exfiltration rather than the preparatory actions.

D. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data from the target to the attacker. The preparatory actions (compressing and uploading) are part of the exfiltration process, even though the custom malware is the tool used for the actual exfiltration.

Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the use of custom malware for exfiltration is the preparatory actions themselves, which align with the exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: D**
