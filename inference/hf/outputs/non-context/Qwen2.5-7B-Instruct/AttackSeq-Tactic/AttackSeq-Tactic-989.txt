Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The question mentions that ShadowPad was executed via DLL hijacking in a legitimate application, which is a method of initial access. However, the question asks what happened after this initial access.

2. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target network. While ShadowPad's execution via DLL hijacking could be a method to establish persistence, the question specifies that this happened before the stealing of domain authentication credentials.

3. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing credentials. The question explicitly states that the attackers stole domain authentication credentials to propagate further within the network. This is the action that occurs after the initial execution of ShadowPad.

4. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running code on the target system. The execution of ShadowPad via DLL hijacking is mentioned as the initial action, so this cannot be the answer as it happened before the credential theft.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Initial Access (via DLL hijacking)
- Execution (of ShadowPad)
- Credential Access (stealing domain authentication credentials)

Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic that occurs after the execution of ShadowPad and before the credential theft.

Final Answer: C: Credential Access
