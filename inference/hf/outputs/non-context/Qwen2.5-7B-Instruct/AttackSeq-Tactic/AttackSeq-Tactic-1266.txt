To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **TG1021 used deserialization attacks to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers.**
   - This step involves an initial access to the target system, which is typically categorized under the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **The next step is the execution of sophisticated memory-resident malware on the target systems.**
   - This step involves the execution of malware, which is categorized under the "Execution" tactic.

Given the sequence of events, the TTP that most likely occurred after "Initial Access" and before "Execution" is "Privilege Escalation." This is because after gaining initial access and before executing malware, the attackers would likely need to escalate their privileges to ensure they can fully control the system and execute their payload.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Initial Access** - This is the first step, not the step that occurs after initial access.
- **B: Privilege Escalation** - This is the step that logically follows initial access and precedes execution.
- **C: Execution** - This is the step that occurs after privilege escalation.
- **D: Persistence** - This tactic is about maintaining access over time, which is not the immediate next step after initial access and before execution.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Initial Access (TG1021 used deserialization attacks to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers) - This is the first step.
2. Privilege Escalation (likely to occur next to gain higher privileges) - This is the step that fits between initial access and execution.
3. Execution (sophisticated memory-resident malware is executed) - This is the final step.

**Final Answer: B**
