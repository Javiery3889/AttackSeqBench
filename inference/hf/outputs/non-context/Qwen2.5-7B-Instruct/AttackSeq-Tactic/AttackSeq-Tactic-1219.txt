To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers leveraged the PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes, let's analyze each step:

1. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying assets and information within the target network. While discovery is crucial, it is not directly related to the execution of a specific malware like PoisonIvy or the dumping of password hashes.

2. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves the adversary moving from the initial point of compromise to other parts of the network. While this is a critical step, it is more about moving within the network rather than the initial steps leading to the execution of malware.

3. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system. The execution of PoisonIvy Trojan is a clear example of this tactic. However, the question asks what happened before this execution.

4. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining initial foothold in the target environment. This could be through phishing, exploiting a vulnerability, or other means. Once the initial access is established, the adversary can then proceed to execute malware like PoisonIvy.

Given the sequence of events, the most logical step before executing the PoisonIvy Trojan would be establishing initial access to the target system. This would allow the adversary to then proceed with further actions, including the execution of the Trojan and subsequent activities like dumping password hashes.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
