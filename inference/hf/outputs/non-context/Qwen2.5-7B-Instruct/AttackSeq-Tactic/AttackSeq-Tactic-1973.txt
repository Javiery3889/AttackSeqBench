To determine the most plausible next step in the attack sequence after establishing Command and Control (C2) using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, let's analyze the sequence and the options provided.

1. **Establishing Command and Control (C2)**: This is the initial step where the attacker sets up a method to communicate with the compromised system. Tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT are used for this purpose.

2. **Next Steps in the Attack Sequence**: After establishing C2, the attacker would likely move to the next phase of the attack, which typically involves gathering information or data from the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Command and Control**: This is the initial step and not the next step after C2 has already been established.
- **B: Collection**: This involves gathering information or data from the compromised system. This is a logical next step after establishing C2, as the attacker would need to collect data to understand the environment and possibly exfiltrate it.
- **C: Credential Access**: This involves stealing credentials, which is a step that could occur but is not necessarily the next step after establishing C2. It could be part of the collection phase but is not the most direct next step.
- **D: Exfiltration**: This involves moving the collected data out of the compromised system. While this is a critical step, it typically occurs after the data has been collected. Therefore, it is not the most likely next step after C2 has been established.

Given the sequence and the options provided, the most plausible next step after establishing Command and Control is Collection.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
