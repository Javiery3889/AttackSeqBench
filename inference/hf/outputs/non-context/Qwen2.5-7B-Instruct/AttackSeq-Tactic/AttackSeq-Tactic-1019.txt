To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the SBDH malware contacted a remote server to download its backdoor and data stealer components, we need to analyze the sequence of actions and identify the initial step that would precede the malware contacting a remote server.

1. **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining initial access to the target network or system. This is typically the first step in an attack and can be achieved through various means such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials. Once initial access is achieved, the malware can then establish a connection to a remote server to download additional components.

2. **Execution (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary executing code or programs on the target system. While this is a critical step, it usually follows the initial access. The malware would need to be executed after gaining initial access to the system.

3. **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing channels for controlling and communicating with the compromised system. This typically happens after the malware has been installed and is ready to receive further instructions or data.

4. **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary moving laterally within the network to other systems. This is also a step that occurs after initial access and execution, as the adversary needs to have a foothold on the network to move to other systems.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:

- **Initial Access (D)**: The adversary gains access to the target system.
- **Execution (A)**: The malware is executed on the system.
- **Command and Control (B)**: The malware contacts a remote server to download additional components and establish a channel for further communication.

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the SBDH malware contacted a remote server to download its backdoor and data stealer components is **Initial Access**.

Final Answer: D
