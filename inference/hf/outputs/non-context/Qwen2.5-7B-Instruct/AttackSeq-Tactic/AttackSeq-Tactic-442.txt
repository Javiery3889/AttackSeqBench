Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers delivered malware via a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'.
   - The malware then executed a polymorphic self-copied file from the %Temp% folder with a randomized name.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution** - This TTP involves the actual running of the malware. The question describes the malware executing a file from the %Temp% folder, which aligns with the Execution TTP.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This TTP involves the initial entry point into the target network or system. The question mentions the delivery of malware, which is a step that typically occurs during Initial Access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This TTP involves techniques used by the attackers to avoid detection or removal. While the polymorphic nature of the malware could be considered a form of Defense Evasion, the question does not specifically mention evasion techniques.
   - **D: Collection** - This TTP involves the gathering of data from the target system. The question does not mention any data collection activities.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with the delivery of malware (Initial Access) and then proceeds to the execution of the malware (Execution).

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from Initial Access to Execution.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
