To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step:

1. **Initial TTP**: Configuring the command-and-control infrastructure using a compromised router as a proxy server.
   - This indicates that the attackers have already established a means to communicate with their C2 servers through a compromised device, which is a form of Command and Control (T1090 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

2. **Next TTP**: The question asks for the final stage of the attack after this configuration.
   - Given the options, we need to consider what typically follows the establishment of a C2 infrastructure in an attack lifecycle.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. While this is a common step in many attacks, it typically occurs after the initial compromise and the establishment of a foothold, which is already implied by the C2 infrastructure setup.

B. **Command and Control**: This tactic is about maintaining and using the C2 infrastructure. Since the question states that the C2 infrastructure has already been configured, this is not the final stage but rather a continuous process.

C. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While this is a common step, it is usually part of the initial compromise or lateral movement phase, not the final stage.

D. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to an external location. This is often the final stage of an attack, where the attackers gather and send the stolen data to their C2 servers.

Given the sequence and the nature of the attack lifecycle, the most plausible final stage after configuring the C2 infrastructure would be the exfiltration of data.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
