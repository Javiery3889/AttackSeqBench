Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where "vba_macro.exe" is executed via the Shell command.
   - The goal is to ensure that the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The execution of "vba_macro.exe" is a method of initial access or delivery.
   - The objective is to ensure the BlackEnergy dropper runs at every system startup, which is a form of persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. While reconnaissance might be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the execution at every system startup.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems. It does not directly relate to ensuring execution at every system startup.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is important for the attacker to maintain control, it does not directly address the execution at every system startup.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. Ensuring that the BlackEnergy dropper runs at every system startup is a form of persistence, as it ensures the attacker can maintain control and access to the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup is Persistence.

Final Answer: D
