To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before SideCopy gained initial access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain involving HTAs and loader DLLs, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the context provided.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that SideCopy gained initial access through malicious LNK files. This is a specific method of gaining initial access, but it does not specify the tactic that led to this method.

2. **Infection Chain**: The infection chain involves HTAs and loader DLLs, which are methods used to execute malicious code. This suggests that the attackers had to first gain a foothold in the network or system and then use these techniques to spread the malware.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the initial access through malicious LNK files. This implies that the tactic should be one that precedes the initial access method.

4. **ATT&CK Tactic Analysis**:
   - **Lateral Movement (T1078)**: This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. It typically occurs after initial access and is used to spread the attack within the network.
   - **Credential Access (T1003)**: This tactic involves obtaining legitimate user credentials. It can be used to gain initial access but is not the most likely to precede the specific method of malicious LNK files.
   - **Resource Development (T1560)**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining the resources used in the attack. It is more about the preparation phase and not directly related to gaining initial access.
   - **Reconnaissance (T1005)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used in the attack. It is a common step that precedes gaining initial access, as attackers need to understand the target environment to craft a successful attack.

Given the context and the need to find the tactic that most likely occurred before the initial access through malicious LNK files, **Reconnaissance (T1005)** is the most plausible choice. Attackers would need to gather information about the target environment, including potential vulnerabilities and methods of initial access, before executing a specific attack like using malicious LNK files.

Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
