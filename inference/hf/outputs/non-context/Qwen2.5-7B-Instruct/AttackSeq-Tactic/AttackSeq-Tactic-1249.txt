Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that CozyDuke spread via email containing links to a compromised website or Dropbox. This indicates the initial method of gaining access to the system.
   - After the initial access, the CozyDuke main component is executed using `rundll32.exe`.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (T1071)**: This tactic involves the adversary communicating with the compromised system. While this could occur after the initial access, it is not the immediate step after the initial access.
   - **B: Exfiltration (T1040)**: This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the compromised system. This is not the immediate step after the initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access (T1210)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target system. The question states that CozyDuke spread via email, which is a method of initial access.
   - **D: Execution (T1059)**: This tactic involves the adversary running code on the target system. The question specifies that the CozyDuke main component is executed using `rundll32.exe`, which is the immediate step after the initial access.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is the first step in the attack sequence, which is achieved through the email containing links to a compromised website or Dropbox.
   - After the initial access, the next step is the execution of the CozyDuke main component.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access** is not the correct answer because it describes the first step, not the step after the initial access. The correct answer is **D: Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
