To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Taidoor malware exploited a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) through spear-phishing attachments.
   - The malware then dropped itself onto the target's system.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. It typically occurs after initial access and is not directly related to the initial steps of the attack.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan the attack. While reconnaissance could be part of the overall attack strategy, it is not directly linked to the specific TTP of exploiting a vulnerability through spear-phishing.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. The exploitation of a Microsoft Office vulnerability through spear-phishing attachments is a method of gaining initial access to the target system.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While persistence is a critical step in many attacks, it occurs after the initial access has been achieved.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the exploitation of a vulnerability through spear-phishing, which is a method of gaining initial access to the target system.
   - The TTPs listed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework for gaining initial access include the use of phishing, social engineering, and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - The sequence of events described in the question aligns most closely with the "Initial Access" tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: C: Initial Access
