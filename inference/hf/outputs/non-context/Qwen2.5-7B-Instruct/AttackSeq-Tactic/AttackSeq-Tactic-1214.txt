To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer, we need to understand the context and sequence of actions in the attack lifecycle.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions commands like whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer, which are used for gathering information on the network and profiling the system.
   - These actions fall under the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as they are used to identify and gather information about the network and systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attackers preparing resources for the attack, such as malware or tools. It does not directly relate to the specific commands mentioned.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which could be used to perform the commands mentioned, but it is not the initial step in the sequence.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While it is a step in the attack lifecycle, it typically follows the initial compromise and credential access.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and gathering information about the network and systems. The commands mentioned (whoami, net user, Get-NetComputer) are directly related to this tactic.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The commands whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer are used to gather information about the system and network, which is a core activity in the Discovery tactic.
   - Discovery is the first step in the sequence of actions that would lead to using these commands.
   - Resource Development, Credential Access, and Lateral Movement are subsequent steps that would logically follow Discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, where the Discovery tactic logically precedes the use of the mentioned commands, is the correct answer.

Final Answer: D: Discovery
