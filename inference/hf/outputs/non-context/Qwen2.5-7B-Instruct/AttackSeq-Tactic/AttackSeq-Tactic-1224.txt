To determine the most plausible next step in the attack sequence, let's analyze the given information and the options provided.

1. **PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan used for communication with C&C server**: This indicates the initial stage of establishing a foothold and maintaining communication with the attackers.
2. **Intellectual property copied to archives on internal systems**: This suggests that the attackers have gained access to valuable data and are preparing to move it.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Impact**: This tactic involves the use of malware to cause damage or disruption. While the copying of intellectual property could be seen as a form of impact, it is more of a preparatory step rather than a direct impact.

B. **Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network. While this could be a subsequent step, the question focuses on the completion of the attack, which typically involves the final actions to achieve the attacker's goals.

C. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target network to the attacker's location. Given that the intellectual property has been copied to archives, the next logical step would be to transfer this data out of the network.

D. **Command and Control**: This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised system. While this is a critical step, it is more about maintaining access rather than completing the attack.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible next step would be the transfer of the copied intellectual property to the attackers, which aligns with the exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
