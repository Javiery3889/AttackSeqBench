Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where DNSpionage gains initial access to a network via spear-phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The scenario involves a spear-phishing attack, which is a form of social engineering.
   - The spear-phishing emails are disguised as job postings, which suggests that the attackers likely gathered information about the target to make the emails more convincing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute an attack. In this scenario, the attackers would need to gather information about the target to make the spear-phishing emails more convincing.
   - **B: Resource Development** - This tactic involves developing the tools and resources needed for an attack. While this could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the initial phase of gaining access.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods and techniques used to initially gain access to a network. The scenario describes the initial access via spear-phishing, so this is the action that occurs after reconnaissance.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access within a network. This would occur after initial access has been gained, not before.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers would need to gather information about the target (Reconnaissance) before they could craft convincing spear-phishing emails.
   - The spear-phishing emails are then used to gain initial access to the network.
   - Privilege escalation would occur after initial access has been gained, which is not the focus of the question.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that Reconnaissance occurred before the initial access via spear-phishing.

Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
