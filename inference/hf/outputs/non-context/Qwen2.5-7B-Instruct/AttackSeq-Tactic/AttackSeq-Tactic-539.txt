Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Execution of the NewPass implant using a dropper.
     2. Decoding the binary file and extracting the agent component.
     3. Establishing communication with the C2 server using encrypted HTTP requests.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to decode the binary file and extract the agent component while avoiding detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. Decoding a binary file and extracting an agent component to avoid detection fits well within this category.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it might be part of the overall attack, it doesn't specifically address the decoding and extraction of the agent component.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the methods used to control the compromised system. Establishing communication with the C2 server is part of this, but it doesn't cover the decoding and extraction of the agent component.
   - **D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves stealing credentials. It doesn't align with the described TTP of decoding and extracting an agent component.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question focuses on the specific action of decoding the binary file and extracting the agent component, which is a method to avoid detection. This aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic, as it involves techniques to bypass security measures and remain undetected.
   - The other tactics (Collection, Command and Control, and Credential Access) do not directly address the specific action of decoding and extracting the agent component.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
