To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the options provided.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that 'versioninfo.bat' collected and prepared various information from the user's computer for sending to its destination. This indicates that the malware or attacker has already gathered data and is in the process of exfiltrating it.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves the attacker maintaining access to the compromised system over time. While this is a common tactic, it doesn't directly follow the action of collecting and preparing data for exfiltration.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the attacker sending stolen data from the victim's network to a remote location. Given that the question states the information is being prepared for sending to a destination, this is the most direct and logical next step.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means of control over the compromised system. While this is a critical step, it typically occurs before or during the data collection phase, not after.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources available on the network. This would likely occur before the data collection phase, not after.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already collected and prepared data.
   - The next logical step is to send this data to the attacker's location, which is the definition of exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
