Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attacker deployed Cobalt Strike on the network.
   - The attacker performed reconnaissance using a different infrastructure.
   - The attacker exfiltrated data using the SmartFTP Client.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target. While reconnaissance can be part of the collection process, the question specifically mentions reconnaissance as a separate step.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code or scripts. Deploying Cobalt Strike is an execution step.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining initial access to the target network. Deploying Cobalt Strike and performing reconnaissance are not typically part of the initial access phase.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system. Deploying Cobalt Strike and performing reconnaissance can be part of establishing command and control.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The attacker has already deployed Cobalt Strike (Execution) and performed reconnaissance (likely part of Collection or Reconnaissance).
   - The next step before exfiltrating data (which is part of the Lateral Movement or Exfiltration tactics) would be establishing a means to communicate with the compromised system, which is Command and Control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is Command and Control.

Final Answer: D
