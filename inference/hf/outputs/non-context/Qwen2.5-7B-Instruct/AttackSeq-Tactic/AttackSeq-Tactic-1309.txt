Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files to control KernelBot implants.
   - They directed these bots to target Next Media websites.
   - The result was a 'total failure' of their network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Establishing communication with C2 servers (Command and Control).
   - Using hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files (Defense Evasion).
   - Targeting Next Media websites (Impact).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic is about maintaining access to a network or system. While the attackers might have tried to persist their access, the question focuses on the outcome of the attack rather than the method of maintaining access.
   - **B: Impact** - This tactic is about causing harm or disruption to the target. The question states that the network was 'totally failed,' which aligns with the concept of causing significant impact.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection or defense mechanisms. While the use of hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files is a form of defense evasion, the question is more about the result of the attack rather than the method used to evade defenses.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attackers establishing and maintaining channels to control the bots. While this is part of the initial setup, the question is more focused on the outcome of the attack rather than the method of establishing C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the outcome described in the question is Impact, as it directly relates to the 'total failure' of the network.
   
Final Answer: B: Impact
