To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FIN13 exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware such as BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK, we need to analyze the sequence of actions and their corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Exploitation of External Servers**: This is the initial step where FIN13 uses external servers to deploy web shells and malware. This action is part of the "Initial Access" tactic.

2. **Deployment of Web Shells and Malware**: Once the external servers are exploited, the next step is to deploy web shells and malware. This action is part of the "Execution" tactic, as it involves running malicious code or scripts.

3. **Establishing a Foothold**: After deploying the web shells and malware, the next step is to establish a foothold in the victim network. This involves ensuring that the malware remains active and can be used to further compromise the network. This action is part of the "Persistence" tactic.

Given the sequence of actions:
- Exploitation of external servers (Initial Access)
- Deployment of web shells and malware (Execution)
- Establishing a foothold (Persistence)

The most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the deployment of web shells and malware is Persistence, as it involves ensuring the malware remains active and can be used to further compromise the network.

Final Answer: A: Persistence
