Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Sednit group used dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases.
   - This was followed by scanning the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first step was the use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases.
   - The next step was scanning the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the target network. While scanning network shared drives and removable media could be considered part of discovery, the initial use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases is more closely aligned with the collection of sensitive information.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information and assets on or from the victim's systems. The use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases is a clear example of collecting sensitive information.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or networks. While the ultimate goal might be to access systems using the credentials, the question specifically mentions the use of dumpers to retrieve the credentials, which is a form of collection.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the means to direct an adversary's access to and use of the compromised system. The question does not mention any actions related to establishing command and control channels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases is a direct action of collecting sensitive information.
   - Scanning the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions is a broader action that could be part of discovery, but it follows the collection of credentials.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the collection of credentials occurred first, followed by the broader discovery actions.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
