To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Konni APT Group delivered an ISO file containing malicious scripts.**
   - This action is related to the initial delivery of malware, which is typically categorized under the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **'stopedge.bat' was used to schedule tasks for maintaining persistence.**
   - This action is related to the tactic of "Persistence," as it involves the APT group using a script to ensure their access remains active over time.

Given this sequence, we need to identify the tactic that occurs between "Initial Access" and "Persistence."

- **Initial Access (C):** This tactic covers the methods an attacker uses to initially infiltrate a network or system.
- **Execution (A):** This tactic involves the running of code on the target system.
- **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves the methods an attacker uses to maintain access to the target system.
- **Privilege Escalation (D):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access privileges on a system.

The sequence of TTPs described in the question is:
1. Initial Access (delivering the ISO file)
2. Execution (running the malicious scripts)
3. Persistence (using 'stopedge.bat' to schedule tasks)

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after "Initial Access" and before "Persistence" is "Execution."

Final Answer: A
