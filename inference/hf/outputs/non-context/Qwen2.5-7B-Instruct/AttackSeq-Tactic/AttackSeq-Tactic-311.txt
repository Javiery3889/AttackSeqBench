Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack began with "establishing initial access through email attachments containing malicious VBA macros." This clearly indicates the use of Initial Access as the first step.

2. **Delphi Downloader**: The next step in the sequence is the use of a Delphi downloader, which is a tool used to download and execute other malware or payloads. This step would logically follow Initial Access.

3. **Information Gathering**: The question states that the Delphi downloader sent gathered information to a C&C server using `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST`. This is a form of information gathering, which is part of the Reconnaissance tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This is the tactic that involves gathering information about the target. The use of `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST` is a clear example of information gathering.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. There is no indication in the question that the malware has moved to other systems.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. While the Delphi downloader is an example of execution, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred before the execution of the Delphi downloader.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the target environment. The question already states that Initial Access has occurred.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Initial Access (establishing a foothold)
- Reconnaissance (gathering information)
- Execution (using the Delphi downloader)

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the Delphi downloader was used for information gathering is Reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
