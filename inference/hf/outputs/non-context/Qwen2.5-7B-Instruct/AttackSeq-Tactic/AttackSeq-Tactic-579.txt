To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **JavaScript Execution**: Higaisa utilized JavaScript to execute 'd3reEW.exe'. This is a form of code execution, which is a core part of the Execution Tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Decoding and Decompressing**: After executing the JavaScript, the next steps involve decoding a base64 blob and decompressing the content. These actions are preparatory steps for the actual payload and are part of the Execution Tactic as well.

3. **Defense Evasion**: The next steps mentioned are renaming 'certutil.exe' to 'gosia.exe' and adding scheduled tasks. These are techniques used to evade detection and maintain persistence, which are part of the Persistence Tactic.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Resource Development**: This tactic is not directly related to the actions described. It involves the development of tools and resources, which is not the immediate next step after executing a payload.

B. **Execution**: This tactic directly aligns with the actions described. Executing a payload, decoding, and decompressing content are all part of the Execution Tactic.

C. **Persistence**: While renaming executables and adding scheduled tasks are persistence techniques, they are not the immediate next steps after the initial execution and payload delivery. They are more likely to occur after the initial execution phase.

D. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.

Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Execution, followed by Persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
