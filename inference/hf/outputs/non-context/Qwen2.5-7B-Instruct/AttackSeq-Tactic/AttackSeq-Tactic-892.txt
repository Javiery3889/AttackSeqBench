To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the Inception attackers exploited the CVE-2017-11882 Office vulnerability to gain access to European targets using remote templates in Microsoft Word. This indicates that the attackers had already gained access to the target environment and were using a specific vulnerability to do so.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack. While reconnaissance is a common first step, the question does not specifically mention any reconnaissance activities.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the target. The question does not mention any data being stolen, so this is not the most likely sequence.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target environment. The exploitation of the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to gain access aligns closely with this tactic.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering data from the target. Similar to exfiltration, the question does not mention any data being collected or exfiltrated.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the exploitation of a vulnerability to gain access, which is a clear indication of the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - The other tactics (Reconnaissance, Exfiltration, and Collection) do not directly align with the specific actions described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the exploitation of the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability is "Initial Access."

Final Answer: C: Initial Access
