To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after CosmicDuke used FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communicated with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the provided answer choices.

1. **FTP and WebDav Servers for Malware Updates**: This indicates that the attackers are using these servers to distribute updates to their malware, which is a form of lateral movement and persistence. This activity is closely related to the "Command and Control" (T1071) tactic, as it involves the use of external servers to manage and update malware.

2. **Communication via HTTP GET Requests**: This is a method of maintaining communication between the malware and the attackers' infrastructure, which is also a key component of the "Command and Control" (T1071) tactic. HTTP GET requests are a common way to exfiltrate data or receive commands from a remote server.

Given these points, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to use the established Command and Control infrastructure for further actions, such as exfiltrating data or maintaining persistence.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to an external location. While it is a plausible next step, it is not directly related to the use of FTP, WebDav, and HTTP GET requests for updates and communication.

B. **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the use of FTP, WebDav, and HTTP GET requests for updates and communication.

C. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the development of tools and techniques to be used in future attacks. While it is a valid tactic, it is not directly related to the use of FTP, WebDav, and HTTP GET requests for updates and communication.

D. **Command and Control**: This tactic involves maintaining the ability to control and communicate with the compromised system. Given that the attackers are using FTP, WebDav, and HTTP GET requests for updates and communication, this is the most directly related tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
