Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The OceanLotus Group used a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook for command execution and data exfiltration.
   - They utilized HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target system. The use of HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control is a clear indication of this tactic.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to plan further attacks. While reconnaissance might have occurred before the backdoor was deployed, it is not directly related to the command-and-control aspect described.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the target system. While data exfiltration is mentioned, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after the command execution and data exfiltration, which is more closely related to the command-and-control aspect.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves the attacker avoiding detection by the defender. While this might be a part of the overall attack, it is not the immediate next step after command execution and data exfiltration.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is the Command and Control tactic, as it directly follows the execution of commands and the exfiltration of data, using HTTP and DNS Tunneling for maintaining control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
