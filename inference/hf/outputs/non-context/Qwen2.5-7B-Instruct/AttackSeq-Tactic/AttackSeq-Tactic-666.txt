To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Dexphot utilized process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes such as msiexec.exe and rundll32.exe, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the provided answer choices.

1. **Process Hollowing**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to execute it, thereby hiding the malicious activity from security software and the user. This is a method of execution.

2. **Next Tactic**: After successfully executing the malicious code within a legitimate process, the next step in an attack often involves ensuring the persistence of the malicious activity. This could be through various methods such as modifying system startup items, creating scheduled tasks, or using registry keys to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. After the initial execution of the malware, the attacker would likely want to ensure that the malicious code continues to run even after the system is restarted. This aligns well with the next step after successful execution.

- **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves stealing credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. While this could be a goal of the attack, it is not necessarily the next step after process hollowing, which is more about execution and persistence.

- **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. This is typically done before the initial attack or during the initial compromise, not after the execution of the malware.

- **D: Execution**: This tactic involves running the malicious code. Since the question states that process hollowing has already been used to execute the code, this is the initial step and not the next one.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that would follow the execution of the malware via process hollowing is Persistence.

Final Answer: A
