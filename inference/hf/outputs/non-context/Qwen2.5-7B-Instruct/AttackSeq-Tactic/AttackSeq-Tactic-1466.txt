Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described includes social engineering to enable macros, installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware, and then the use of BlackEnergy plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic facilitated communication between the malware and an external server before the credential harvesting and lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (T1071)** - This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining the ability to direct the compromised system. Communication between the malware and an external server is a key component of this tactic.
   - **B: Discovery (T1082)** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying information and resources to exploit them. It does not directly involve communication with an external server.
   - **C: Impact (T1486)** - This tactic involves the adversary causing damage or unwanted effects to systems or data. It does not directly involve communication with an external server.
   - **D: Collection (T1056)** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target system. It does not directly involve communication with an external server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the communication between the malware and an external server is what we are looking for.
   - Command and Control (T1071) is the only tactic that directly involves the communication between the malware and an external server, which is necessary for the malware to receive instructions or exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
