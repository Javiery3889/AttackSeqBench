Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs Mentioned in the Question:**
   - The question mentions two TTPs:
     - **Process Hollowing:** This is a technique used to hide malicious processes by injecting code into a legitimate process.
     - **CreateToolhelp32Snapshot:** This is a function used to enumerate processes in a system, which is often used for discovery purposes.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves the running of malicious code. While it is a logical step after identifying a process to execute malware, the question specifically mentions the use of the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot function for discovery, which suggests the next step might be related to further reconnaissance or action based on the discovered information.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information to understand the network, system, or user environment. The use of CreateToolhelp32Snapshot to identify the explorer process is a clear example of discovery.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the process of identifying and enumerating processes.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target. While this could be a step after discovery, the question does not explicitly mention the collection of data but rather the identification of a process.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question clearly states that the next step after using the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot function to identify the explorer process is a tactic that aligns with the purpose of the function used. Since the function is used for discovery, the next logical step would be to continue with the discovery process.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
