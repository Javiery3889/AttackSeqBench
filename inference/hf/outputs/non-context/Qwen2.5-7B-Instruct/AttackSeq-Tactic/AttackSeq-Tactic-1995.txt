Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the attackers have already harvested credentials using the Responder tool.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing network share and system information enumeration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution** - This tactic involves the creation and running of code. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to the harvesting of credentials or the subsequent actions of network share and system information enumeration.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the gathering of information to understand the target environment. This could include network share and system information enumeration, which are mentioned as the next steps.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. It is not directly related to the initial steps of harvesting credentials and network reconnaissance.
   - **D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is the first step mentioned in the question. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the network share and system information enumeration, not after.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The harvesting of credentials (using the Responder tool) is a form of Credential Access.
   - The next steps (network share and system information enumeration) are more closely aligned with the Discovery tactic, as they involve gathering information about the network and systems.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the network share and system information enumeration is Discovery.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
