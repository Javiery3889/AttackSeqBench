To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Backdoor performed persistence checks and wrote startup items**: This indicates that the attacker has already established persistence on the target system, likely through a backdoor or other means. This aligns with the **Persistence** tactic.

2. **Gathered host information on the target system**: This step involves collecting data about the target system, such as system configurations, user information, etc.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is a step that could occur before gathering host information. However, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for gathering host information, as the attacker might already have credentials or other means to gather information.

- **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While this could be a step in the overall attack, it is not directly related to gathering host information on the current system.

- **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by the defender. While this could be a step in the overall attack, it is not directly related to gathering host information on the current system.

- **D: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. The question states that persistence checks and startup items have already been performed, so this step has already occurred.

Given the sequence described, the most logical step that would occur before gathering host information is **Credential Access**, as it provides the necessary credentials to access and gather information from the system.

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
