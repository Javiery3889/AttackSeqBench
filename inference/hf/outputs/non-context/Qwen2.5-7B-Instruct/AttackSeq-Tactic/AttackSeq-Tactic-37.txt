Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Avoiding detection by operating in memory.
     - Leveraging the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves stealing credentials. The described TTPs do not directly relate to stealing credentials, so this is unlikely.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or response by the defender. The PowerShell script operating in memory and using DCOM to execute files without saving them to disk are both methods to evade detection and response mechanisms.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. While the described TTPs are part of the execution process, they do not fully capture the nature of the described actions.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the communication between the attacker and the compromised system. The described TTPs do not involve communication with an external command and control server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The PowerShell script operating in memory and using DCOM to execute files without saving them to disk are both methods to evade detection and response mechanisms. This aligns most closely with the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - While these actions are part of the Execution tactic, the primary focus of the question is on the evasion aspect rather than the execution itself.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
