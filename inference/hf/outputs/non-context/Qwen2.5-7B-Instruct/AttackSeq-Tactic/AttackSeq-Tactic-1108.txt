Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server.
   - They conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Gaining access to the server.
   - Modifying a file on the server to include malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means to direct the compromised system.
     - Modifying a file to include malicious code is more about hiding the attacker's presence and maintaining control, but it is not the primary step in establishing C2.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves the attacker hiding their presence or actions from defenders.
     - Modifying a file to include malicious code is a form of hiding the attacker's actions and maintaining persistence, which aligns with defense evasion.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target network or system.
     - The question already states that the attackers gained access, so this is not the next step.
   - **D: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves the attacker developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure used in the attack.
     - While this could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, the specific action of modifying a file is more directly related to defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of modifying a file to include malicious code, aligns best with the tactic of Defense Evasion.

Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
