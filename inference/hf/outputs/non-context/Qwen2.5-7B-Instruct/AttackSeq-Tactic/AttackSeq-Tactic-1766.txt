Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network. The question mentions phishing emails and social engineering techniques, which are methods of initial access. However, the question states that these techniques were used to establish backdoors, which implies that initial access has already occurred.

2. **Impact**: This tactic involves the adversary causing harm or achieving their objective within the target's network. The question does not mention any direct impact or harm being caused at this stage; it focuses on the setup for further actions.

3. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing tools, resources, or infrastructure to support their operations. The question mentions the installation of a legitimate monitoring tool like 'Mipko' to capture screen and keystroke information, which is a resource development activity. However, this is described as occurring after the backdoor establishment.

4. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary executing their plan to achieve their objectives. The question describes the establishment of backdoors and the subsequent use of a monitoring tool, which aligns with the execution phase of an attack.

Given the sequence of events described in the question:
- Phishing emails and social engineering to establish backdoors (likely Initial Access or Execution)
- Installation of a legitimate monitoring tool (Resource Development)

The most plausible sequence of TTPs that fits the described attack sequence is Execution, as it encompasses the actions of establishing backdoors and preparing for further actions.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
