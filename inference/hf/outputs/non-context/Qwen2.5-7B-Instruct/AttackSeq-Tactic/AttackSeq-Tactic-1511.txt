Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Pro-democracy activists received a phishing email containing a malicious RAR archive.
   - The attackers created two separate infection chains using executables within the archive.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This typically involves gathering information about the target. While reconnaissance could have occurred before the phishing email, it is not directly related to the actions described in the sequence.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This involves obtaining credentials, which would likely occur after the initial infection and execution of the malware. It is not the immediate next step after receiving the malicious RAR archive.
   - **C: Execution** - This involves running the malicious code. The question states that the attackers created two separate infection chains using executables within the archive, which implies that the malicious code has been executed.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This involves the initial entry point into the target environment, such as through a phishing email. The question mentions that the activists received a phishing email containing a malicious RAR archive, which is the initial access.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with the initial access (receiving the phishing email) and then moves to the execution of the malicious code (creating two separate infection chains using executables within the archive).

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from Initial Access to Execution.

**Final Answer: D**
