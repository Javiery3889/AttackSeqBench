Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access (A)**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The question mentions that TA413 delivered a phishing email, which is a method of initial access. However, the question is asking about what happened after the phishing email and the fake 'Adobe Flash Player Update' landing page.

2. **Defense Evasion (B)**: This tactic involves the adversary taking steps to avoid being detected or investigated. While the landing page might be designed to evade detection, the question is more focused on the actions taken after the adversary has gained some level of access or control.

3. **Discovery (C)**: This tactic involves the adversary learning information about the target's environment, such as system configurations, network topology, and user accounts. The question states that the landing page was used to profile the user's system, which aligns with the goal of gathering information about the target's environment.

4. **Credential Access (D)**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or networks. While the landing page might be used to steal credentials, the question does not explicitly mention credential theft as the next step after profiling the system.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible next step after profiling the user's system would be to gather more information about the environment to determine the best way to deliver the FriarFox browser extension. This aligns with the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: C**
