Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions Stuxnet, which is known for its sophisticated attack techniques.
   - It specifically mentions the use of rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates.
   - The question then asks about the tactic used to exploit MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates are related to defense evasion, the question is specifically about the spread across networked systems.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves the running of code on the target system. Exploiting vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems is more about moving laterally or spreading, not just executing code.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. Exploiting vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems fits this description perfectly.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While this is a part of the overall attack, the question is more focused on the spread across networked systems rather than the initial C2 setup.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is specifically about the spread across networked systems after exploiting the vulnerabilities.
   - Exploiting MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems is a clear example of moving laterally from one system to another.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this context is Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
