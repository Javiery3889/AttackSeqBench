Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Tickusb infected systems via USB flash drives**: This indicates the initial method of entry or initial access to the system. This aligns with the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Evasion of detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot**: This suggests that after the initial infection, the malware is trying to hide its presence and avoid detection. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic, as it involves running or executing the malware in a way that avoids detection.

3. **Identifying the sequence**: The sequence described is from initial infection to evasion. Therefore, the correct sequence should be from "Initial Access" to "Execution".

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary learning information about the target's environment. It does not fit the sequence as it comes after the malware has already infected the system.
- **B: Initial Access**: This is the first step in the sequence, which matches the infection via USB flash drives.
- **C: Execution**: This is the next step after initial access, where the malware runs or executes to achieve its objectives.
- **D: Privilege Escalation**: This involves gaining higher-level access to the system, which is not mentioned in the sequence and comes after execution in many scenarios.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from "Initial Access" to "Execution".

**Final Answer: C**
