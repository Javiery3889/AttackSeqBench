Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     - WinDealer maintaining persistence through the registry's RUN key.
     - Configuration updates.
     - Initiation of communication with machines selected using a complex IP generation algorithm.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - This TTP is mentioned in the question as the first step (WinDealer maintaining persistence through the registry's RUN key).
     - However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after persistence and before the initiation of communication.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**
     - This TTP is not directly mentioned in the question. While it could be a step in the attack chain, it is not explicitly linked to the sequence described.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - This TTP involves identifying and classifying information and resources that are of value to the adversary. It could logically follow persistence and before communication, as the adversary might need to discover which machines to communicate with.
   - **D: Impact**
     - This TTP involves the adversary taking action to fulfill the goals of the attack, such as data exfiltration or system damage. It is likely to occur after communication has been established.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question specifies that the sequence should be after persistence and before communication.
   - **Discovery** fits well as it involves the adversary identifying which machines to communicate with, which logically comes after establishing persistence but before initiating communication.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
