Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Deep Panda's Milestone backdoor has established communication with its C2 server by sending information about current sessions on the system.
   - This indicates that the backdoor has already established a connection and is now communicating with the C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The backdoor has already established communication, which is a form of Command and Control (C2) activity.
   - The next logical step would be to gather more information about the system, which is typically done through the Discovery tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This is the initial step where the backdoor establishes communication with the C2 server. The question already states that this has occurred.
   - **B: Discovery**: After establishing C2, the next step is often to gather information about the system, which is the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving from one system to another, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **D: Exfiltration**: This involves stealing data from the system, which is not mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the information provided, is that after establishing C2, the next step would be to gather information about the system, which is the Discovery tactic.

Final Answer: B: Discovery
