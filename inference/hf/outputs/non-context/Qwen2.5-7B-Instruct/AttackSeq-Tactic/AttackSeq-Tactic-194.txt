Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The question mentions that the Hellsing APT group used spear-phishing documents with CVE-2012-0158 exploits to gain access to the target systems. This clearly indicates the use of the Initial Access tactic.

2. **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels for command and control. The question states that the backdoor connected to a server to carry out actions like uploading and downloading files. This is a clear indication of Command and Control.

3. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. While this could be part of the overall attack, the specific action described (connecting to a server to upload and download files) is more directly related to Command and Control.

4. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves the adversary moving through the network to other systems. The question does not mention the adversary moving to other systems, but rather connecting to a specific server to perform file operations.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is the one that involves the backdoor connecting to a server to perform file operations, which is a clear indication of Command and Control.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
