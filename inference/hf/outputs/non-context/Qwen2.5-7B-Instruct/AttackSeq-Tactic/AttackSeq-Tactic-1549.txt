Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers gathered information about the victim's computer, including OS version, username, and anti-virus details.
   - This information gathering is a form of reconnaissance.
   - The attackers then used a backdoor to send exfiltrated data like files and screenshots over the C&C channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attackers establishing and maintaining the ability to direct an infected host or network. While C2 is involved in the exfiltration step, it is not the initial step of gathering information.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the attackers gathering information to be used in a future attack. The question clearly states that the attackers gathered information about the victim's computer, which fits this description perfectly.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This is not mentioned in the question, as the focus is on gathering information and exfiltration.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves the attackers gathering and storing data from the victim's system. While this is related to the exfiltration of files and screenshots, it is not the initial step of gathering information.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers first gather information about the victim's computer, which is a form of reconnaissance.
   - After gathering this information, they use a backdoor to send exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after gathering the information and before exfiltration.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
