Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - APT28 installed key components to the disk using the second stage dropper.
   - APT28 used a tool for exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability to execute files with elevated permissions.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This is the tactic that APT28 used to execute files with elevated permissions. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** this step.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. Installing key components to the disk and using a second stage dropper are actions that can be part of persistence.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defenders. While it's possible that APT28 used such techniques, the question does not specifically mention evasion.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. The installation of key components and the use of a second stage dropper are more about establishing a foothold rather than gathering information.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The installation of key components and the use of a second stage dropper are actions that are typically part of the persistence tactic. These actions are used to ensure that the malware remains on the system and can be activated later.
   - After persistence, APT28 would then use privilege escalation to execute files with elevated permissions.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Persistence followed by Privilege Escalation.

**Final Answer: B**
