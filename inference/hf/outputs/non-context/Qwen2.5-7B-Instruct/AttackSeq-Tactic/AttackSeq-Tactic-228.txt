Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions exploiting the CVE-2017-0262 vulnerability in malicious attachments to gain initial access to Russian banks. This clearly indicates the use of the "Initial Access" tactic.

2. **Establishing Communication**: The question states that the malware established communication at five-second intervals with a compromised server. This action is indicative of the "Command and Control" (C2) tactic, where the malware communicates with a server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described in the question involves gaining initial access and then establishing a communication channel. While "Initial Access" is the first step, the question is specifically asking about the tactic that describes the communication established after gaining access.

4. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Initial Access**: This is the first step but not the one that describes the communication established.
   - **B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This is the tactic that describes the communication established with a server.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic involves running the malware, which is not the focus of the question.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is "Command and Control."

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
