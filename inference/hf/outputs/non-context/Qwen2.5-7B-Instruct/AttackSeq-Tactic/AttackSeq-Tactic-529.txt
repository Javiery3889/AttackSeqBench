Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attackers gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks. This clearly indicates the use of the "Initial Access" tactic.

2. **Campaigns and C&C/IPs**: The question states that Desert Falcons managed three separate campaigns with different Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure and IP addresses. This suggests that the attackers are maintaining control over their victims by using these different C&C channels.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described involves gaining initial access and then maintaining control over the victims. The "Command and Control" tactic is directly related to maintaining control over the compromised systems.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the victim's network to the attacker's infrastructure. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access and managing multiple campaigns.

- **B: Initial Access**: This is the first step mentioned in the question, but it is not the ongoing tactic that maintains control over the victims.

- **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target. While reconnaissance might have occurred before the initial access, it is not the ongoing tactic that maintains control over the victims.

- **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attackers maintaining control over the compromised systems using C&C infrastructure. This aligns perfectly with the description of managing multiple campaigns with different C&C/IPs to maintain control over the victims.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
