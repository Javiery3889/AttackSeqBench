Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign used a custom storage file format for data collection.
   - After data collection, the data was exfiltrated over a C2 channel.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This is the final step in the sequence as the data is being sent out of the network.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This is typically the initial step where the attacker gathers information about the target environment, which is not directly related to the data collection or exfiltration mentioned.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This is the process of maintaining control over the compromised system, which is more related to the C2 channel used for exfiltration rather than the data collection phase.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This involves gaining higher-level access within the network, which is not directly related to the data collection or exfiltration process.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after data collection but before exfiltration. The data collection method used a custom storage file format, which implies that the attacker has already gathered and stored the data locally on the compromised system.
   - The next logical step before exfiltration would be to ensure that the data is properly stored and possibly encrypted or obfuscated to avoid detection during the exfiltration process.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the storage and preparation of the data for exfiltration, which aligns with the Command and Control (C2) channel being used for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
