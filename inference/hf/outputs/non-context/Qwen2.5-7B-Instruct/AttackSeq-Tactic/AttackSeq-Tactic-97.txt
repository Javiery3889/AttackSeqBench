Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that APT-TOCS utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
   - It also states that the execution happened in memory to evade detection via operations without hard disk writing.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is not directly related to the execution of scripts via PowerShell in memory.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. While it could be a part of the overall attack sequence, it does not directly align with the execution of scripts in memory.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system. The question specifically mentions the use of PowerShell to execute Shellcode scripts, which aligns with the Execution tactic.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target system. While it could be a part of the overall attack sequence, it does not directly align with the execution of scripts in memory.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the PowerShell execution was done in memory to evade detection. This aligns with the Execution tactic, which involves running malicious code.
   - The sequence of TTPs described (using PowerShell to execute Shellcode scripts) is a direct example of the Execution tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
