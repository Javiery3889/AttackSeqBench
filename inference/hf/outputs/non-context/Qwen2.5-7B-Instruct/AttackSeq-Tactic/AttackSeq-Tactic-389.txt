Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the execution of VBA macros within malicious Word documents.
   - It then mentions that the scripts from these documents began communicating with external servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The execution of VBA macros is a form of initial access, which is the first step in the attack lifecycle.
   - The communication with external servers is a form of command and control (C2) activity, which is a tactic used to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution** - This is the initial step where the malware is executed. However, the question specifically mentions communication with external servers, which is a different phase.
   - **B: Impact** - This refers to the damage or effect the attacker wants to achieve. While this is a critical phase, it is not directly related to the communication with external servers.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This is the tactic where the attacker establishes a means to control the compromised system. Communicating with external servers is a key component of this tactic.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This is the method used to initially get a foothold on the target system. While this is relevant, it does not cover the communication phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Command and Control, as it directly relates to the communication with external servers.

Final Answer: C
