Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The scenario describes Iron Tiger gaining access to the Mimi chat developer's backend and compromising its servers through a supply chain attack.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial access to the backend and compromise of servers through a supply chain attack is a form of initial access.
   - The next logical step after gaining access and compromising the servers would be to exfiltrate data or information from the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker developing tools, resources, or infrastructure. It is not directly related to the immediate actions after gaining access.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the attacker extracting data from the compromised system. Given that the attacker has gained access and compromised the servers, the next step would likely be to extract valuable information.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic is about the initial entry into the target network. Since the question specifies that the initial access has already occurred, this is not the next step.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the attacker avoiding detection or response. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after gaining access and compromising the servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining access and compromising the servers would be to exfiltrate the data or information that the attacker has obtained.

Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
