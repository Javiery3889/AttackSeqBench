Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Turla used LightNeuron to discover system network configurations.
   - Turla used emails to conduct C&C communication with encrypted data hidden in PDF or JPG files.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining long-term presence within a network. While persistence is a crucial step in many cyber attacks, it doesn't directly relate to the specific actions of discovering network configurations or conducting C&C communication.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining initial access to the target network. While it's a necessary step, it doesn't fit the sequence as it precedes the discovery of network configurations.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target. Discovering system network configurations is a form of data collection, as it involves gathering information about the target environment. This fits well as the step between initial access and C&C communication.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing channels to exfiltrate data or send commands to the compromised system. The question states that emails were used for C&C communication, which fits this tactic. However, this is the step after the collection of network configurations.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Initial Access -> Collection (Discovering network configurations) -> Command and Control (Using emails for C&C).
   - Among the given choices, "Collection" (Choice C) is the most appropriate step that fits between the discovery of network configurations and the C&C communication.

**Final Answer: C**
