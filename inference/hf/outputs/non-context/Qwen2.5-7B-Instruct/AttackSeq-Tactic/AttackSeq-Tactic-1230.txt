To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the V1 server connected to V2's SMB service to perform sensitive operations during lateral movement, let's analyze the sequence of events and the corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **V1 server connects to V2's SMB service**: This action is part of the lateral movement tactic, where the attacker moves from one system to another within the network to gain access to sensitive information or systems.

2. **Performing sensitive operations**: This action is part of the Lateral Movement tactic, as it involves the attacker using the compromised system to access other systems or sensitive data.

Given the sequence of events, we need to identify the tactic that would logically precede the connection to the SMB service and the subsequent sensitive operations.

- **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used in the attack. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the connection to the SMB service or the sensitive operations.
- **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target network or systems. This is a strong candidate as it would provide the necessary information to identify and connect to the SMB service.
- **Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code or scripts. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the connection to the SMB service or the sensitive operations.
- **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining initial access to the target network. While it is a necessary step, it is not directly related to the connection to the SMB service or the sensitive operations.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The attacker gathers information about the network and identifies the SMB service on V2.
2. **Connection to SMB service**: The V1 server connects to V2's SMB service.
3. **Lateral Movement**: The attacker uses the connection to perform sensitive operations on V2.

Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the V1 server connected to V2's SMB service is **Reconnaissance**.

Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
