To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before WinDealer processed and staged stolen data in the %TEMP% folder by collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications, let's analyze the sequence of actions described and compare it to the provided answer choices.

1. **WinDealer Processing and Staging Stolen Data in the %TEMP% Folder**: This action involves the actual processing and storage of stolen data, which is a step in the data handling phase of an attack.

2. **Collecting Network Configuration and Details from SNS Applications**: This action involves gathering information that could be used to understand the network environment and target specific applications, which is a preparatory step.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications. While credentials might be used in the process, the question specifically mentions network configuration and SNS applications.

- **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the target environment. Collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications falls under the category of gathering information about the network and applications, which is a form of discovery.

- **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing tools and resources to be used in the attack. While this could be a part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the specific actions of collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications.

- **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment. While this is close, the specific action of collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications is more aligned with the broader category of discovery.

Given the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred before WinDealer processed and staged stolen data is **Discovery**, as it encompasses the specific actions of collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications.

Final Answer: B
