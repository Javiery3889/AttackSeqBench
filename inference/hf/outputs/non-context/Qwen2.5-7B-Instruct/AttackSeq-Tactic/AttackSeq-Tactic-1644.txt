To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the SideCopy APT group developed resources such as phishing portals mimicking the Government of India's webmail and before deploying a variety of RATs and post-infection plugins, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and match it with the appropriate ATT&CK tactic.

1. **Developing Resources**: The SideCopy APT group created phishing portals mimicking the Government of India's webmail. This is a form of initial access, where the attackers gain a foothold in the target's network or system.

2. **Deploying RATs and Post-Infection Plugins**: After gaining initial access, the group would likely deploy Remote Access Tools (RATs) and other post-infection plugins to maintain control and gather information.

Given this sequence, we need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that best fits the step of developing and deploying the phishing portal.

- **Privilege Escalation (A)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. It is not the first step in the sequence but rather a step that occurs after initial access.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves running code or commands on the target system. While this is part of the overall attack, it is not the first step in the sequence.
- **Persistence (C)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. It is a step that occurs after initial access and execution but not the first step.
- **Initial Access (D)**: This tactic involves the methods and techniques used to first gain access to the target environment. Developing and deploying a phishing portal is a method of initial access.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after developing resources such as phishing portals and before deploying RATs and post-infection plugins is Initial Access.

Final Answer: D
