Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Darkhotel APT.
   - The APT first evades detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors.
   - Then, it encrypts gathered data in log files.
   - The final step mentioned is targeting stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. While the APT might use lateral movement to access different systems, the question focuses on the final step of accessing stored secrets and credentials.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection or response by the defender. The question already mentions this as the first step, so it's not the final step.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network over a long period. While persistence is crucial, the question is more focused on the final action of accessing stored secrets and credentials.
   - **D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or data. The final step described in the question is directly related to accessing stored secrets and credentials from browsers and email services.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question includes evading detection, encrypting data, and then accessing stored secrets and credentials.
   - The final step of accessing stored secrets and credentials aligns most closely with the Credential Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
