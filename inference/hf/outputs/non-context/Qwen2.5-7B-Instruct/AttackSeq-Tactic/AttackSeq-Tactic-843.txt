Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Longhorn gained initial access through a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
   - After gaining initial access, the group conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. While it is a common step after gaining initial access, the question does not specify that the group needed to escalate privileges before conducting system discovery.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection by the defender. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods and techniques used to initially compromise a system. The question already states that Longhorn gained initial access, so this is not the next step.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker learning about the network and systems to understand the environment. This aligns with the description of conducting detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations after gaining initial access.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question indicates that after gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to conduct detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations. This aligns perfectly with the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
