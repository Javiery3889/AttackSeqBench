To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the use of base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the context provided.

1. **Base64 Encoding and Layered URL String Obfuscation**: These techniques are primarily used to evade detection and analysis by security tools. They are part of the broader category of "Defense Evasion" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Decoy XLS and JScript File**: The use of decoys (XLS and JScript files) is a common tactic to mislead or distract the security team, which falls under the "Deception" sub-technique of the "Defense Evasion" tactic.

Given that the question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these techniques, we need to consider the next logical step in the attack lifecycle. The techniques mentioned (base64 encoding, URL obfuscation, and use of decoys) are all part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic. The next step in the attack sequence would be to actually execute the payload or perform actions that would lead to further exploitation or data exfiltration.

3. **Reconnaissance (Tactic A)**: This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. While it is a common first step, it does not directly follow the use of evasion techniques.

4. **Initial Access (Tactic B)**: This tactic involves the initial entry into the target network. While it is a crucial step, it typically precedes the use of evasion techniques rather than following them.

5. **Discovery (Tactic C)**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and services within the target network. While it is a logical step after gaining access, it is not directly related to the use of evasion techniques.

6. **Defense Evasion (Tactic D)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Since the question specifically mentions techniques that are part of "Defense Evasion," the next step would logically be to continue with further evasion or to perform actions that are not easily detectable.

Given the context and the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible next step after using techniques to evade detection would be to continue with further evasion or to perform actions that are not easily detectable. Therefore, the most logical next ATT&CK tactic is "Defense Evasion."

Final Answer: D
