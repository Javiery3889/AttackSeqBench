To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each step:

1. **Exploitation of a Zero-Day Vulnerability**: The attack started with the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome, which allowed for arbitrary read/write access through a Use-After-Free condition.

2. **Arbitrary Read/Write Access**: This step indicates that the attackers gained the ability to manipulate memory, which is a critical step in gaining control over the system.

3. **Triggering Malware Persistence**: The next step mentioned is the installation of tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence. This means that the attackers are ensuring that their malware will continue to run even after the initial infection vector is removed or the system is restarted.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Execution**: This tactic involves the running of code on the target system. While the exploitation of the vulnerability and arbitrary read/write access are part of the execution process, the question specifically mentions the installation of tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler, which is more closely aligned with the Persistence tactic.

- **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. The installation of tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler is a clear example of this tactic, as it ensures that the malware will continue to run and maintain access to the system.

- **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection and analysis by the defender. While this could be a part of the overall attack strategy, the question does not specifically mention any actions taken to evade detection or defenses.

- **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target system to an external location. The question does not mention any data being exfiltrated, so this is not the most likely sequence of TTPs.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly follows the exploitation and manipulation of the system, leading to the installation of tasks for persistence.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
