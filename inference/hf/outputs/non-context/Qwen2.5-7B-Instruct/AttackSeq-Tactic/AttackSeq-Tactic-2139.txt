Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - They then exported data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials, which aligns with the first step of gaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the specific actions of gaining credentials and exporting data.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the adversary avoiding detection or blocking defensive measures. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the specific actions of gaining credentials and exporting data.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information or data from the target environment. This aligns with the second step of exporting data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves gaining credentials and then using those credentials to export data. The most logical sequence would be to first gain the credentials (Credential Access) and then use those credentials to perform the data collection (Collection).

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
