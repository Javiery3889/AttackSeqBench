Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - Turla used an RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor to gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives.
   - The information was then exfiltrated through an encrypted OneDrive subfolder via the command and control channel.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves gathering information (Discovery) and then exfiltrating that information (Exfiltration).
   - The use of a backdoor to gather information and the subsequent exfiltration through a command and control channel are part of the overall attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control** - This tactic is used for maintaining access to the target system and is not directly related to the initial gathering of information or the exfiltration process.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying the target and its resources. The question mentions gathering file and directory information and monitoring USB drives, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. The question states that the information was exfiltrated, so this is a later step in the sequence.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target. The question mentions gathering file and directory information, which aligns with the Collection tactic.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs should logically start with the initial gathering of information (Collection) and then proceed to the exfiltration of that information (Exfiltration).
   - The use of a command and control channel for exfiltration is a later step and not the initial tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
