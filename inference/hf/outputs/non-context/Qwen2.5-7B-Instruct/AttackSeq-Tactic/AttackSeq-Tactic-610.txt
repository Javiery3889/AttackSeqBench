To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Armageddon Group used a malicious VBScript and abused the Telegram service to obtain the real C2 IP address, bypassing DNS, we need to analyze the sequence of actions and their corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's environment. The use of a malicious VBScript to initially gain access to the system fits this category.

2. **Bypassing DNS**: Once the adversary has initial access, they use a malicious VBScript to obtain the real C2 IP address by abusing the Telegram service, bypassing DNS. This action is a form of **Defense Evasion**, as it involves avoiding detection and defense mechanisms.

3. **Command and Control (C2)**: After obtaining the C2 IP address, the adversary would likely establish a channel to communicate with the C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. This is the **Command and Control** tactic.

4. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary ensuring that they can maintain access to the target's environment over time. While this is a common goal, it is not directly related to the specific actions described in the question.

Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that follows the initial use of a malicious VBScript and the subsequent bypassing of DNS is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
