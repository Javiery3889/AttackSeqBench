Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect the communications.
   - This indicates that the malware has already established a connection with the C&C servers, which is a form of Command and Control (C2) activity.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying the network and systems. The question does not mention any discovery activities; it focuses on the communication aspect.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the target network. While the malware might eventually exfiltrate data, the question does not provide any information about data theft.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves the adversary moving from one system to another within the target network. The question does not mention the malware moving to other systems.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining the network infrastructure to control the compromised systems. The question describes the malware communicating with C&C servers, which is a clear example of Command and Control.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware is communicating with C&C servers, which is a direct example of Command and Control.
   - The question does not provide any information that would suggest the malware has moved to other systems or is in the process of stealing data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: D**
