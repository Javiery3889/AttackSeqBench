Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where valid credentials are obtained for lateral movement, and then the attacker locates relevant systems, users, and data.
   - The key point is that the attacker is looking for specific information within the network after gaining access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is mentioned in the question as the first step. However, it does not describe the process of locating relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While this is mentioned in the question, it is described as occurring after the credential access, not as the step to locate relevant systems.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and services on the network. It aligns with the question's description of locating relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **D: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering the data that the attacker is interested in. The question states that this occurs after the discovery of relevant systems, users, and data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Credential Access -> Lateral Movement -> Discovery -> Collection.
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurs to locate relevant systems, users, and data, which is the step between credential access and data collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question is the "Discovery" tactic.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
