To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Gamaredon employed scripting such as Batch files and VBScript to execute payloads from C&C servers, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs step-by-step.

1. **Identify the TTPs in the Question:**
   - The question mentions the use of scripting (Batch files and VBScript) to execute payloads from Command and Control (C&C) servers. This is a TTP under the Execution tactic.

2. **Understand the Sequence:**
   - For Gamaredon to use scripting to execute payloads, they must first have a way to gain access to the target environment and establish a foothold. This initial access is a prerequisite for any further actions, including the use of scripts to execute payloads.

3. **Evaluate Each Option:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or interference by defensive measures. While this could be a part of the overall attack strategy, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions leading to the use of scripts.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The use of scripts to execute payloads is a specific example of this tactic. However, this is the action that follows initial access, not the one that precedes it.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods used to initially infiltrate a network or system. This is the first step in the attack sequence, which logically precedes the use of scripts to execute payloads.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to discover additional targets. This is a step that occurs after initial access and the use of scripts to execute payloads, not before.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Initial Access (C) occurs first, followed by the use of scripts to execute payloads (Execution).

Final Answer: C: Initial Access
