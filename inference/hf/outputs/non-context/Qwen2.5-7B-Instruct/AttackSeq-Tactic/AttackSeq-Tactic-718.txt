Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information.
   - The Naikon APT group collected files, screenshots, and metadata.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic facilitated communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection (A):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While the backdoor and APT group did gather information, this is not the tactic that facilitates communication with the C&C server.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. This is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their properties. This is also not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the ability to direct the target's resources. This directly aligns with the communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor and the Naikon APT group's actions are focused on gathering information (Collection).
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that facilitates communication with the C&C server, which is a key aspect of Command and Control.
   - Privilege Escalation and Discovery do not directly relate to the communication aspect of the attack.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
