Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence starts with gaining initial access through spear phishing emails containing malicious documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - The next step is establishing connections to C2 servers using backdoors such as HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial access is achieved through spear phishing and exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).
   - The next step is establishing a connection to the C2 server using backdoors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it is a crucial step in the APT lifecycle, it typically occurs after initial access and before establishing a C2 connection.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target system. Establishing a C2 connection is a part of this tactic, but it is not the first step after initial access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defenders. While it can occur at any point in the attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the sequence of gaining access and establishing a C2 connection.
   - **D: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure used in the attack. While this can include the development of backdoors, it is not the immediate step after initial access.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (initial access through spear phishing and exploiting a vulnerability, followed by establishing a C2 connection) aligns most closely with the **Command and Control** tactic. This is because establishing a C2 connection is a key part of the Command and Control phase, where the attacker sets up the infrastructure to communicate with the compromised system.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
