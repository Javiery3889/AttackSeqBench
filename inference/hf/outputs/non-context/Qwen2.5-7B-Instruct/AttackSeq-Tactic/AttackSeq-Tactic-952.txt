To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described sequence of TTPs, let's break down the information provided and analyze each step.

1. **Poison Ivy's network communications were encrypted using the Camellia cipher**: This indicates that the attackers are using a specific encryption method to obfuscate their communications, which is a form of **Defense Evasion**. This tactic is used to avoid detection by security systems.

2. **Blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443**: This suggests that the encrypted traffic is being made to look like legitimate HTTPS traffic, which is also a form of **Defense Evasion**. This tactic helps the attackers blend in with normal network traffic to avoid detection.

Given these two steps, the next logical ATT&CK tactic would be one that builds upon the evasion and blending of traffic to maintain control or persistence over the compromised system.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker identifying useful information about the victim's network or system. While this could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly follow the blending of traffic, which is more about maintaining control and avoiding detection.

- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing a channel to control the compromised system. Given that the traffic is already being blended with normal SSL traffic, the next step would likely be to use this channel to issue commands and maintain control over the system.

- **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic is already being used in the described sequence. The next step would likely be to use the established channel for more active control.

- **D: Persistence**: This tactic involves the attacker ensuring that they can maintain access to the compromised system over time. While this is a critical step, it is often a follow-up to establishing a command and control channel.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible next step would be to use the established channel to issue commands and maintain control over the system.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
