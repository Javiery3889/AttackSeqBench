Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - CosmicStrand modifies firmware images to introduce attacker-supplied code.
   - CosmicStrand deploys a malicious component during system startup.
   - CosmicStrand tests internet connectivity.
   - CosmicStrand sends crafted packets to its C2 server for payload retrieval.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Impact** - This tactic involves the adversary causing damage or unwanted effects on the victim's systems. While the actions described could lead to impact, the question specifically mentions testing internet connectivity and sending packets to a C2 server, which is more indicative of a communication or control action rather than an impact.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels for control over the victim's systems. The actions of testing internet connectivity and sending packets to a C2 server are directly related to establishing and maintaining a command and control channel.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the adversary avoiding detection or interference from defensive measures. While this could be a part of the overall strategy, the specific actions described (testing connectivity and sending packets) are more directly related to establishing a C2 channel.
   - **D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. The actions described do not involve credential access but rather establishing a communication channel.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is establishing a command and control channel to test connectivity and send packets to the C2 server.
   
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
