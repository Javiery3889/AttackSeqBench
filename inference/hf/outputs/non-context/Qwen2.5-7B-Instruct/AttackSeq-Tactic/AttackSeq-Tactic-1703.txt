Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Cinobi** is the actor in question.
   - **Compromising victims' web browsers for form-grabbing** and **modifying web traffic to targeted Japanese banking websites** are the initial TTPs.
   - The next step involves **downloading various stages of the malware and configuration files from a .onion C&C address**.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is already covered by the initial TTPs of form-grabbing and modifying web traffic.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining the adversary's control over the compromised system. Downloading malware and configuration files from a .onion C&C address is a clear example of this tactic.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While downloading files could be part of data collection, the specific action of downloading from a .onion C&C address is more aligned with establishing control.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network. The question does not mention moving to other systems or networks, so this is less likely.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial TTPs (stealing credentials and modifying web traffic) are part of the **Credential Access** tactic.
   - The next step of downloading malware and configuration files from a .onion C&C address is a clear example of establishing and maintaining control, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
