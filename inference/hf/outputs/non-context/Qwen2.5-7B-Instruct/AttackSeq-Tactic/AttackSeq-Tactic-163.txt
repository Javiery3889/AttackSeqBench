Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that a Jupyter infostealer collected data from web browsers, including autocomplete data, cookies, and passwords.
   - It then states that this data was communicated to a C2 server in Russia.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining perishable channels with one or more targets to deliver commands and exfiltrate data. While the communication with the C2 server is mentioned, the question focuses on the data collection phase, not the command and control aspect.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the adversary transferring data from the victim's system to a remote location. The question states that the collected data was communicated to a C2 server, which implies the transfer of data from the victim's system to an external location.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials, which aligns with the collection of passwords. However, the question is more about the overall data collection and communication, not just the credentials.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the adversary avoiding or reducing the detection of their actions by the defender. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the data collection and communication phase described in the question.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the exfiltration of the collected data to the C2 server.

Final Answer: B
