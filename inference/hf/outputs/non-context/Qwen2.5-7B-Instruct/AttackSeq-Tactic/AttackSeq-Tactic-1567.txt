Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Konni APT used obfuscated scripts to manage the deletion of evidence.
   - It then states that 'versioninfo.bat' was used to discover system details.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving across networks to other systems. The question does not mention moving to other systems, so this is unlikely.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information to understand the network, system, and users. The use of 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details aligns with this tactic.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection or response by the defender. While the deletion of evidence ('versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs') is a form of defense evasion, the question specifically mentions 'versioninfo.bat' for discovery, not just evasion.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves causing damage or unwanted effects on the network or system. The question does not mention any impact or damage, so this is unlikely.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that 'versioninfo.bat' was used to discover system details. This aligns with the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The deletion of evidence ('versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs') is a form of Defense Evasion, but it is not the immediate next step after the discovery of system details.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
