Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. In the scenario, the malicious FriarFox browser extension was delivered via a phishing email, which is a method of initial access. However, the question asks about the tactic that occurred before the contact with the command and control server.

2. **Collection**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information from the target's network or system. While this could be a step in the process, the question specifies an action that happens before the contact with the command and control server.

3. **Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing a two-way communication channel with the compromised system to control it. The question mentions that the threat actors contacted the command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload, which aligns with this tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this step.

4. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the adversary taking steps to avoid being detected or investigated. While this could be a step in the process, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions leading to the contact with the command and control server.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:

1. Initial Access (delivering the malicious FriarFox browser extension via a phishing email).
2. Command and Control (contacting the command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload).

The tactic that occurred before the contact with the command and control server is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
