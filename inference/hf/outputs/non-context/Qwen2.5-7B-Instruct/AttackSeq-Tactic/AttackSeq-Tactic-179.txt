Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already gained initial access to the system through malicious installers or phishing campaigns.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure that the malicious operations continue across system reboots.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic is about gaining access to the target environment. The question already states that initial access has been achieved, so this is not the next step.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running the malware or other code on the target system. While this is necessary, it does not ensure that the operations continue across reboots.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system even after the initial compromise. This includes methods like creating scheduled tasks, modifying the registry, or using autorun features to ensure the malware remains active and operational after a system reboot.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. This is not relevant to the question as it pertains to ensuring operations continue after a reboot, not moving to another system.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the attacker has already gained initial access and needs to ensure that the malicious operations continue after a system reboot.
   - Among the given options, only "Persistence" (C) directly addresses the need to maintain access and operations across reboots.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
