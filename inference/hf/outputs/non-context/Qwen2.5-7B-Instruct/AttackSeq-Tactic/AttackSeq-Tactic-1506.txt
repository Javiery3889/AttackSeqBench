Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used tools like RDPdoor and MBR Eraser to evade defenses and maintain remote access while reducing detection risks.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid or reduce the detection of an attack. The actions described (using RDPdoor and MBR Eraser) are directly related to this tactic.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions maintaining remote access and reducing detection, which aligns more closely with Defense Evasion.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. While reconnaissance could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the actions of maintaining remote access and reducing detection.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the transfer of data from the target to the attacker. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and not directly related to the actions of maintaining remote access and reducing detection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers used tools to evade defenses and maintain remote access, which is a clear example of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - After maintaining remote access and reducing detection, the next logical step would be to perform actions that directly benefit the attacker, such as further reconnaissance, credential access, or exfiltration.
   - However, the question specifically asks which tactic most likely occurred **after** the actions of maintaining remote access and reducing detection. Since the actions described are already part of the Defense Evasion tactic, the next step would logically be another tactic that builds on this foundation.

Given the context and the options provided, the most plausible sequence would be to continue with actions that maintain the attacker's position within the network, which could include further reconnaissance or credential access.

**Final Answer: B: Credential Access**
