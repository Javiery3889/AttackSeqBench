To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **APT10 used tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation.**
   - This indicates that the initial phase involves gathering information and establishing a foothold within the network.

2. **Before conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network using Windows and open-source pentesting tools.**
   - This suggests that the next phase involves understanding the network structure and identifying valuable targets or resources.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While it is a critical step in reconnaissance, it is more likely to occur before the use of tools for reconnaissance and propagation.

B. **Persistence**: This tactic involves establishing a long-term presence on the network. It is a step that can occur after initial access and reconnaissance but before detailed network mapping.

C. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. It is a step that typically occurs after initial access and reconnaissance, but before detailed network mapping.

D. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by the defender. While it can occur at any point in the attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the sequence of reconnaissance and network mapping.

Given the sequence described, the most logical step after reconnaissance and propagation (using tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz) and before conducting internal reconnaissance to map the network would be to establish a more stable presence within the network. This aligns with the concept of persistence.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
