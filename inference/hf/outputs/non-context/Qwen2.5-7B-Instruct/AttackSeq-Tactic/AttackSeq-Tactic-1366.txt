Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Scote malware uses multiple techniques to evade detection. This indicates the use of the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
   - The malware then retrieves information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts to establish communications with its servers. This action is related to establishing a communication channel, which is a key aspect of the "Command and Control" (C2) tactic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic is about evading defensive measures, which is the initial part of the sequence described in the question.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - While reconnaissance might be involved in gathering information, the specific action of establishing communications with servers is more closely aligned with C2.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the establishment of a communication channel between the malware and the attacker's infrastructure, which matches the described action of retrieving information to establish communications.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the transfer of data from the victim's network to the attacker's infrastructure, which is not the primary action described in the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware first evades detection (Defense Evasion).
   - Then, it retrieves information from external sources (Pastebin, Google+) to establish a communication channel with its servers (Command and Control).

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware first evades detection and then uses the retrieved information to establish a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
