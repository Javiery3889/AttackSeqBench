To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Gholee's malicious macro code concatenated ASCII character codes into a single PE file**: This step involves the creation of a malicious payload.
2. **Executed it through cmd.exe /C and Rundll32 to hide the process**: This step involves the execution of the payload and hiding the process to evade detection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by the defender. While hiding the process is a form of defense evasion, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred **after** the execution and hiding of the process. Therefore, this is not the most direct next step.

- **B: Impact**: This tactic involves the actual damage or effect the attacker intends to achieve, such as data theft, destruction, or disruption. Given that the process is hidden, the next step would likely be to perform some action that achieves the attacker's objective, which aligns with the Impact tactic.

- **C: Persistence**: This tactic involves establishing a long-term presence on the network or system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after the process is hidden.

- **D: Execution**: This tactic involves running code on the target system. The question already states that the code has been executed and the process hidden, so this is not the next step.

Given the sequence of events and the options provided, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that would occur next is Impact, as it involves the actual damage or effect the attacker intends to achieve.

Final Answer: B: Impact
