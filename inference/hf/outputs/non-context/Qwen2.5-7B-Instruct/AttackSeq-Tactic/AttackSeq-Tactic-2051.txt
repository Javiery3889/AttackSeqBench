Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker has already collected sensitive data from an iOS device (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data).
   - The next step involves sending this data out via HTTP and receiving commands from the attacker.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The collection of data (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data) is a form of data exfiltration and is typically associated with the "Exfiltration" tactic.
   - Sending the data out via HTTP and receiving commands from the attacker is indicative of a Command and Control (C2) interaction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information to better understand the target. While reconnaissance might be part of the initial phase, it does not directly describe the action of sending data out and receiving commands.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the means to direct the compromised system. Sending data out and receiving commands are core activities of C2.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker developing and maintaining the resources needed for the attack. This does not fit the context of the question.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying information and resources. While discovery might be part of the initial phase, it does not describe the action of sending data out and receiving commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is "Command and Control."

Final Answer: B
