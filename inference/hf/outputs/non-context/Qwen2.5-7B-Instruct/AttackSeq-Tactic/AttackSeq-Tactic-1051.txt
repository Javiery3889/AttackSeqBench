To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The question mentions that the Taidoor malware was delivered via a spear-phishing email attachment exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158). This indicates that the adversary used a specific vulnerability to gain initial access to the target's system.

2. **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand the target environment. While reconnaissance could be a step in the process, the specific mention of exploiting a vulnerability to deliver malware suggests a more direct action towards gaining access rather than just gathering information.

3. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying assets and resources within the network. While this could occur after gaining initial access, the question does not specify any actions that would indicate the adversary is discovering assets within the network.

4. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or data. While this could be a subsequent step, the question does not mention any actions related to credential theft or access.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred before delivering the Taidoor malware via a spear-phishing email attachment exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability is "Initial Access."

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
