Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - APT10 conducted internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - This reconnaissance is a form of gathering information about the target environment, which is a typical step in the early stages of an attack.
   - The next step mentioned is leveraging shared MSP (Managed Service Provider) infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or data. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the network mapping and reconnaissance described in the question.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying assets and their vulnerabilities. The question describes APT10 mapping out the network and using tools to gather information, which aligns closely with the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that cause harm to the victim's systems or data. This is not the next step after reconnaissance but rather a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to systems. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the network mapping and reconnaissance described in the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes APT10 conducting internal reconnaissance to map out the network. This is a form of Discovery.
   - The next logical step after mapping out the network would be to use the gathered information to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, which is the essence of the Discovery tactic.
   - Leveraging shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims is a step that would follow the initial reconnaissance and exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
