Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the malware employs defense evasion techniques such as verifying Google reachability and implementing a modular design.
   - It then specifies the use of the tool 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware is using defense evasion techniques.
   - It is using 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic is not directly related to gathering information about the victim's system or evading defenses. It is more about developing and maintaining the resources needed for the attack.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining channels for the adversary to direct and control compromised systems. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the specific action of gathering detailed information about the victim's system.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary identifying and classifying information about the victim's network and systems. Gathering detailed information about the victim's system aligns well with this tactic.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid or reduce detection by the defender. While the malware is using defense evasion techniques, the specific action of gathering detailed information about the victim's system is more closely aligned with the Discovery tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware is using defense evasion techniques, which is a given and not the primary focus of the question.
   - The malware is using 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system, which is a clear indication of the Discovery tactic.
   - While defense evasion is ongoing, the specific action of gathering information is a clear step in the Discovery process.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
