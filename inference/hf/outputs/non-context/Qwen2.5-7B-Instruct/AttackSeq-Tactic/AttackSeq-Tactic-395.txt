To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic for the described sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and each answer choice step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that MuddyWater attackers used GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents to compromise initial systems.
   - This indicates that the attackers are looking for a way to gain initial access to a target system and then use custom backdoors to maintain persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (T1047)**: This tactic involves the means by which an adversary communicates with and controls a compromised system. While this is a critical part of an attack, it does not directly address the initial compromise or the use of custom backdoors.
   - **B: Initial Access (T1190)**: This tactic involves the methods used to introduce adversary access to the target environment. The use of GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents directly aligns with this tactic, as these are methods to gain initial access to a system.
   - **C: Defense Evasion (T1027)**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by the defender. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it does not specifically address the initial compromise or the use of custom backdoors.
   - **D: Reconnaissance (T1012)**: This tactic involves the gathering of information about the target to plan further attacks. While reconnaissance is a crucial step, it does not directly address the initial compromise or the use of custom backdoors.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically mentions the use of GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents to compromise initial systems.
   - These actions are directly related to gaining initial access to a target system, which is the primary focus of the Initial Access tactic (T1190).
   - The other tactics (Command and Control, Defense Evasion, and Reconnaissance) do not directly address the initial compromise or the use of custom backdoors.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
