Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary first obtained initial access through compromised VPN accounts.
   - After gaining initial access, the adversary engaged in discovery activities using tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is: 
     1. Obtaining initial access through compromised VPN accounts.
     2. Discovery activities using tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access is a tactic where the adversary tries to obtain credentials, which is a step before gaining initial access. This does not fit the sequence as it precedes the initial access.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery is the process of identifying assets and information within the network. The question mentions that the adversary engaged in discovery activities after gaining initial access, which fits the sequence.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance is a broader term that can include gathering information about the target, which can be part of the initial access phase. However, it is not as specific as the discovery activities mentioned in the question.
   - **D: Impact**
     - Impact refers to the actions taken to damage or disrupt the target's systems or data. This is a step that occurs after discovery and other activities, not before.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access through compromised VPN accounts is a prerequisite for any further activities.
   - The next step, as described in the question, is the discovery activities using tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs.
   - Among the given options, "Discovery" (B) is the most specific and directly aligns with the activities described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
