Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that DNSpionage gained initial access through spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - Before this initial access, there was a tactic that involved understanding the victims' network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets such as .gov domains and a private airline.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker acquiring and managing resources to support the attack. It does not directly relate to understanding the network infrastructure or identifying targets.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack. It fits well with the description of understanding the network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. It does not fit the context of understanding the network infrastructure and identifying targets.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves the attacker causing harm or disruption to the target. It does not fit the context of the initial reconnaissance phase.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question clearly describes a phase where the attacker is gathering information about the target network and identifying valuable targets.
   - Among the given options, only "Reconnaissance" (B) aligns with the described activity of understanding the network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets.
   - The other options (Resource Development, Privilege Escalation, and Impact) do not fit the context of the initial phase of understanding the target.

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
