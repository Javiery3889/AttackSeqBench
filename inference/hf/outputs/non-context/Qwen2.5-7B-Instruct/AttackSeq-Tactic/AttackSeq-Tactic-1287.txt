Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs involves evading detection, gathering and exfiltrating system information, and targeting FTP client credentials or VPN configurations.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred when the malware targeted FTP client credentials or VPN configurations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic is about the attacker's actions to develop and maintain the resources needed to conduct the attack. It does not directly relate to the specific actions of targeting credentials or configurations.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the attacker's actions to obtain credentials, which aligns with the question's mention of targeting FTP client credentials or VPN configurations.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the attacker's actions to avoid being detected or disrupted by defensive measures. While the question mentions evasion, it does not specifically refer to the act of obtaining credentials.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves the attacker's actions to cause harm or achieve the desired effect, such as data exfiltration. While this is part of the sequence, it does not directly address the act of targeting credentials.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the malware targeted FTP client credentials or VPN configurations, which are forms of credentials.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK tactic for obtaining credentials is "Credential Access."

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B: Credential Access
