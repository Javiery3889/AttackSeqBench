Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves social engineering to prompt targets to open malicious .src files.
   - This is followed by the execution of arbitrary code on the infected hosts.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to execute the arbitrary code.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network from an already-compromised system to other systems. It does not align with the sequence described, as the focus is on executing code on the initial compromised system, not moving to other systems.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. While initial access is a prerequisite for the described sequence, it does not directly relate to the execution of arbitrary code.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running code or scripts on the target system. This aligns perfectly with the sequence described, as the execution of arbitrary code is the next step after the initial access and social engineering.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. While it might be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate action after the social engineering and opening of the malicious files.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence starts with social engineering to prompt the opening of malicious .src files.
   - The next step is the execution of arbitrary code on the infected hosts.
   - The ATT&CK tactic that directly corresponds to the execution of arbitrary code is "Execution."

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
