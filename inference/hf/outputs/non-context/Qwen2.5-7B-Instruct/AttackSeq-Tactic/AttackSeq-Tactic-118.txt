Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions "malicious emails containing trojaned attachments" which is an Initial Access technique.
   - It also mentions "Surtr malware was executed by injecting itself into a newly created explorer or iexplore process," which is an Execution technique.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering and preparing resources for an attack. It does not fit the sequence as it is not directly related to the actions described.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves the attacker running malicious code on the target system. The question states that the Surtr malware was executed, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves the attacker causing harm or achieving the desired effect. While this could be a result of the execution, it is not the immediate step after the initial access.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target environment. The question mentions sending malicious emails, which is a form of Initial Access.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Initial Access (sending malicious emails) -> Execution (injecting malware into a process).
   - The correct sequence should be from Initial Access to Execution.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from Initial Access to Execution.

**Final Answer: B**
