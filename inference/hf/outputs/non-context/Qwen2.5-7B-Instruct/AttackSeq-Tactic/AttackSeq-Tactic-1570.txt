Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves two main TTPs:
     1. 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details.
     2. 'unactivate.vbs' exfiltrating data using a POST request.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This TTP is the final step in the sequence, as it involves the exfiltration of data. The question asks for the TTP that occurred before exfiltration.
   - **B: Discovery** - This TTP aligns with the first step in the sequence, where 'versioninfo.bat' is discovering system details.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This TTP is not directly related to the discovery of system details or the exfiltration of data.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This TTP is not directly related to the discovery of system details or the exfiltration of data.
   - **E: Defense Evasion** - This TTP is not directly related to the discovery of system details or the exfiltration of data.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs should logically flow from the discovery of system details to the exfiltration of data.
   - 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details (Discovery TTP) is the first step.
   - 'unactivate.vbs' exfiltrating data using a POST request (Exfiltration TTP) is the final step.

Given the sequence, the TTP that occurred after 'versioninfo.bat' discovered system details and before the 'unactivate.vbs' script exfiltrated data using a POST request is the Discovery TTP.

**Final Answer: B**
