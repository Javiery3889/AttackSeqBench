Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - FIN7 gained admin privileges using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT.
   - The next step is the exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target. While data collection is a crucial step before exfiltration, it doesn't directly follow the installation of a RAT and gaining admin privileges.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials. While gaining admin privileges is related to credential access, it doesn't directly follow the installation of a RAT and the exfiltration process.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection or defense mechanisms. While this could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly follow the installation of a RAT and the exfiltration of data.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the target network. After gaining admin privileges and installing a RAT, the next logical step would be to discover and understand the network and systems to identify valuable data to exfiltrate.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After gaining admin privileges and installing a RAT, the next step would be to understand the network and systems to identify what data to exfiltrate. This aligns with the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
