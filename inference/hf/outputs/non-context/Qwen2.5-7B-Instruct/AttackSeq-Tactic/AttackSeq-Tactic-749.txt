To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Gamaredon group's actions, let's break down the sequence of TTPs and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Execution**: This tactic involves the creation and running of code. While the injection of malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and the use of Outlook VBA macros to send emails are examples of execution, this does not describe a preceding step.

2. **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the gathering of information to better understand the target environment. Understanding the target's network, systems, and users is crucial before injecting malicious macros and sending emails. This aligns well with the need to identify which documents and users to target.

3. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. While this could be a step in the overall attack, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for injecting macros into documents and sending emails.

4. **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. While this is also a step in understanding the target environment, it is more focused on identifying specific resources rather than the broader reconnaissance needed to understand the network and users.

Given the need to understand the target environment, including the systems and users that would be most vulnerable, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the injection of malicious macros and the sending of emails is **Reconnaissance**.

Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
