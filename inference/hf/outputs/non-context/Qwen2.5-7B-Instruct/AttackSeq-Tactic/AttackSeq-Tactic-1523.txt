Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Whitefly leveraged network mapping and infected further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic occurred before the exfiltration of large volumes of information.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining perishable access to the target network. While it is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it typically occurs after the initial infection and before data exfiltration.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves the attacker avoiding or obscuring their presence and actions. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves the attacker moving through the network to other systems. Given that Whitefly infected further computers, this is a likely step that would occur after network mapping and before exfiltration.
   - **D: Collection**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering data from the target network. Since the question specifies that the exfiltration of large volumes of information is the next step, collection would logically precede this.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves network mapping, infection of additional systems, and then exfiltration of data.
   - Lateral movement (C) is a necessary step to infect additional systems after the initial network mapping.
   - Command and control (A) and defense evasion (B) are more general tactics that could occur at various points in the attack lifecycle.
   - Collection (D) is the step that occurs right before exfiltration, but it is not the immediate next step after infecting additional systems.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
