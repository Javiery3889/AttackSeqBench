Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers opened spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents with embedded links.
   - They utilized an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection.
   - This action is described as gaining initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence starts with the attackers opening spear phishing emails, which is a form of initial access.
   - The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection is a method to evade detection, which falls under the Defense Evasion tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution** - This tactic involves the running of code or the execution of a payload. While the use of an undocumented feature could be part of execution, the question specifically mentions gaining initial access, which is more directly related to Initial Access.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the actor's first entry into the target network. The opening of spear phishing emails and the use of an undocumented feature to avoid detection are actions that fall under gaining initial access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves the actor's efforts to avoid being detected or investigated. The use of an undocumented feature to avoid detection is a clear example of this tactic.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the actor gathering information to better understand the target. While reconnaissance might occur before initial access, the question does not mention any specific reconnaissance activities.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (opening spear phishing emails and using an undocumented feature to avoid detection) aligns most closely with the Initial Access tactic, as it directly describes the method of gaining entry into the target network.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
