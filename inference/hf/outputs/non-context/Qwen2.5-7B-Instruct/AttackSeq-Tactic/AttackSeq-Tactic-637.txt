To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for GreyEnergy's attack strategy, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GreyEnergy first achieved initial access through spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers.
   - The next step in the sequence involves targeting ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial access: Spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers.
   - Targeting: ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target network. While it is a crucial step after initial access, it does not directly explain the targeting of specific ICS control workstations.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker developing the resources needed for the attack, such as malware or tools. It does not directly relate to the targeting of specific systems.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information from the target network. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not specifically explain the targeting of ICS control workstations.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack. Targeting specific ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers would likely be a result of reconnaissance activities to understand the network and identify valuable targets.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access through spearphishing and compromised web servers is the first step.
   - The next step is to target specific ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
   - To understand and identify these specific targets, the attacker would need to conduct reconnaissance to gather information about the network and its vulnerabilities.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that informs the strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers is Reconnaissance.

Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
