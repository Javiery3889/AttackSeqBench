Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that TeamTNT downloaded and executed a coin miner payload.
   - It then states that the next step was tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution** - This refers to the act of running malicious code. The question already mentions that the coin miner payload was downloaded and executed, so this step has already occurred.
   - **B: Discovery** - This involves the attacker identifying and gathering information about the target environment. This could be relevant if the attackers needed to understand the network to use iplogger.org effectively, but it is not the immediate next step after execution.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This involves the attackers establishing a means to communicate with the compromised systems. Using iplogger.org to track infected hosts suggests that the attackers are setting up a way to monitor and control the infected machines, which aligns with the concept of Command and Control.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This involves the attackers stealing data from the compromised system. There is no mention of data being stolen or moved out of the network, so this is not the correct sequence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After the payload is executed, the next logical step would be to establish a means to communicate with the compromised systems to monitor and control them. This is best described by the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
