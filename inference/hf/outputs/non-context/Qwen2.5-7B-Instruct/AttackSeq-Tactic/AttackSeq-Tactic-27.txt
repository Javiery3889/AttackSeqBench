To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **KONNI executed arbitrary code on the victim's machine**: This action is a form of code injection or execution, which is typically associated with the "Execution" subtechnique under the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Evolving its dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions**: This action is aimed at evading detection and maintaining persistence, which aligns with the "Defense Evasion" and "Persistence" tactics.

Given the sequence, we need to identify the tactic that logically follows the execution of arbitrary code but precedes the evolution of the dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions.

- **Reconnaissance (A)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and does not directly follow the execution of arbitrary code.
  
- **Persistence (B)**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. The evolution of a dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions is a method of persistence, but it is not the immediate next step after executing arbitrary code.
  
- **Lateral Movement (C)**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. It is not directly related to the evolution of a dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions.
  
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid being detected or investigated. The evolution of a dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions is a method of defense evasion, but it is not the immediate next step after executing arbitrary code.

Given the sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurs after executing arbitrary code but before evolving the dual file structure for hiding and checking previously used versions is likely to be a tactic that involves immediate post-exploitation activities, such as establishing a foothold or ensuring the persistence of the malware.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
