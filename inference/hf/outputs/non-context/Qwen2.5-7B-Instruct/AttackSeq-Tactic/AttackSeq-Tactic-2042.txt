Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Dragonfly attackers used the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems within victim networks.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this lateral movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP mentioned is the use of the remote-desktop protocol for lateral movement.
   - The question is asking what tactic would logically follow this lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining access to the target network. While it is a common follow-up to lateral movement, it is not the immediate next step.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. The question already mentions this as the initial step, so it cannot be the next step.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves the actual damage or exploitation of the target. While it is a critical step, it is not typically the immediate next step after lateral movement.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to be used in the attack. After moving laterally, the attackers would likely need to gather more information about the new systems they have access to, making this a plausible next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of the question, is that after the lateral movement, the attackers would need to gather more information about the new systems they have access to.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: Reconnaissance.

Final Answer: D
