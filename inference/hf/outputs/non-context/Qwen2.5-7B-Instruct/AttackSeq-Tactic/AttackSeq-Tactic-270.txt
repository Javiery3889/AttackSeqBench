To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FIN8 used a malicious PowerShell command line via BADHATCH to download and execute a script for accessing networks, let's break down the sequence of actions and match them with the appropriate ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. FIN8 using BADHATCH to download and execute a script falls under this category.

2. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running code or scripts on the target system. The malicious PowerShell command line and the subsequent execution of a script to access networks align with this tactic.

3. **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand the target environment. While the script might be used for reconnaissance, the question specifically asks about the action that occurred after the execution of the script.

4. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing tools or resources to be used in the attack. This is not directly related to the execution of the script for accessing networks.

Given the sequence of actions:
- The initial access is achieved using BADHATCH.
- The malicious PowerShell command line is used to download and execute a script.
- The script is then used to access networks.

The next logical step after executing the script to access networks would be to gather information about the network environment, which is the purpose of the Reconnaissance tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the execution of the script is **Reconnaissance**.

Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
