To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely preceded the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a spear phishing document to create a malware dropper named exp1ore.exe, let's analyze the sequence of events and the corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a spear phishing document**: This step involves the attacker using a specific vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to deliver a payload (malware dropper named exp1ore.exe) through a spear phishing document. This is a clear example of an exploitation technique, but it is part of a broader attack sequence.

2. **Identifying the Preceding Tactic**: The question asks for the tactic that most likely preceded this exploitation. The exploitation itself is a result of the attacker having gained initial access to the target system or having the target's attention through some form of reconnaissance or other means.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker developing tools, resources, and infrastructure to support the attack. While this is a crucial part of the attacker's lifecycle, it does not directly precede the exploitation of a specific vulnerability via a spear phishing document.

- **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Spear phishing is a common method of reconnaissance, where the attacker tries to gather information and gain the target's trust to deliver the payload. This is a logical step that would precede the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158.

- **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining a foothold in the target network. While this is a necessary step, it is more about the entry point rather than the specific method used to deliver the payload. The spear phishing document is a method of initial access, but the tactic itself is broader.

- **D: Impact**: This tactic involves the attacker causing harm or achieving the desired effect. This is the final step in the attack sequence and does not precede the exploitation of the vulnerability.

Given the analysis, the most plausible tactic that precedes the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 via a spear phishing document is **Reconnaissance**.

Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
