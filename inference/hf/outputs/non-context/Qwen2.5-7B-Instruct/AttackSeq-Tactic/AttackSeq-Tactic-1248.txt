To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Mustang Panda Utilized the Double Extension Trick**: This is a method to bypass file extensions and execute malicious files. This is a technique used in the Initial Access phase to gain entry into a network.

2. **Delivered PlugX and Cobalt Strike Payloads**: These are both remote access tools (RATs) that are used to maintain access and control over the compromised system. This action is typically part of the Persistence phase, where the attacker ensures they can maintain access to the system over time.

3. **To Evade Security Defenses**: This is a common tactic used throughout the attack lifecycle, but it is more directly related to the Initial Access and Delivery phases, as well as the Execution phase.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the next logical step after delivering the payloads would be to ensure that the attacker can maintain access to the system, which is the Persistence phase.

**Answer Choices Analysis:**
- **A: Command and Control**: This is a tactic used to manage the compromised system, but it typically comes after Persistence.
- **B: Persistence**: This is the most logical next step after delivering the payloads to ensure the attacker can maintain access.
- **C: Initial Access**: This is the first step, not the next step after delivering the payloads.
- **D: Defense Evasion**: While this is a tactic used throughout the attack, it is not the next step after delivering the payloads.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
