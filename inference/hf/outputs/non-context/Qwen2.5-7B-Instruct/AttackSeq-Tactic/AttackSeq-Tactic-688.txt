Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with "gaining initial access via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros."
   - It then mentions "backdoor program employed persistence by writing startup items."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial access is via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros.
   - The next step is the deployment of a backdoor program.
   - The backdoor program then employs persistence by writing startup items.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This is the final step in the sequence described, where the backdoor program writes startup items to ensure persistence.
   - **B: Execution** - This would be the step where the malicious Excel document is executed, leading to the deployment of the backdoor program.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This is not directly related to the sequence described, as it involves stealing credentials, which is not mentioned in the sequence.
   - **D: Collection** - This involves gathering data, which is not directly related to the sequence described, as it does not involve the deployment of a backdoor or persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with gaining initial access via malicious Excel documents.
   - The next step is the execution of the malicious document, leading to the deployment of the backdoor program.
   - The backdoor program then employs persistence by writing startup items.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct sequence of TTPs based on the attack described is: Initial Access -> Execution -> Persistence.
   - Therefore, the answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence of TTPs is B: Execution.

Final Answer: B: Execution
