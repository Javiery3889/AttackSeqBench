To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Geumseong121 distributed the malicious app disguised as a charity service for North Korean defectors via their website and social media platforms.**
   - This step involves the initial distribution of the malicious app, which is a form of Initial Access.

2. **Before disguising the app's connection to their previously discovered malicious applications,**
   - This implies that the app has already been distributed and is now being used to establish a connection to previously known malicious activities.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration. The question does not mention any discovery of a new vulnerability or misconfiguration; it focuses on the distribution and connection to previously known malicious activities.

B. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the adversary taking steps to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be a part of the overall strategy, the question does not specifically mention evasion techniques being used at this stage.

C. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target system over time. The question mentions the app being used to establish a connection to previously discovered malicious applications, which suggests a form of persistence.

D. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target environment. The question already states that the malicious app has been distributed, which is a form of Initial Access.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be from the distribution of the malicious app (Initial Access) to establishing a connection to previously known malicious activities (Persistence).

**Final Answer: C**
