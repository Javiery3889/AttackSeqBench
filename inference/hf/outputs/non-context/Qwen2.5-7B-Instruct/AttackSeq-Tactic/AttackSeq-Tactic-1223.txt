Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes.
   - They prepared collected intellectual property for exfiltration.
   - We need to determine which tactic describes how the compromised systems maintained communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact** - This tactic refers to the actions taken to make systems or data unavailable or unusable. It does not fit the context of maintaining communication.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the theft of data from the target network. While the question mentions exfiltration, it does not describe the ongoing communication aspect.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to control and direct compromised systems. It fits the description of maintaining communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves the methods used to maintain access to the target system over time. While it is related to maintaining access, it does not specifically describe the communication aspect.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is specifically asking about the method used to maintain communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.
   - The PoisonIvy Trojan is known for its C2 capabilities, allowing attackers to maintain a persistent and controlled communication channel with the compromised systems.
   - The other options (Impact, Exfiltration, and Persistence) do not specifically address the communication aspect described in the question.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
