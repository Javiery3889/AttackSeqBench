Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Earth Lusca acquired credentials using tools like Mimikatz and the ZeroLogon exploit. This indicates a **Credential Access** tactic.
   - After acquiring credentials, the group scanned the compromised network environment with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan. This scanning activity is indicative of a **Discovery** tactic.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the target network. While scanning could be a part of lateral movement, the question specifically mentions scanning after credential access, which is more directly related to the Discovery tactic.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying assets and resources within the network. The scanning of the network environment with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan is a clear example of the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is already mentioned in the question as having occurred. The question is asking about what happened after this.
   - **D: Resource Development** - This tactic involves developing and maintaining access to the target network. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the scanning activity mentioned in the question.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, is that after acquiring credentials, the group performed a network scan to discover assets and resources within the network.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
