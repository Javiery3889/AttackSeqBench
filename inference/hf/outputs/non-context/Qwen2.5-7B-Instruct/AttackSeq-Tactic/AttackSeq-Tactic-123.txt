Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - 'Surtr' malware listing file directories.
     - Executing remote commands.
     - Logging keystrokes.
   - The malware then connected to `3-a.net` on port 9696 and downloaded a stage two component.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial actions (listing directories, executing commands, logging keystrokes) are part of the malware's initial activities to gather information and establish a foothold.
   - The final action (connecting to `3-a.net` and downloading a stage two component) is a network-based activity that suggests the malware is establishing a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying the network and systems within the network. While the malware might have discovered the network during its initial actions, the final action of connecting to a remote server and downloading a stage two component is more about establishing a C2 channel.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the actor gaining access to the target environment. The initial actions (listing directories, executing commands, logging keystrokes) are more about establishing a foothold rather than the initial access.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information from the target. The initial actions (listing directories, executing commands, logging keystrokes) are part of this tactic, but the final action of connecting to a remote server and downloading a stage two component is not directly related to information collection.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the actor using the compromised system to exfiltrate data, issue further commands, or maintain access. The final action of connecting to `3-a.net` and downloading a stage two component is a clear indication of establishing a C2 channel, which is a core part of the Command and Control tactic.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial actions (listing directories, executing commands, logging keystrokes) are part of the malware's initial activities to gather information and establish a foothold.
   - The final action (connecting to `3-a.net` and downloading a stage two component) is a network-based activity that suggests the malware is establishing a command and control (C2) channel.
   - The establishment of a C2 channel is a core part of the Command and Control tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
