Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The question mentions encrypted backdoors and loader DLLs, which are actions taken after initial access has been achieved. Therefore, Initial Access is not the next step in the sequence.

2. **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the adversary gathering information to better understand the target environment. While reconnaissance could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, the question specifically mentions actions taken after initial access, such as using encrypted backdoors and configuring loader DLLs. These actions are more directly related to maintaining access and control rather than gathering information.

3. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the adversary taking steps to avoid detection by the target's security measures. The question states that the backdoors are encrypted and the loader DLLs are configured to evade detection, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic. However, this is a step that occurs after initial access and maintaining access, not the next step in the sequence.

4. **Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining channels for control and communication with the compromised system. The question mentions that the backdoors connect to specific servers for task management, which is a clear indication of Command and Control. This is the logical next step after the adversary has established a foothold and is configuring the system to maintain access and control.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The sequence starts with initial access (not explicitly mentioned but implied by the use of backdoors and loader DLLs).
- The next step is to configure the system to maintain access and evade detection, which aligns with Defense Evasion.
- The final step, which is the most relevant to the question, is the establishment of channels for control and communication, which is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
