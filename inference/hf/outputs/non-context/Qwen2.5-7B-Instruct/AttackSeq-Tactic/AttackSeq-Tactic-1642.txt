To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before SideCopy utilized decoy documents and malicious themes to target government and military personnel through cloned websites and honeytrap-based infections, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the context provided.

1. **Decoy Documents and Malicious Themes**: This suggests that the attackers are creating convincing documents to trick the targets into clicking on them, which is a form of social engineering.

2. **Cloned Websites**: This indicates that the attackers are setting up fake websites that mimic legitimate ones to trick users into entering sensitive information or downloading malware.

3. **Honeytrap-Based Infections**: This implies that the attackers are using a combination of social engineering and malware to infect the target systems.

Given these TTPs, we need to identify the tactic that would logically precede these actions. The attackers would need to gather information about their targets to create convincing decoys, set up fake websites, and craft honeytraps.

- **Resource Development (A)**: This tactic involves the attackers gathering resources, which could include information about the targets. However, it is a broader term and not specifically about gathering information for the attack.
  
- **Collection (B)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target, which is crucial for creating convincing decoys and setting up fake websites. It aligns well with the need to understand the target's environment and behavior to craft effective social engineering attacks.

- **Defense Evasion (C)**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by the target's security measures. While this is important, it is more relevant to the later stages of the attack rather than the initial reconnaissance phase.

- **Reconnaissance (D)**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target to understand their environment and vulnerabilities. This is very closely aligned with the need to create convincing decoys and fake websites.

Given the need to gather specific information about the targets to create convincing decoys and fake websites, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred before these actions is **Reconnaissance**.

Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
