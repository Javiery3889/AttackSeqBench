To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate each step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the threat actor utilized spear-phishing emails containing spoofed banking hyperlinks to compromise victims. This is a clear indication of the **Initial Access** tactic, where the attacker gains a foothold in the target's network.

2. **Compromise**: After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to exploit the initial foothold to gain further access or control. This typically involves the attacker using the compromised system to perform actions that lead to further compromise or data exfiltration.

3. **Credential Access**: Once the attacker has initial access, the next step is often to gain access to user credentials. This is a critical step because it allows the attacker to move laterally within the network and access sensitive information.

Given the sequence of events:
- The attacker first gains initial access via spear-phishing.
- The next step would be to use that access to gain further control, which typically involves credential access.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **Execution**: This tactic involves the attacker running code or commands on the target system. While this could be a step after gaining initial access, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access via spear-phishing.

B. **Credential Access**: This is the most logical next step after gaining initial access. The attacker would need to gain access to user credentials to move further within the network and access sensitive information.

C. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attacker developing tools or resources to support their attack. This is not a direct next step after gaining initial access via spear-phishing.

D. **Initial Access**: This is the first step, not the next step after gaining initial access.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: B: Credential Access
