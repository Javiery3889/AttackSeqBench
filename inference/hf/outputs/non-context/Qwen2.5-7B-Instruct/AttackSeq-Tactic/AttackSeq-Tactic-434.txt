Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is: 
     1. Obfuscated VBScript executed using 'wscript.exe'.
     2. Communication with a C&C server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves mechanisms to maintain long-term access to a network or system. While it could be relevant later in the attack lifecycle, it doesn't directly fit between the execution of the script and the communication with the C&C server.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools. Obfuscating the VBScript and using 'wscript.exe' to execute it are both methods to evade detection, making this a strong candidate.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target environment. While reconnaissance might occur before the execution of the script, it doesn't fit the sequence described.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. The execution of the obfuscated VBScript using 'wscript.exe' is already the first step in the sequence, so this doesn't fit the gap between the execution and the communication with the C&C server.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the first step is the execution of an obfuscated VBScript using 'wscript.exe', and the next step is communication with a C&C server.
   - The tactic that best fits the gap between these two steps is Defense Evasion, as it directly addresses the methods used to execute the script in a way that evades detection.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
