Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - APT28 used the Komplex Binder to deliver the dropper.
   - The dropper was saved on the system.
   - A decoy PDF file was opened to initiate the attack.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network or system. The question describes actions that occur after the initial access has already taken place.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code or otherwise executing malware. The question mentions saving the dropper and opening a decoy PDF file, which are actions that would fall under the Execution tactic.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves the adversary gathering data from the target. The question does not mention any data collection activities.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves the adversary moving from the initial point of compromise to other parts of the network. The question does not mention any movement to other systems or networks.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The actions described (saving the dropper and opening a decoy PDF file) are actions that would be taken to execute the malware. These actions are part of the Execution tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
