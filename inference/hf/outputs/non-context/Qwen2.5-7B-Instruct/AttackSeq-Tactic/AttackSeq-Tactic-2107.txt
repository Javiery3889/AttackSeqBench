To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Malicious CCleaner binary downloaded**: This indicates that the attackers have managed to deliver a malicious payload to the target system.

2. **Redirected code execution flow to the malicious payload**: This suggests that the attackers have found a way to manipulate the execution flow of the CCleaner binary to execute their malicious code.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the attackers developing the tools and resources they need for their attack. While this is a crucial step, it does not directly relate to the redirection of code execution flow.

B. **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system. While privilege escalation can be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the redirection of code execution flow.

C. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves avoiding detection by security measures. While this can be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the redirection of code execution flow.

D. **Execution**: This tactic involves running the malicious code. The redirection of code execution flow to the malicious payload is a step in the execution process, where the attackers ensure that the malicious code is executed instead of the intended code.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible TTP that occurred before the redirection of code execution flow is the execution of the malicious code itself. The attackers would need to ensure that the malicious payload is executed, which aligns with the Execution tactic.

**Final Answer: D**
