Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described includes privilege escalation through a UAC bypass, running `cmd.exe` with elevated privileges, and executing a batch file to install the main payload.
   - The question specifically asks about a tactic that would prevent the UAC pop-up from appearing when moving files to the System32 folder.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The UAC bypass is a form of privilege escalation.
   - Running `cmd.exe` with elevated privileges is also a form of privilege escalation.
   - Moving files to the System32 folder is a step in the process of installing the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This is a tactic used to gain higher-level access but does not directly address the UAC pop-up issue.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or response by defensive measures. Preventing the UAC pop-up is a method to evade detection by the user or system.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This is not a specific ATT&CK tactic and does not fit the context of the question.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the initial entry into a network or system, which is not directly related to the UAC bypass or preventing the UAC pop-up.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The UAC pop-up is a defense mechanism that can be bypassed to prevent it from appearing.
   - The most relevant tactic here is one that involves evading or bypassing security measures, which is best described by the "Defense Evasion" tactic.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
