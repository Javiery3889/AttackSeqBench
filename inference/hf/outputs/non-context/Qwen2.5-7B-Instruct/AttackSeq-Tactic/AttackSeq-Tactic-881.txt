Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already gathered network information using ADFind and performed port scanning.
   - The next step mentioned is the propagation of beacons to other systems within the company's network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Gathering Network Information:** This is typically part of the **Discovery** tactic.
   - **Port Scanning:** This is also a form of **Discovery**.
   - **Propagation of Beacons:** This action involves moving to other systems within the network, which is a characteristic of the **Lateral Movement** tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - While discovery is ongoing, the propagation of beacons to other systems is not a discovery activity.
   - **B: Execution** - Execution typically involves running malicious code or scripts, which is not the next step after gathering information and propagating beacons.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - Defense evasion involves avoiding detection by the defender, which is not the next step after gathering information and propagating beacons.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the network, which aligns with the propagation of beacons to other systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Lateral Movement**.

Final Answer: D
