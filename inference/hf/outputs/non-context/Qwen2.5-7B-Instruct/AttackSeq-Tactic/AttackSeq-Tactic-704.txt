Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The initial TTPs mentioned are exploiting Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956) to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
   - The next step involves a Remote shell module communicating with a C&C (Command and Control) server for additional actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defenders. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the theft of data from the target. While data might be exfiltrated later, the question specifically mentions communication with a C&C server, which is not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic has already been mentioned in the question as the initial step. The question is asking about the next step, not the initial one.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining the ability to control a victim's system. The communication with a C&C server is a clear example of this tactic, as it involves the attacker sending commands and receiving responses from the compromised system.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial step involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities, which is a form of Privilege Escalation.
   - The next step is described as a Remote shell module communicating with a C&C server for additional actions. This communication is a clear example of Command and Control, as it involves the attacker controlling the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
