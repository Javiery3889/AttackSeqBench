To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: This is the tactic that describes the methods used to gain a foothold in the target's network. The question mentions that the actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks. This indicates that the initial access has already occurred.

2. **Impact**: This tactic involves the actions taken to fulfill the objectives of the adversary, such as data exfiltration, destruction of data, or other malicious activities. The question does not mention any impact activities before the initial access.

3. **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system or network. The question does not mention any activities that would require or result in privilege escalation before the initial access.

4. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to develop and maintain the resources needed to carry out the attack, such as malware, tools, and infrastructure. The question does not mention any resource development activities before the initial access.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible sequence would be that the adversary developed the necessary resources (malware, tools, infrastructure) before carrying out the initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

**Final Answer: D: Resource Development**
