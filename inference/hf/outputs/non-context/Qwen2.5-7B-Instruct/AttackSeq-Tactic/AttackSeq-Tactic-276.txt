To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before FIN8 conducted domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and gathered system information with `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs step-by-step.

1. **Domain Trust Discovery**: This involves identifying the trust relationships between domains in a network, which is a critical step in understanding the network topology and planning further attacks. The use of `nltest.exe` is a common method for this purpose.

2. **Gathering System Information**: This includes collecting details about the systems in the network, such as the operating system version, running processes, and other system configurations. The use of `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe` are typical tools for this information gathering.

Given these TTPs, we need to identify which ATT&CK tactic would logically precede these actions. Let's evaluate each option:

- **Persistence**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining long-term presence in a network. While persistence is crucial for long-term operations, it is not the immediate precursor to domain trust discovery and system information gathering.
  
- **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While lateral movement is a critical step in many attacks, it is not the initial step that would lead to domain trust discovery and system information gathering.
  
- **Resource Development**: This tactic involves developing the resources needed for an attack, such as malware, tools, and techniques. While this is important, it is more of a preparatory step and not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned.
  
- **Discovery**: This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. Domain trust discovery and system information gathering are both forms of discovery, as they involve identifying and understanding the network and its components.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the initial step would be to discover the network's structure and the systems within it, which aligns with the ATT&CK tactic of Discovery.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
