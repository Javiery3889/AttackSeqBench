Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two specific TTPs:
     - Spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages.
     - Exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into victim networks.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system or network. While it is a common step after gaining initial access, it is not directly related to the credential harvesting or server exploitation mentioned in the question.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this step.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves developing tools, techniques, and procedures to support the attack. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving from one part of a network to another, which aligns with the step of moving deeper into the victim network after gaining initial access.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages is a method of gaining initial access and obtaining credentials.
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into the network is a step that logically follows after gaining initial access and having credentials.
   - Lateral movement is the process of moving from one part of the network to another, which fits the description of moving deeper into the victim network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs and the logical flow of the attack, the most plausible sequence is that after harvesting credentials, the next step would be to move laterally within the network to gain deeper access.

Final Answer: D
