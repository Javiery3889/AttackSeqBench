Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that APT-TOCS executed Shellcode script functionalities in memory without writing to the hard disk.
   - This is followed by lateral movement within the internal network for attack operations.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not directly related to executing shellcode in memory or moving laterally.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which could be relevant to executing shellcode in memory without writing to the hard disk. However, it does not directly describe the action of moving laterally.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code, which aligns with the execution of shellcode in memory. However, it does not describe the action of moving laterally.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network, which aligns with the described action of moving laterally after the shellcode execution.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Execution (shellcode in memory) -> Lateral Movement (moving within the network).
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the execution and before the lateral movement. Therefore, the tactic that fits this sequence is "Execution" (C).

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
