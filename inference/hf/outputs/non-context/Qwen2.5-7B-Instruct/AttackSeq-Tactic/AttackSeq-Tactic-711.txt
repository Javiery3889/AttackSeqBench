To determine the most plausible next step in the attack sequence, let's analyze the given information and the options provided.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence described involves executing JavaScript and Windows executable files to install malware on the victim's system. This indicates that the malware has been successfully delivered and installed.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. Given that the malware has just been installed on the victim's system, it is unlikely that the next step would be to move to other systems.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and gathering information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. After installing malware, the attacker would likely want to understand the environment to better exploit it.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running code or scripts on the target system. Since the malware has already been installed, this step has already occurred.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While this is a common next step, it is often done after the attacker has gathered enough information about the environment.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has been installed, which means the execution phase has already taken place.
   - The next logical step would be for the attacker to understand the environment and gather information to better exploit the system, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - Lateral movement and command and control are subsequent steps but are less likely to be the immediate next step after installation.

4. **Final Answer:**
   Final Answer: B: Discovery
