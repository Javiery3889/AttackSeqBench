To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate each step:

1. **Social Engineering**: The question mentions that social engineering was used to trick victims into enabling macros within malicious delivery documents. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where the attacker manipulates the victim into taking an action that leads to the compromise of their system.

2. **Malicious Delivery Documents**: After social engineering, the attacker uses a document (likely a Microsoft Office document with macros) to deliver malware. This is a method of initial access, where the attacker gains a foothold in the victim's network.

3. **Execution**: Once the document is opened and the macros are enabled, the malware is executed. This is the next logical step after gaining initial access, where the attacker's payload is run on the victim's system.

4. **Tactics in ATT&CK Framework**: 
   - **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target's environment. This is the step where the attacker uses social engineering and malicious documents to gain a foothold.
   - **Execution**: This tactic involves the attacker running code or commands on the target's system. This is the step that occurs after the initial access, where the malware is executed.
   - **Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information to better understand the target environment. While this could occur, it is not the immediate next step after enabling macros.
   - **Impact**: This tactic involves the attacker causing harm or achieving their objective. This is a later step and not the immediate next step after enabling macros.

Given the sequence of events described, the most logical next step after the initial access (social engineering and enabling macros) is the execution of the malware.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
