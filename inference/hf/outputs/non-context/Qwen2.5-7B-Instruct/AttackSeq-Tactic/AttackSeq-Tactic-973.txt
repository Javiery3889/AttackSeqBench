To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after CosmicDuke searched for specific files, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Initial TTP**: CosmicDuke searched for files on both hard drives and network drives that matched specific patterns, including various non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers. This action is a form of data collection, as it involves gathering specific information (files) that could be used for further exploitation or analysis.

2. **Evaluate Each Option**:
   - **A: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to other systems. While searching for files could be a precursor to lateral movement, the question specifically mentions the collection of files, which is more directly related to gathering data.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary learning information about the target environment, such as network topology, systems, and users. While searching for files could be part of the discovery process, the question is more focused on the collection of specific files rather than learning about the environment.
   - **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing channels for the adversary to communicate with the compromised system. The question does not mention any communication or control actions, so this is less likely.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target environment. The question explicitly mentions searching for specific files, which is a clear example of data collection.

3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the described file search is Collection, as it directly aligns with the action of searching for and collecting specific files.

Final Answer: D: Collection
