Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The APT group used a malicious DLL payload to establish a remote connection back to a server with the IP address 160.20.147.254 on port 9999.
   - This indicates that the APT group has established a backdoor or a means to communicate with a remote server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malicious DLL payload is used to establish a remote connection, which is a form of Command and Control (C2) activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to a system. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the establishment of a remote connection.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials. Again, while it could be a step after establishing a connection, it is not directly related to the C2 activity described.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means to control the compromised system. The question explicitly mentions establishing a remote connection, which aligns perfectly with this tactic.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the establishment of a remote connection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C
