Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions "spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents to gain initial access to the victim's system." This indicates the use of a spear phishing attack and the exploitation of an OLE2 format document to gain initial access.
   - The next step is the use of an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack. While reconnaissance could be part of the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the specific TTPs mentioned (spear phishing and gathering software information).
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves the attacker running malicious code or commands. While the use of an undocumented Word feature to gather software information is an execution step, it is not the first step in the sequence.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining access to the target's system. The spear phishing emails and the exploitation of the OLE2 format document are clearly part of the initial access phase.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing a means to communicate with the compromised system. This is not directly related to the TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with gaining initial access through spear phishing and exploiting the OLE2 format document. The next step is using an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.
   - The TTPs mentioned (spear phishing, exploitation of OLE2 format, and gathering software information) are all part of the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
