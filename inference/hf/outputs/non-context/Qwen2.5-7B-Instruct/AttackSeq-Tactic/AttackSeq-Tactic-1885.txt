Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors compromised legitimate websites to host the Emissary Trojan, which allowed infiltration onto targeted systems.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial compromise and infiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Compromising legitimate websites to host the Emissary Trojan is an Initial Access TTP.
   - Infiltration onto targeted systems is a result of the initial compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves the methods, techniques, and procedures an attacker uses to maintain access to a target. While persistence is a common goal after initial access, it is not the immediate next step after infiltration.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This is the tactic used to gain a foothold in the target environment. The question already states that the initial access has occurred, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the methods used by an attacker to direct and control compromised systems. After gaining access and infiltrating the system, the next logical step would be to establish a command and control channel to maintain and control the compromised system.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the methods used to find and identify information about the target network and systems. While discovery is a common step after gaining access, it is not the immediate next step after infiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial compromise and infiltration is establishing a command and control channel to maintain and control the compromised system.

Final Answer: C
