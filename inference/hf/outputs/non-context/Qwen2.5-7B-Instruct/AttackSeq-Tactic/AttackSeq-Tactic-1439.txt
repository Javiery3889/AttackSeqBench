Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Leveraging impersonated login pages to collect credentials.
     - Redirection to a YouTube clip via a suspicious link.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the redirection to the YouTube clip.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (T1097)**: This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining the ability to send input and retrieve output to and from a compromised system. It does not fit the sequence as it is more about the control aspect rather than the initial collection of credentials.
   - **B: Reconnaissance (T1010)**: This tactic involves gathering information to be used to further an attack. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the credential collection via impersonated login pages.
   - **C: Credential Access (T1003)**: This tactic involves the adversary obtaining credentials, which fits the first part of the sequence where credentials are collected via impersonated login pages.
   - **D: Discovery (T1082)**: This tactic involves the adversary learning information about the network or system. While it could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the credential collection via impersonated login pages.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where credentials are collected first, and then a redirection occurs.
   - The collection of credentials via impersonated login pages is a direct action that fits the Credential Access tactic (T1003).
   - The redirection to a YouTube clip is a subsequent action that could be part of the adversary's strategy to maintain stealth or to further the attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that Credential Access (T1003) occurred before the redirection to the YouTube clip.

Final Answer: C
