Let's analyze the question and the sequence of TTPs step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target's network or system. The question does not mention any initial access method, such as phishing, so this is not the correct answer.

2. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target's system. The question describes a phishing email delivering a PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro, which is a form of execution. However, the execution of the VBA macro is not the final step in the sequence described.

3. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and exploiting the target's network or system. The question mentions that the VBA macro is designed to execute further malicious activities, which implies that the adversary is already in the system and is performing actions to further their objectives. This is a step after execution but before the final action of downloading and executing a dropper.

4. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing and maintaining the resources needed to carry out the attack. This is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

Now, let's put the sequence together:
- The phishing email (Initial Access) delivers a PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro (Execution).
- The VBA macro is designed to execute further malicious activities (Discovery).
- The malware then uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL (Execution).

Given this sequence, the most plausible answer is the tactic that occurs after the execution of the VBA macro but before the final execution of the dropper. This is the Discovery tactic, as it involves the adversary identifying and exploiting the target's system further.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
