To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Base64 blobs embedded in Office documents for execution**: This indicates that the attackers used a method to deliver malware through a malicious document, which is a form of initial access. This is typically done to gain an initial foothold on the target system.

2. **KerrDown DLL was dropped and executed in memory without being written to the system**: This suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers used a technique to execute the malware in memory, which is a tactic to evade detection and persistence mechanisms.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves establishing a long-term presence on the target network. While it is a common goal, it does not directly describe the sequence of actions leading to the execution of the malware in memory.

- **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attackers communicating with the compromised system to control it. While this is a common post-exploitation tactic, it is not directly related to the initial steps described in the question.

- **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the methods used to initially infiltrate a network or system. The use of base64 blobs in Office documents is a method of initial access, making this the most relevant tactic for the first step in the sequence.

- **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by security tools. While this is relevant to the execution in memory, it is not the first step in the sequence described.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence starts with the initial method of gaining access to the system, which is the use of base64 blobs in Office documents.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
