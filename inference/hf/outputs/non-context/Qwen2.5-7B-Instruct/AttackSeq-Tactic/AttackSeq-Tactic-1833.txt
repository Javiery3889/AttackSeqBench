Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Capturing credentials from compromised hotel systems.
     2. Enabling remote access to steal credit card details.
     3. Monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer to gather credit card data.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying and classifying resources and information within the target environment. While it could be part of the initial reconnaissance, it does not directly align with the specific actions of monitoring clipboard and printer data.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network or system. While enabling remote access is a form of persistence, it does not directly address the specific action of monitoring clipboard and printer data.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering information and data from the target environment. Monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer to gather credit card data directly aligns with the goal of collecting sensitive information.
   - **D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or networks. While capturing credentials is part of the initial phase, it does not directly address the specific action of monitoring clipboard and printer data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where credentials are captured, remote access is enabled, and then specific data (credit card details) is collected by monitoring clipboard and printer activity.
   - The tactic of "Collection" (T1033) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework is specifically about gathering information and data from the target environment, which matches the described actions.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
