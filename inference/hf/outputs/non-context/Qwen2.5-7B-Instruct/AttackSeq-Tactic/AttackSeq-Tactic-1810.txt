Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: persistent collection of credentials and preparation for transmission every hour.
   - The final action mentioned is the establishment of a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection:** This involves gathering the credentials.
   - **Preparation for Transmission:** This involves preparing the collected data for sending.
   - **Transmission:** This involves sending the data to an external server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves developing tools, resources, or infrastructure to support the attack. It does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering information or data, which aligns with the first part of the sequence (collecting credentials).
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to understand the target environment. While it can be part of the initial phase, it does not directly align with the sequence of actions described.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing channels for the attacker to communicate with the compromised system. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly align with the sequence of actions described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question (collecting credentials, preparing them for transmission, and then uploading them to an external FTP server) most closely aligns with the **Collection** tactic, as it involves the gathering and preparation of data for transmission.

Final Answer: B: Collection
