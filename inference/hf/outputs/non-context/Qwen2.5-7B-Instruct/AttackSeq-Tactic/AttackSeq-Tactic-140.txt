To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FamousSparrow employed Defense Evasion techniques, let's analyze the given information and the options provided.

1. **Defense Evasion Techniques**:
   - **Injecting encrypted shellcode into processes**: This technique is used to hide malicious activities from detection by security software.
   - **Obfuscating shellcode and configuration data within SparrowDoor**: This technique is used to make the malicious code harder to detect and analyze.

2. **ATT&CK Tactic Analysis**:
   - **Collection**: This tactic involves gathering information from the target system. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the techniques of injecting encrypted shellcode or obfuscating data.
   - **Credential Access**: This tactic involves stealing credentials. While it can be a goal of an attacker, it is not directly related to the techniques of Defense Evasion.
   - **Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. Techniques like injecting encrypted shellcode and obfuscating data are often used to ensure that the malware can persist on the system without being detected.
   - **Discovery**: This tactic involves finding information about the target system. While it is a common step, it is not directly related to the techniques of Defense Evasion.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The techniques mentioned (injecting encrypted shellcode and obfuscating data) are primarily aimed at evading detection and ensuring the malware can remain undetected.
   - After evading detection, the next logical step would be to ensure the malware can remain on the system over time, which is the purpose of Persistence.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the Defense Evasion techniques is Persistence.

Final Answer: C: Persistence
