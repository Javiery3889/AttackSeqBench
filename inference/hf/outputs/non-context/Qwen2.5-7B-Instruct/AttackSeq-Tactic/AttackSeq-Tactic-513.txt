Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Operation Sharpshooter**:
   - This operation is described as masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity, which is a form of social engineering.
   - The goal was to gather information for potential exploitation.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after gathering information (Reconnaissance) but before the malicious macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word (Execution).

3. **Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Impact**: This refers to the consequences of the attack, which would occur after the actual exploitation and damage. This is not the correct sequence.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This refers to the method used to initially gain access to the target environment. While this could be part of the overall operation, it is not the step that occurs after gathering information.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This is the process of gathering information about the target. The question states that this occurred before the malicious macro was injected.
   - **D: Execution**: This refers to the actual running of the malicious code. The question specifies that this step occurs after the malicious macro is injected into the memory.

4. **Reasoning**:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question is: Reconnaissance (gathering information) -> Malicious Macro Injection -> Execution (running the Sharpshooter downloader).
   - The correct tactic that fits between gathering information and the injection of the malicious macro is "Execution" because it refers to the process of running the malicious code.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
