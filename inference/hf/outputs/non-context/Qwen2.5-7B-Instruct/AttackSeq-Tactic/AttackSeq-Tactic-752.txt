To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server, let's analyze the sequence of actions involved in the described operation.

1. **Reconnaissance (Choice C)**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information to better understand the target environment. This is a crucial step before any other action, as it helps the attacker identify what to target and how to proceed.

2. **Persistence (Choice B)**: This tactic is about maintaining access to the target system over time. While persistence is important, it typically follows the initial reconnaissance and other preparatory steps.

3. **Command and Control (Choice A)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing channels to direct and control the compromised system. This is usually a step that occurs after the attacker has gained initial access and has some level of control over the system.

4. **Exfiltration (Choice C)**: This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the target system. Exfiltration is the final step in the described sequence, where the harvested documents are sent to the C&C server.

Given the sequence of actions, the most logical step that would occur before the automatic upload of harvested documents to the C&C server is the initial gathering of information about the target, which is the Reconnaissance tactic.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The attacker needs to understand the target environment and identify what documents to harvest, which is the purpose of Reconnaissance.
2. After gathering the necessary information, the attacker can then establish persistence to maintain access.
3. Once the attacker has access and persistence, they can exfiltrate the harvested documents to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
