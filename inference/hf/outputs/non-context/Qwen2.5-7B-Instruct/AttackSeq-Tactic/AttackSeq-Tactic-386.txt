Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where threat actors have acquired domain names from multiple registrars and compromised websites to support their malicious infrastructure.
   - The key actions mentioned are:
     - Acquiring domain names
     - Compromising websites

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to be used in the attack. While acquiring domain names and compromising websites can be seen as part of information gathering, the question is more about setting up infrastructure rather than collecting data.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves the initial entry into a network or system. Acquiring domain names and compromising websites are not directly related to the initial access phase, as these actions are more about establishing a foothold or infrastructure.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems or data. The actions described in the question are more about setting up infrastructure rather than moving laterally.
   - **Resource Development (D):** This tactic involves developing and maintaining the infrastructure needed to support the attack. Acquiring domain names and compromising websites are actions that directly support the development and maintenance of the malicious infrastructure.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The actions described in the question (acquiring domain names and compromising websites) are directly related to the development and maintenance of the infrastructure needed to support the attack.
   - These actions are best categorized under the "Resource Development" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: D**
