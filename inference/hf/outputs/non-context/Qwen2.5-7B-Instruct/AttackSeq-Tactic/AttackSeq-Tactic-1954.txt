Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the OceanLotus backdoor evaded defenses using robust string encoding and custom encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
   - This indicates that the backdoor has already been deployed and is communicating with the C2 server, which is a form of Command and Control (C2) activity.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This is the most direct and relevant tactic after the backdoor has been deployed and is communicating with the C2 server. The question explicitly mentions communication with the C2 server, which is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic is more about developing the tools and resources needed for the attack, which is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker learning about the target's environment, which typically happens before the deployment of the backdoor.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves the actual deployment of the malicious code or tool, which would have happened before the communication with the C2 server.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes the backdoor evading defenses and communicating with the C2 server, which is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
   - The other tactics (Resource Development, Discovery, and Execution) do not directly align with the described communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
