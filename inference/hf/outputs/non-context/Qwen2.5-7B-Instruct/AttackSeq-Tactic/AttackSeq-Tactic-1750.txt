Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The scenario describes a sequence of actions leading to the execution of the EVILNUM malware.
   - The malware is disguised as decoy business files.
   - The victim is enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key part of the sequence is the enticement of the victim to follow a link to a file hosted on a cloud provider.
   - This action is a method of gaining access to the victim's system, which is a form of initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves identifying useful information about the target's environment. It does not fit the scenario of enticing a victim to a link.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. While the malware is eventually executed, the question is about the initial step that leads to this execution.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining access to the target's network or system. Enticing a victim to follow a link to a file hosted on a cloud provider is a method of initial access.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target's system over time. It is not the initial step but a subsequent action.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Initial Access.

Final Answer: C
