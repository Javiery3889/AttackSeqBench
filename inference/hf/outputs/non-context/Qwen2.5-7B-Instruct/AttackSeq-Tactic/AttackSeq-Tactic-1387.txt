Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the Lampion trojan uses anti-debug and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection. This is a form of **Defense Evasion**.
   - The next step is to enable communication with a remote server for collecting disk details and banking credentials.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves mechanisms that allow the attacker to maintain long-term access to the target system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the communication aspect mentioned in the question.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining channels to direct and control the compromised system. The question mentions communication with a remote server, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information to better understand the target environment. While reconnaissance might be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the communication aspect mentioned.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures. The question already mentions this as the first step, so it is not the next step in the sequence.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is that after evading detection, the next step is to establish a channel for communication with a remote server to collect specific data (disk details and banking credentials). This aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
