Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the Taidoor attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities using malicious documents.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This is the tactic that describes the methods and techniques used to gain initial access to a network or system. The question already states that the attackers gained initial access, so this cannot be the correct answer.
   - **B: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to find and exploit other systems. This would occur after initial access, not before.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker identifying and classifying resources and their attributes. While this could occur after initial access, it is not necessarily the first step.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to plan and execute an attack. This is a logical step that would occur before gaining initial access.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is asking for the tactic that occurred before the initial access.
   - The Taidoor attackers used malicious documents to gain initial access, which implies that they needed to gather information about the target first.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be starting with reconnaissance to gather information, followed by the use of malicious documents for initial access.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
