Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions "process memory dumping of LSASS" and "targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting." These are techniques under the "Credential Access" tactic.
   - It also mentions "native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations." This is indicative of the "Gather Information" phase, which is part of the "Discovery" tactic.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target network. While it is a crucial part of an attack, it does not directly relate to the gathering of information or credential harvesting.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker learning information about the target network and systems. The use of native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations aligns well with this tactic.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to plan further attacks. While it is a precursor to discovery, the question specifically mentions gathering information on network and host configurations, which is more aligned with the "Discovery" tactic.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining credentials to gain unauthorized access. The question mentions techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials, which are directly under this tactic.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves credential harvesting (Credential Access) followed by gathering information on network and host configurations (Discovery).
   - The question asks which tactic most likely occurred before the use of native OS binaries and custom malware for gathering information. This implies that the information gathering (Discovery) happened after the credential access.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the "Credential Access" tactic occurred first, followed by the "Discovery" tactic.

**Final Answer: C**
