Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - OceanLotus used stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools for infecting new machines via pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks.
   - They exfiltrated data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to better understand the target. While reconnaissance might have occurred before the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining access to the target's systems. While this might be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly linked to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving across the network to other systems. The sequence of TTPs described involves infecting new machines, which aligns with the concept of lateral movement.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection by the defender. While this might be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly linked to the sequence of TTPs described.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves infecting new machines using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools. This directly aligns with the concept of moving laterally across the network to infect other machines.
   - After infecting new machines, the next logical step would be to move laterally to gain access to more systems and potentially exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
