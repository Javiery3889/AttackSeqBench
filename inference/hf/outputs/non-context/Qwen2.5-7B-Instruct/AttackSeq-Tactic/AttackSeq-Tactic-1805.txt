Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an innocuous PDF attachment was used to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, scripts and batch files were executed to prepare the attack environment.
   - Registry modifications were then made to ensure persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic is about the adversary's first step to gain a foothold in the target environment. While the question mentions initial access, it does not describe the subsequent actions that follow.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code. The execution of scripts and batch files fits this description.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic is about maintaining access to the target environment. The registry modifications mentioned in the question are a method of persistence.
   - **Impact (A):** This tactic involves the adversary causing harm or damage to the target environment. The question does not mention any impact or damage.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is the first step, which is correctly identified in the question.
   - After gaining initial access, the adversary executed scripts and batch files to prepare the environment. This aligns with the Execution tactic.
   - Finally, the adversary ensured persistence through registry modifications, which aligns with the Persistence tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves Execution (scripts and batch files) and Persistence (registry modifications).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Execution followed by Persistence.

Final Answer: C: Execution and D: Persistence
