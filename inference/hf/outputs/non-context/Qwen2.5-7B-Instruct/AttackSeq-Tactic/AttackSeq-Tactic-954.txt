To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after SWEED exploited CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document and before employing techniques such as T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) for stealth, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document**: This action is part of the exploitation phase, which is typically categorized under the Exploitation technique in the ATT&CK framework. However, this is a specific action rather than a tactic.

2. **T1107 (File Deletion)**: This technique is used to delete files to avoid detection, which falls under the Defense Evasion tactic.

3. **T1045 (Software Packing)**: This technique is used to obfuscate or compress malicious software to avoid detection, which also falls under the Defense Evasion tactic.

Given the sequence, we need to identify the tactic that logically follows the exploitation phase and precedes the use of techniques for stealth (Defense Evasion).

- **Privilege Escalation (A)**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level access to the system, which is not directly related to the use of an exploit or the subsequent techniques for stealth.
- **Execution (B)**: This tactic involves running malicious code, which is a step that could occur after the initial exploitation but before the use of stealth techniques.
- **Resource Development (C)**: This tactic involves developing and maintaining the infrastructure for an attack, which is not directly related to the immediate actions following the exploitation.
- **Defense Evasion (D)**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is the last mentioned action in the sequence.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurs after the initial exploitation and before the use of stealth techniques is Execution, as it logically follows the initial action and precedes the use of techniques to avoid detection.

Final Answer: B
