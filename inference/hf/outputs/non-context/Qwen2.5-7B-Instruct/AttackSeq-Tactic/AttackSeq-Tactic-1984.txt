To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the installation of the IEXPL0RE RAT via spear-phishing emails, let's analyze the sequence of events and the corresponding ATT&CK tactics.

1. **Spear-Phishing Emails**: This is the initial step where the attacker sends a malicious attachment to the victim. This action is part of the "Delivery" subtechnique of the "Execution" tactic.

2. **Execution of Malicious Attachments**: The victim opens the malicious attachment, which then executes the payload. This is the "Execution" tactic.

3. **Installation of IEXPL0RE RAT**: After the execution of the malicious attachment, the IEXPL0RE RAT is installed on the victim's computer. This is part of the "Persistence" tactic, as the RAT is designed to remain on the system.

Given the sequence of events, we need to identify the tactic that occurs before the execution of the malicious attachments and the installation of the RAT. The spear-phishing emails and the execution of the malicious attachments are part of the "Execution" tactic. Therefore, the tactic that must have occurred before this is the one that describes the reconnaissance and initial access to the victim's system.

4. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and understand the environment. This is a common step before executing malicious attachments and installing malware.

5. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the attacker ensuring that the malware remains on the system after initial access. This occurs after the execution of the malicious attachments.

6. **Credential Access**: This tactic involves the attacker obtaining credentials to gain access to the system. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not necessarily the first step in the sequence described.

Based on the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Discovery (to gather information and identify vulnerabilities)
- Execution (to deliver and execute the malicious attachments)
- Persistence (to ensure the malware remains on the system)

Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of the malicious attachments and the installation of the IEXPL0RE RAT is "Discovery".

Final Answer: D: Discovery
