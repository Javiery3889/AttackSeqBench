Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Compromise Domain Administrator Passwords and Gain Access to All Active Domain Accounts:**
   - This indicates that the attackers have obtained credentials and have the ability to access multiple accounts within the domain.

2. **Employ Metasploit for System Reconnaissance:**
   - Metasploit is a tool used for penetration testing and ethical hacking, but in the context of an attack, it is used for reconnaissance, gathering information about the target system.

3. **Progress Through Other Networks:**
   - This suggests that the attackers have successfully moved from the initial compromised system to other systems or networks within the same domain or across different domains.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Execution:**
   - Execution typically involves running malicious code or scripts on a system. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't directly follow the compromise of domain administrator passwords and the subsequent reconnaissance.

B. **Credential Access:**
   - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is already mentioned in the question as the initial step. Therefore, this is not the next step.

C. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the same network or across different networks. This aligns well with the scenario where the attackers have gained access to all active domain accounts and are now using Metasploit for reconnaissance and progressing to other networks.

D. **Exfiltration:**
   - Exfiltration involves the transfer of data from the target system to an external location. This is typically a later step in the attack lifecycle, after the attackers have gathered enough information or data.

Given the sequence of events described in the question, the most plausible next step after gaining access to all active domain accounts and before using Metasploit for reconnaissance and progressing to other networks is lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C**
