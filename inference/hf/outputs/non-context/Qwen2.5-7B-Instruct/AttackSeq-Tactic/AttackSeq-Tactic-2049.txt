To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the iOS malware was installed on already compromised systems but before it started gathering information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, let's analyze each step-by-step.

1. **Installation of Malware**: The question states that the iOS malware was installed on already compromised systems. This action is covered by the "Execution" tactic, which involves the running of malicious code.

2. **Gathering Information**: The malware then starts to gather information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data. This action is covered by the "Discovery" tactic, which involves the gathering of information to understand the environment and identify potential targets or data of interest.

3. **Identifying the Tactic Between Installation and Gathering Information**: The question asks for the tactic that occurs after the installation but before the gathering of information. This implies an action that is necessary to facilitate the gathering of information but is not the initial installation or the final data collection.

- **A: Execution**: This tactic is about running the malware, which has already occurred.
- **B: Resource Development**: This tactic is about developing the resources needed for the attack, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **C: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing a means of communication between the attacker and the compromised system. This is a crucial step that enables the malware to gather information, as it provides a channel for the attacker to issue commands and receive data.
- **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information, which is the final step in the sequence described.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurs after the installation of the malware but before the gathering of information is establishing a means of communication to control and direct the malware's actions.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
