Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The sequence of TTPs described in the question is:
1. Execution of PowerShell scripts via malicious Office documents.
2. Download and run of the Pupy backdoor.
3. Establishing communication with the C2 server using the obfs3 protocol.

We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between the execution of the PowerShell scripts and the establishment of communication with the C2 server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While it is a valid tactic, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
- **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves stealing credentials. It is possible that the APT might use stolen credentials to establish a foothold or move laterally, but it is not the most direct step after executing the scripts and running the backdoor.
- **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. Given that the Pupy backdoor is a remote access tool, it is likely that the APT would use it to move laterally within the network after establishing a foothold.
- **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running code or scripts on a system. The question already mentions the execution of PowerShell scripts, so this is not the next step.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The APT has already executed PowerShell scripts and downloaded and run the Pupy backdoor.
- The next logical step would be to use the Pupy backdoor to move laterally within the network, which is a common practice for APTs to expand their access and control over the network.

### Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
