Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker first exploits a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to gain initial access to a system.
   - The next step mentioned is the use of POWERSHOWER to collect system information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is exploiting a vulnerability to gain initial access.
   - The second TTP is collecting system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic is directly related to the first step of the sequence, where the attacker gains access to the system.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker learning about the network and systems, which would logically follow gaining initial access.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic is about developing tools and resources, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves avoiding detection, which is not the immediate next step after gaining access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the first step is gaining initial access.
   - The next step is collecting system information, which is a form of discovery.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred immediately after gaining initial access is "Initial Access."

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
