Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining initial access to a network or system. The question mentions Stuxnet utilizing zero-day vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, which implies that the initial access has already occurred. Therefore, this tactic is not the one that follows the privilege escalation.

2. **Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves the attacker evading or avoiding detection by the defender's security controls. While this is a common tactic used by malware, the question does not specifically mention any evasion techniques after privilege escalation. Thus, this is not the most likely sequence.

3. **Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves the attacker gaining higher-level access to a system or network. The question explicitly states that Stuxnet utilized zero-day vulnerabilities to escalate privileges. This is the first step mentioned in the sequence, but the question asks for the tactic that occurs after privilege escalation.

4. **Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves the attacker moving from one system to another within the network. The question states that the worm propagated laterally through networks by exploiting vulnerabilities such as MS08-067 and MS10-061. This implies that the attacker has already gained higher-level access (privilege escalation) and is now moving to other systems within the network.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Stuxnet utilized zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges.
- After privilege escalation, the worm propagated laterally through networks by exploiting other vulnerabilities (MS08-067 and MS10-061).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
