To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Exploitation of CVE-2021-26855 in MS Exchange to gain initial access**: This step is clearly part of the initial compromise and is a form of exploitation.

2. **Using the Windows Task Scheduler to maintain persistence**: This step is a form of persistence, as the attackers are ensuring they can return to the system even after a reboot or other security measures.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** gaining initial access and **before** using the Windows Task Scheduler for persistence. Therefore, we need to identify a tactic that logically follows gaining initial access and precedes persistence.

- **A: Execution**: This refers to the action of running code or commands. While it is a critical step in many attacks, it typically occurs after gaining access and before persistence.
- **B: Discovery**: This involves the attacker identifying and gathering information about the target environment. This is a common step after gaining access to understand the environment better.
- **C: Persistence**: This is the act of maintaining access to the target system. The question specifies that this step occurs after the tactic in question.
- **D: Reconnaissance**: This is similar to discovery and involves gathering information about the target. It is also a step that typically occurs after gaining access.

Given the sequence, the most logical step that occurs after gaining initial access and before setting up persistence is **Discovery**. The attackers would need to understand the environment to effectively use the Windows Task Scheduler for persistence.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
