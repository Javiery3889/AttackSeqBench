Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Charming Kitten developed phishing sites impersonating services like Google Drive and social networks.
   - They gained initial access through spear-phishing methods.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This typically involves the creation of tools, infrastructure, and other resources. While developing phishing sites is a form of resource development, it is more specific to the attack vector rather than a general tactic.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This involves gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and plan the attack. Developing phishing sites and spear-phishing are actions that would fall under this category as they are part of the initial planning and information gathering.
   - **C: Collection** - This involves the gathering of data from the target. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it is not the immediate step after developing phishing sites.
   - **D: Discovery** - This involves identifying the target's systems and networks to understand their structure and capabilities. This is typically a step that occurs after initial access has been gained.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after developing phishing sites and before gaining initial access through spear-phishing methods. Developing phishing sites and conducting spear-phishing are both actions that fall under the broader category of reconnaissance. Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information to understand the target and plan the attack, which includes developing phishing sites and other social engineering tactics.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
