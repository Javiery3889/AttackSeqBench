Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts by leveraging XSS vulnerabilities and Service Worker registration to inject JavaScript code.
   - This is followed by ensuring stealth by hiding their code in CSS elements.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target network or system. While hiding code in CSS elements can be a method to maintain persistence, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred after the execution of malicious scripts and before ensuring stealth.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by defensive measures. Hiding code in CSS elements is a method to evade detection, which aligns with the description in the question.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves developing and maintaining the infrastructure for an attack. This does not fit the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to be used for future attacks. This also does not fit the sequence described in the question.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves executing malicious scripts and then ensuring stealth by hiding the code. The tactic that best fits this sequence is Defense Evasion, as it directly relates to the method of hiding the code to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
