Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - This is a form of credential access, which is part of the "Credential Access" tactic.
   - They then used these credentials to perform privilege escalation.
   - After privilege escalation, they enabled their RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or removal by defensive measures. While enabling a backdoor to bypass policy settings could be considered a form of defense evasion, it is not the immediate next step after gaining domain administrator credentials and performing privilege escalation.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level access rights. The question states that privilege escalation has already occurred, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves adversaries identifying and classifying resources and information. Discovery is not directly related to the enabling of a backdoor.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - As mentioned earlier, this tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or removal by defensive measures. Enabling a backdoor to bypass policy settings is a clear example of defense evasion.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves gaining domain administrator credentials (Credential Access), performing privilege escalation, and then enabling a backdoor to bypass policy settings.
   - The enabling of the backdoor to bypass policy settings is a technique used to avoid detection or removal by defensive measures, which aligns with the "Defense Evasion" tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
