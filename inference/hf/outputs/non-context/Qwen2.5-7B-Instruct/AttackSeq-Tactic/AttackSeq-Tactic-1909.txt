Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Intercepting Customer Keystrokes and Sending Transaction Data:**
   - This action aligns with the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as it involves gathering sensitive information.

2. **Funneling Stolen Assets Through a Global Exfiltration Network:**
   - This action involves moving the collected data to a remote location, which is a key aspect of the "Exfiltration" tactic.

3. **Using Hijacked Legitimate Sites:**
   - This action is a method of maintaining or establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel, which is part of the "Command and Control" tactic.

Given the sequence of actions described, we can deduce the following:
- The initial step of intercepting keystrokes and sending transaction data is a form of "Collection."
- The next step, which involves moving the stolen assets to a remote location, is "Exfiltration."
- The use of hijacked legitimate sites to funnel the stolen assets is a method of maintaining a "Command and Control" channel.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
A. **Exfiltration**: This aligns with the next step in the sequence after collection, where the stolen data is moved to a remote location.
B. **Persistence**: This tactic is about maintaining access over time, which doesn't directly follow the exfiltration of stolen assets.
C. **Collection**: This has already occurred, as the question states that keystrokes and transaction data have been intercepted and sent to a collection server.
D. **Command and Control**: While this is a method used in the sequence, it is not the next step after exfiltration but rather a means to maintain control over the stolen data.

Based on the sequence of actions and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the most plausible next step after collection and exfiltration is the use of a global exfiltration network, which aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic.

**Final Answer: D**
