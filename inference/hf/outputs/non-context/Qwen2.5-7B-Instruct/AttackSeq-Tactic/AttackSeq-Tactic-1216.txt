Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, which involves moving from one system to another within a network.
   - They executed commands and injected processes on remote computers, which are actions typically associated with maintaining persistence and control over the compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by defenders. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the actions of executing commands and injecting processes.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the methods used by attackers to direct the actions of compromised systems. Executing commands and injecting processes are actions that would fall under this category, as they are used to control the compromised systems.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves the actions that result in the desired effect of the attack, such as data exfiltration, destruction of data, or other malicious activities. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the actions of executing commands and injecting processes.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. The question already states that lateral movement has occurred, so this is not a subsequent step.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already performed lateral movement and are now executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers. These actions are directly related to the Command and Control tactic, as they are used to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the lateral movement and execution of commands and injection of processes would be Command and Control.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
