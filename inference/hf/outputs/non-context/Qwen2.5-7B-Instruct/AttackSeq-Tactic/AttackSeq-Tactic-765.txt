Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Darkhotel APT gained initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates for hotel guests.
   - Before this initial access, the APT needed to obtain information about the victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs involves gathering information about potential victims before deploying malware.
   - This information gathering is a critical step in the attack lifecycle and is best described by the Reconnaissance tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves the development of tools, resources, and procedures used in the attack. It does not directly relate to gathering information about victims.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves the gathering of information about the target to plan and execute an attack. It aligns perfectly with the need to obtain knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods used to introduce initial foothold into the target network. While it is part of the attack, it comes after the reconnaissance phase.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the methods used to direct an attack and maintain control over compromised systems. It is not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that involves obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts is the Reconnaissance tactic.

Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
