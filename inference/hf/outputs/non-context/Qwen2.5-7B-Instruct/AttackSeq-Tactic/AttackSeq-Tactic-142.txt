Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that FamousSparrow's SparrowDoor probed files in specified directories during the Discovery phase.
   - It then asks what tactic occurred before the communication with the C&C server over HTTPS, which is part of Command and Control activities.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution** - This typically involves the running of malicious code. While it could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly follow the probing of files in the Discovery phase.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This is the phase where the attacker communicates with the C&C server. The question asks for what happened before this phase.
   - **C: Collection** - This involves gathering data, which could be a step after probing files and before communicating with the C&C server. It fits well with the idea of gathering information from the probed files.
   - **D: Resource Development** - This is more about the attacker's preparation and does not directly follow the probing of files.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The probing of files in the Discovery phase is a step to gather information about the target environment.
   - After gathering this information, the next logical step would be to collect the data that was discovered.
   - Communicating with the C&C server is the final step in the Command and Control phase, which happens after the data has been collected and is ready to be sent to the attacker.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
