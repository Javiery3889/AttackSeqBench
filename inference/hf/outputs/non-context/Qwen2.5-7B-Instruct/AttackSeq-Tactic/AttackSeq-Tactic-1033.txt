Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application.
     2. An automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining long-term presence within a network. While it is a common step after initial access, it does not directly follow the delivery of malware.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the theft of data from the target. It typically occurs after the attacker has gained access and has collected data, which is not the case here.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker's first entry into the target environment. The delivery of malware in a proprietary application is a form of initial access.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The delivery of malware in a proprietary application is a form of execution, but it is more specific to the initial phase of the attack.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application is a form of initial access, as it is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - The next step in the sequence is the automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers, which is a form of execution.

Given the sequence, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from Initial Access to Execution.

**Final Answer: C**
