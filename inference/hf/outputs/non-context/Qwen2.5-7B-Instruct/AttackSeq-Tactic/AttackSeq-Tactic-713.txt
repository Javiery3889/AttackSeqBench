Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to the target network. The question mentions that the Naikon APT group gained initial access through methods like weaponized RTF files exploiting RoyalRoad or DLL hijacking. This clearly indicates that the Initial Access tactic has already occurred.

2. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary maintaining access to the target network over a long period. While persistence is a common goal after gaining initial access, the question does not specifically mention any actions that would indicate persistence, such as creating backdoors or modifying system configurations.

3. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary learning information about the target's environment. The question does not mention any actions that would indicate the adversary is learning about the target's environment, such as using tools to gather information about the network or systems.

4. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code or commands. The question mentions that the Aria-body loader was injected into processes, which is a form of execution. However, this is a step that occurs after the initial access and is not the first step in the sequence.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is as follows:
- The Naikon APT group gained initial access.
- After gaining initial access, the next step would be to execute the Aria-body loader.

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the Aria-body loader was injected is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
