Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the threat actor gained initial access through spear-phishing emails. This is clearly a step in the attack sequence and is part of the "Initial Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Next Step**: The question then states that the threat actor ensured persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe. This is a step in the "Persistence" tactic, as it involves maintaining access to the system over time.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described in the question is:
   - Initial Access (through spear-phishing)
   - Persistence (by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe)

4. **Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary learning information about the target's environment. It does not fit the sequence as it comes after gaining access and ensuring persistence.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. While it is a step in the attack, it does not fit the sequence as it is not mentioned in the question and does not directly follow initial access.
   - **C: Persistence**: This is the tactic that fits the sequence as it directly follows initial access and involves maintaining access.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This is the first step in the sequence but not the next step after gaining initial access.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible next step after initial access is persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
