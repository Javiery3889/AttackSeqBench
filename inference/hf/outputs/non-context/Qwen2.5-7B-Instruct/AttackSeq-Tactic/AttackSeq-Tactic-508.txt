To determine the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the spear phishing attack exploiting a malicious Excel file, let's analyze the sequence of events and the provided answer choices.

1. **Spear Phishing Attack**: This is the initial attack vector where the adversary uses a malicious Excel file to deliver a payload. This is a common method to gain initial access to a target system.

2. **Payload Delivery**: Once the malicious Excel file is opened, the payload is delivered. This is a critical step in the attack sequence as it allows the adversary to execute their malicious code.

3. **Next Tactic**: After gaining initial access and executing the payload, the next logical step would be to ensure the adversary can maintain control over the compromised system. This involves establishing persistence, which means the adversary will take steps to ensure they can return to the system at a later time.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **Resource Development**: This tactic involves the adversary developing tools, resources, or infrastructure to support their operations. While this could be a part of the overall campaign, it is not the immediate next step after the initial payload delivery.

B. **Persistence**: This tactic involves the adversary taking steps to maintain access to the compromised system. This is a critical step after initial access and payload delivery, as it ensures the adversary can return to the system at a later time.

C. **Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary identifying and exploiting the target's network and systems. While this could be a step in the campaign, it typically occurs earlier in the attack lifecycle, before the initial payload delivery.

D. **Execution**: This tactic involves the adversary executing the payload or other malicious code. This is the step that immediately follows the delivery of the payload, but it does not address the need to maintain access.

Given the sequence of events and the need to ensure the adversary can return to the system, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred next is **Persistence**.

Final Answer: B
