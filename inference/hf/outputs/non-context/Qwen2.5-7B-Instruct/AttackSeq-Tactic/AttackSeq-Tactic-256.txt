To determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before UNC2452 used a supply chain compromise through a compromised software update for Initial Access in the SolarWinds Orion platform attack, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs involved in such an attack.

1. **Supply Chain Compromise**: This is a method used to gain Initial Access to a target network. In the case of UNC2452, the compromise was through a compromised software update for the SolarWinds Orion platform.

2. **Initial Access**: This is the first step in the attack where the adversary gains a foothold in the target network. The compromised software update is a method of achieving Initial Access.

Given the above, we need to identify the tactic that logically precedes the use of a supply chain compromise for Initial Access. Let's evaluate each option:

- **A: Reconnaissance**: This involves gathering information about the target to plan the attack. Reconnaissance would be a necessary step before using a supply chain compromise to gain Initial Access.
- **B: Command and Control**: This is the method used to maintain control over the compromised system. It typically occurs after Initial Access has been achieved.
- **C: Discovery**: This involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the target network. Discovery would also occur after Initial Access has been achieved.
- **D: Resource Development**: This involves developing the tools and methods to carry out the attack. While this is a preparatory step, it is not directly related to the specific TTP of supply chain compromise for Initial Access.

Given the sequence of events, reconnaissance would be the most logical step that precedes the use of a supply chain compromise for Initial Access.

Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
