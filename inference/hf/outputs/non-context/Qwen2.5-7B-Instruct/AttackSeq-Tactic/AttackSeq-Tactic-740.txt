To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each step.

1. **Initial PE created a Run key in the registry for persistence**: This indicates that the malware has established a method to ensure it runs every time the system starts, which is a form of persistence.

2. **Malware used a hijacking DLL to prepare and protect shellcode in memory**: This step involves the malware preparing its payload (shellcode) to be executed in memory, often to avoid detection by antivirus software that scans files on disk.

Given these two steps, we need to identify the tactic that logically occurs between persistence and the preparation of shellcode in memory.

- **Persistence (Tactic: Persistence)**: This is the initial step where the malware ensures it remains on the system.
- **Execution (Tactic: Execution)**: This is the step where the malware executes its payload, which in this case involves preparing and protecting the shellcode in memory.

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after persistence and before the preparation of shellcode in memory. Therefore, the correct tactic is Execution.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The malware first establishes persistence by creating a Run key in the registry.
2. The next step is to prepare and protect the shellcode in memory, which is a form of execution.
3. The tactic that fits between persistence and execution is Execution.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
