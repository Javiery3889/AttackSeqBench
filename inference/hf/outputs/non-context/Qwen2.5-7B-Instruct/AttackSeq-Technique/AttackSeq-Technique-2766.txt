To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The question mentions embedding a MoonBounce implant in the UEFI firmware, which is a sophisticated method to maintain persistence.
   - The attackers then set hooks in the firmware's execution phase to divert functions to malicious shellcode during the boot sequence.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs:**
   - **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service:** This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malware through a service. It does not directly relate to embedding malware in firmware or setting hooks in the boot sequence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed during the boot process or when a user logs on. While it is related to the boot sequence, it does not specifically address the embedding of malware in firmware.
   - **T1090.001-Internal Proxy:** This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic through a malicious proxy. It is not relevant to the context of embedding malware in firmware or setting hooks in the boot sequence.
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party product or service to deliver malware. It can be a method to initially compromise a system, which could then lead to the embedding of malware in firmware and setting hooks in the boot sequence.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers need to initially compromise the system to gain the ability to modify the firmware.
   - Supply chain compromise (T1195) is a plausible method to initially compromise a system, which could then lead to the embedding of malware in the firmware and setting hooks in the boot sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
