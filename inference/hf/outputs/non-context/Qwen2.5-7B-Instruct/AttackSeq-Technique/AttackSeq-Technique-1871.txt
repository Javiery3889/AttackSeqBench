To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Technique**: APT28 used DDE in Office products to fetch and execute a payload via PowerShell. This is a method of initial access where the attacker uses a legitimate feature of the software to execute malicious code.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: The payload was executed via PowerShell, which is a scripting interpreter that can be used to run commands and scripts on a system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. Since the payload was executed via PowerShell, this is a relevant technique. However, it is more of a method of execution rather than a specific step that follows the initial access.

B. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While this could be a method used to deliver the initial payload, it is not directly related to the execution of the payload via DDE and PowerShell.

C. **T1553.003-SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) or trust provider to gain unauthorized access. This is not directly related to the DDE and PowerShell execution sequence.

D. **T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM) Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking the Component Object Model to execute arbitrary code. This is closely related to the use of DDE, as DDE can be used to execute code through COM objects. After the initial access via DDE and PowerShell, hijacking the COM model to execute the payload is a plausible next step.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible next step after using DDE and PowerShell to execute a payload would be to hijack the COM model to ensure the persistence and execution of the payload.

**Final Answer: D**
