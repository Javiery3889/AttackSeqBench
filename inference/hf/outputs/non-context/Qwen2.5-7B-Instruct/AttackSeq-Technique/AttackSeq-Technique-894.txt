To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that after the C&C infrastructure was disrupted, the attackers likely used antivirus detection checks for Defense Evasion.
   - This implies that the attackers needed to find a way to bypass the newly disrupted C&C infrastructure and the antivirus systems in place.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1591.003-Identify Business Tempo**
     - This technique involves understanding the normal business operations to avoid detection. While it could be part of the attackers' strategy, it does not directly relate to bypassing C&C infrastructure or antivirus detection.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection by antivirus software. This aligns well with the need to bypass antivirus detection after the C&C infrastructure was disrupted.
   - **C: T1003.003-NTDS**
     - This technique involves accessing NTDS.dit files, which are used to extract user account information from Active Directory. This is more about data exfiltration or lateral movement rather than directly related to bypassing antivirus or C&C infrastructure.
   - **D: T1036.006-Space after Filename**
     - This technique involves using a space after a filename to bypass antivirus software. This is a specific method to evade antivirus detection, which aligns well with the need to bypass antivirus after the C&C infrastructure was disrupted.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers need to bypass the newly disrupted C&C infrastructure and the antivirus systems.
   - T1027 (Obfuscation) and T1036.006 (Space after Filename) are both directly related to bypassing antivirus detection.
   - T1027 (Obfuscation) is a broader technique that can include various methods, including the specific method mentioned in T1036.006.
   - T1003.003 (NTDS) is not directly related to bypassing antivirus or C&C infrastructure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the need to bypass antivirus detection after the C&C infrastructure was disrupted, is T1027 (Obfuscation) as it encompasses the specific method mentioned in T1036.006.
   
Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
