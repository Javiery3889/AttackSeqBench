To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions "coordinated command and control to facilitate ATM withdrawals with physical mules." This indicates that the attackers have already gained control over the systems and are using this control to perform ATM withdrawals.
   - The final step described is "manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains."

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves deploying software to a target system. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly align with the final manipulation of internal systems for financial gain.
   - **B: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery:** This technique involves actions that prevent the system from recovering after an attack. While this could be a step to maintain persistence, it does not directly align with the final manipulation of internal systems for financial gain.
   - **C: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves the theft of funds from a financial institution. Given that the attackers have already facilitated ATM withdrawals, this technique directly aligns with the final step of enabling unauthorized financial gains.
   - **D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets:** This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access. While this could be a method to maintain access, it does not directly align with the final step of manipulating internal systems for financial gain.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers have already facilitated ATM withdrawals, indicating they have control over the systems and can perform actions that result in financial gain.
   - The final step described is the manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.
   - Among the given options, T1657-Financial Theft (C) is the most direct and relevant technique for the final step of enabling unauthorized financial gains.

**Final Answer: C: T1657-Financial Theft**
