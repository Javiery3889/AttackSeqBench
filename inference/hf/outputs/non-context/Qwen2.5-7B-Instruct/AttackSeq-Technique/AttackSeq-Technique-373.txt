Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Exploiting the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2012-0158**: This is the initial access technique, which is not directly relevant to the execution strategy of BBSRAT.

2. **Gaining execution capabilities with BBSRAT via process hollowing**: This indicates that BBSRAT is using a technique to inject its code into a legitimate process to avoid detection. Process hollowing is a technique where an attacker replaces the legitimate code of a process with malicious code.

3. **Leveraging legitimate Citrix executable ssonsvr.exe**: The question specifies that BBSRAT is using the Citrix executable `ssonsvr.exe` as a legitimate process to inject its malicious code.

4. **Identifying the most plausible ATT&CK technique**: We need to find a technique that aligns with the use of a legitimate process to execute malicious code.

- **T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence or execute code. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly address the use of a specific executable for injection.
  
- **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to deploy malicious software. It doesn't directly relate to the use of a specific executable for injection.
  
- **T1542-Pre-OS Boot**: This technique involves modifying the boot process to gain early execution. It doesn't align with the use of a specific executable for injection.
  
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malicious code is executed when a user logs on or the system boots. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly address the use of a specific executable for injection.

Given the context of using `ssonsvr.exe` as a legitimate process to inject malicious code, the most relevant ATT&CK technique is one that directly addresses the use of a specific process for execution. The closest match is:

**T1569-System Services**, as it involves using system services, which can include legitimate executables like `ssonsvr.exe`, to execute malicious code.

Final Answer: A: T1569-System Services
