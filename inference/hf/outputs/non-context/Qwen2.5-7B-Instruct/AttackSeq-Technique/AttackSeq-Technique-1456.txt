To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
- **GADOLINIUM** used open-source tools and cloud services for **defense evasion**.
- The goal was to **set up a malicious infrastructure** that can be **quickly established and dismantled**.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL**
- This technique involves using the `netsh` command to create a helper DLL that can be used to execute arbitrary code. While it is a method for persistence and execution, it does not directly align with the quick establishment and dismantling of a malicious infrastructure.

**B: T1566-Phishing**
- Phishing involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. This technique is more about social engineering and does not directly relate to the quick setup and dismantling of a malicious infrastructure.

**C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
- This technique involves maintaining access to a target by using multiple methods or fallbacks. It is useful for ensuring persistence and maintaining access even if one method is detected and mitigated. However, it does not directly address the quick establishment and dismantling of a malicious infrastructure.

**D: T1090-Proxy**
- This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary, which can be used to bypass network security controls and maintain access. While it is a method for maintaining access, it does not directly relate to the quick establishment and dismantling of a malicious infrastructure.

### Reasoning:
- The scenario describes the use of open-source tools and cloud services for defense evasion to set up a malicious infrastructure that can be quickly established and dismantled. This implies a need for a method that can rapidly deploy and remove components of the infrastructure.
- **T1008-Fallback Channels** (C) is the closest to the scenario as it involves maintaining access through multiple methods, which could include quickly setting up and removing components of the infrastructure.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1008-Fallback Channels
