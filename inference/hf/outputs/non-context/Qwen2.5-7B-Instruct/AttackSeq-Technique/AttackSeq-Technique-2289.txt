To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Identify the Context**: The question mentions that Regin first gathered information on processes and memory utilization, and then monitored network traffic for IIS web servers. This indicates that Regin is already in a phase of reconnaissance and information gathering.

2. **Evaluate Each Option**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through a third party. While this could be a method to monitor or manipulate network traffic, it is not directly related to the specific actions of gathering process and memory information or monitoring IIS web servers.
   - **B: T1112-Modify Registry**: This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to persist or alter system behavior. While this could be a step in the attack chain, it does not directly relate to the gathering of process and memory information or monitoring IIS web servers.
   - **C: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the gathering of process and memory information or monitoring IIS web servers.
   - **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections and services, which aligns with the monitoring of network traffic for IIS web servers. It is a logical step after gathering process and memory information, as it helps in identifying and targeting specific services or protocols.

3. **Reasoning**:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves gathering information on processes and memory, and then monitoring network traffic for IIS web servers. T1049-System Network Connections Discovery (T1049) is the most relevant technique as it directly relates to the monitoring of network traffic and identifying specific services like IIS.

**Final Answer: D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
