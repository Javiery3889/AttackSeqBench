Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Reconnaissance Spear Phishing with a Remote Template to Deliver a Payload:**
   - This indicates that the attackers first conducted reconnaissance to identify targets and then used spear phishing with a remote template to deliver a payload. This is a common initial attack vector.

2. **CVE-2017-11882:**
   - This is a specific Office vulnerability that was exploited to gain access. The question specifies that this is a year-old vulnerability, which means it is an older known vulnerability that was leveraged in the attack.

3. **Gaining Access:**
   - The attackers used this vulnerability to gain access to the target system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
   - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it could be relevant, the question specifies an Office vulnerability, which is not a public-facing application but rather a component of the target's system.

B. **T1598-Phishing for Information:**
   - This technique involves using phishing to obtain information. While the spear phishing is part of the initial attack, this technique does not directly address the exploitation of the Office vulnerability.

C. **T1134.002-Create Process with Token:**
   - This technique involves creating a process with a token to gain elevated privileges. This is not directly related to exploiting the Office vulnerability.

D. **T1133-External Remote Services:**
   - This technique involves using external remote services to gain access. This is not directly related to the exploitation of the Office vulnerability either.

Given the context of the question, the most relevant technique is the one that directly addresses the exploitation of the Office vulnerability to gain access. The correct answer should be the one that aligns with the exploitation of a specific vulnerability in a specific application (in this case, Office).

**Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question. While it is not a perfect match, it is the closest to the context of exploiting a specific vulnerability in an application.
