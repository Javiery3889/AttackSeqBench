Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving SparrowDoor.
   - SparrowDoor is used to read file contents for data collection.
   - After data collection, communication with the C&C server occurs.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely used for this C&C communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1055-Process Injection** - This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or modify its behavior. It does not directly relate to the communication with the C&C server.
   - **B: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations** - This technique involves determining the physical location of a target. It is not relevant to the communication with the C&C server.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encryption to secure the communication channel between the attacker and the C&C server. This is a plausible method for securing the data exfiltration process.
   - **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling** - This technique involves using one protocol to hide the use of another protocol. While it can be used to secure communication, it is not as directly relevant to the specific context of encrypted channel communication as T1573.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that SparrowDoor is used for data collection and that the next step is communication with the C&C server.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for securing this communication would be one that ensures the data exfiltration is not easily detected or intercepted.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel directly addresses the need for secure communication, which aligns with the context of exfiltrating data over a C&C channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
