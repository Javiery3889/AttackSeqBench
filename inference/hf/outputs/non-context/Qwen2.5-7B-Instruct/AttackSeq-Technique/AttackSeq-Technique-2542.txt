To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Deep Panda used the Fire Chili kernel rootkit**:
   - This rootkit employs **Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM)** and **Themida packing**.
   - The primary goal of these techniques is to hide malicious artifacts and evade detection.

2. **Identify the next likely TTP**:
   - After hiding malicious artifacts, the next step would typically be to ensure that these artifacts remain hidden and undetected.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**:
   - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts.
   - While this could be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the hiding of artifacts.

B. **T1011.001-Exfiltration Over Bluetooth**:
   - This technique involves exfiltrating data over Bluetooth.
   - This is not directly related to hiding artifacts and is more about data exfiltration.

C. **T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**:
   - This technique involves disabling or modifying the system firewall to allow malicious traffic.
   - While this could be a step in the attack, it is more about evading detection rather than hiding artifacts.

D. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**:
   - This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious files, processes, or network connections.
   - This directly follows the use of DKOM and Themida packing to hide artifacts and evade detection.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible next step after hiding artifacts would be to ensure that these hidden artifacts remain undetected. Therefore, the most appropriate TTP is to continue hiding the artifacts.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
