To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The question mentions that the Shellbot has already discovered monitoring tools and host information.
   - The next step is establishing persistent communication with the C&C servers via IRC.
   - We need to identify a TTP that logically follows the discovery of monitoring tools and host information but precedes the establishment of persistent communication.

2. **Analyzing Each Option:**
   - **A: T1518-Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating software on the target system. While it is a discovery technique, it is more about identifying software rather than establishing communication.
   - **B: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning the target system for vulnerabilities. It is a step that can occur after software discovery but is not directly related to establishing communication.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying services running on the target system. It is a step that can follow software discovery and is relevant to understanding the network environment, which is necessary for establishing communication.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, processes, and registry entries to avoid detection. It is a defensive measure and does not directly relate to the sequence of establishing communication.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After discovering monitoring tools and host information, the next logical step would be to understand the network services running on the target system. This would help the attacker in identifying potential communication channels, such as IRC, to establish persistent communication.
   - Network service discovery (T1046) is a critical step in understanding the target's network environment, which is necessary before establishing persistent communication.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that after discovering monitoring tools and host information, the next step would be to discover network services.

Final Answer: C: T1046-Network Service Discovery
