To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Initial TTPs Mentioned:**
   - Network share, process, and system network configuration discovery.
   - Use of WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) for discovery.
   - Compromised router virtual machines for lateral movement.

2. **Objective:**
   - The objective is to identify potential new targets for lateral movement.

3. **Analyzing Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about system owners and users, which is a form of reconnaissance. However, it does not directly align with the objective of identifying new targets for lateral movement.
   - **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves archiving data that has been collected. It is not directly related to the next step in the attack sequence after discovery and identification of new targets.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering services running on a network, which is a step in identifying potential new targets for lateral movement. It aligns well with the objective of finding new targets.
   - **D: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
     - This technique involves preparing the environment for further attacks, which is a step that typically comes after identifying and compromising new targets. It is not the immediate next step after discovery.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to first discover potential new targets (T1046-Network Service Discovery) and then use those targets for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
