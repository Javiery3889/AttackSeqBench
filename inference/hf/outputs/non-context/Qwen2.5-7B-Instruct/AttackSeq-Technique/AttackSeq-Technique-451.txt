To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Geumseong121 used a technique to distribute a malicious app through a charity website, and then employed Defense Evasion tactics by disguising the app as unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves copying files to removable media, which is not directly related to distributing an app through a website.
   - **B: T1037.001-Logon Script (Windows):** This technique involves using logon scripts to execute malicious code, which is not directly related to the distribution of an app through a website.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system without their interaction, typically through a malicious website. This could be a plausible method for distributing a malicious app through a charity website.
   - **D: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites:** This technique involves searching for and compromising websites that the victim frequently visits. While this could be a part of the overall strategy, it does not directly describe the method of distributing the malicious app through a specific website.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the malicious app was distributed through a charity website. This implies that the initial compromise of the victim's device would likely occur through a website visit.
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise (C) directly involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website, which aligns with the scenario of distributing a malicious app through a charity website.

**Final Answer: C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
