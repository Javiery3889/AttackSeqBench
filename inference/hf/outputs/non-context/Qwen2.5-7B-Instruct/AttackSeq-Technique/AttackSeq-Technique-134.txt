To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT-TOCS evaded detection by executing malicious code in memory and running multi-beacon communication, we need to analyze the sequence of TTPs and match them with the provided answer choices.

1. **APT-TOCS Evaded Detection by Executing Malicious Code in Memory:**
   - This indicates the use of in-memory execution, which is a common technique to avoid detection by traditional disk-based antivirus solutions.

2. **Running Multi-Beacon Communication:**
   - This suggests the use of a communication channel that frequently changes or is highly dynamic, which is a tactic to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1106-Native API:**
   - This technique involves using native Windows APIs to perform actions, which can be used to execute code in memory. It aligns well with the in-memory execution aspect.

B. **T1059.009-Cloud API:**
   - This technique involves using cloud APIs to perform actions. While it can be used for communication, it does not directly align with in-memory execution.

C. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
   - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. It is more about gaining initial access rather than executing code in memory or maintaining persistence through multi-beacon communication.

D. **T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes:**
   - This technique involves manipulating file attributes on the NTFS file system. It is not directly related to in-memory execution or multi-beacon communication.

Given the need for in-memory execution and multi-beacon communication, the most plausible sequence would start with a technique that facilitates in-memory execution, which is best represented by T1106-Native API.

**Final Answer: A: T1106-Native API**
