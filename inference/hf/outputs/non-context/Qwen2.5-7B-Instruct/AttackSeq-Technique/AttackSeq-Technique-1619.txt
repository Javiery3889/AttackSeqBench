Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT28 ensures persistence by altering the timestamps of files downloaded by the second stage dropper to conceal them from victims.
   - This indicates a technique for hiding or removing indicators of compromise (IoCs) from the system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to altering file timestamps or hiding files.
   - **B: T1218.013-Mavinject** - This technique involves using MAPI (Message Application Programming Interface) to inject code into email messages. It is not related to altering file timestamps or hiding files.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal** - This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise. This aligns with the scenario where timestamps are altered to hide files from the victims.
   - **D: T1546.017-Udev Rules** - This technique involves using udev rules to create persistent device nodes. While it can be used for persistence, it does not directly relate to altering file timestamps or hiding files.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions altering file timestamps to hide files from the victims.
   - T1070-Indicator Removal (Choice C) is the most relevant technique as it encompasses the removal or obfuscation of indicators, which includes altering file timestamps to hide files.

**Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
