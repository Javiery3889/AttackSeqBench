To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for ProjectM's development of its capabilities after conducting reconnaissance, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Initial TTPs:** ProjectM conducted reconnaissance by targeting Indian government and military personnel using spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites.
   - **Objective:** Develop its capabilities based on the gathered information.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1543.005-Container Service:** This TTP involves the use of container services to host malicious code or to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the development of capabilities based on reconnaissance.
   - **B: T1584.008-Network Devices:** This TTP involves the use of network devices to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It also does not directly relate to the development of capabilities based on reconnaissance.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This TTP directly involves the development of capabilities based on the information gathered from reconnaissance. It aligns with the objective of ProjectM after conducting reconnaissance.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This TTP involves gathering specific information about the victims, which is part of the reconnaissance phase, not the development of capabilities.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question states that ProjectM conducted reconnaissance using spear-phishing and watering hole sites. This is a form of gathering information about potential targets.
   - The next logical step after gathering this information would be to use that information to develop capabilities. This is precisely what T1587-Develop Capabilities (C) describes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: C: T1587-Develop Capabilities
