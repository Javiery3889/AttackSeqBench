Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with downloading and running the Pierogi backdoor via an embedded macro in a Microsoft Word document.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure the backdoor runs upon user login.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The goal is to ensure the backdoor runs automatically when the user logs in.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL:** This technique involves using a Terminal Services (RDP) service to load a DLL. It is not directly related to ensuring a backdoor runs on login.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves adding a file to a location that is executed when the system boots or when a user logs in. This aligns with the goal of ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.
   - **C: T1098.005-Device Registration:** This technique involves registering a device with a remote system. It is not related to ensuring a backdoor runs on login.
   - **D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service. It is not related to ensuring a backdoor runs on login.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs to ensure the backdoor runs upon user login is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

Final Answer: B
