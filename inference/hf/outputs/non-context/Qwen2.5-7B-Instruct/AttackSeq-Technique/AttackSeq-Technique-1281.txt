Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The initial access was gained through Tropic Trooper exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).
   - The next step involves the execution of a backdoor's installer.
   - The installer's deployment is triggered by users' actions or interactions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the scenario of user interaction triggering the deployment of a backdoor's installer.
   - **B: T1564.009-Resource Forking** - This technique is related to the manipulation of file metadata, which is not directly related to user interaction triggering the deployment of a backdoor's installer.
   - **C: T1648-Serverless Execution** - This technique involves executing code without a traditional server-client relationship, which is not directly related to user interaction triggering the deployment of a backdoor's installer.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves the attacker leveraging a user's action or interaction to execute malicious code. This aligns perfectly with the scenario where the backdoor's installer is deployed based on user interaction.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the backdoor's installer is deployed based on user interaction, which is a clear match for the T1204-User Execution technique.
   - T1573, T1564.009, and T1648 do not align with the described user interaction scenario.

**Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution**
