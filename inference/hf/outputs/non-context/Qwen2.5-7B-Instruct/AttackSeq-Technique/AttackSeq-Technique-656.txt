Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The question mentions that Gallmaker exploited the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory and gained initial access to the victim's device using malicious Office documents.
   - This indicates that the attacker used a technique to execute code in memory and gain initial access.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. It does not directly follow the exploitation of DDE for in-memory execution and gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. After gaining initial access and executing commands in memory, the next step would likely be to use a command interpreter to run additional commands or scripts.
   - **C: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a physical medium, which is not directly related to the initial exploitation and in-memory execution.
   - **D: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
     - This technique involves using DDE to exchange data, which is already mentioned in the question as the initial exploitation method. It does not represent a subsequent step.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After gaining initial access and executing commands in memory, the next logical step would be to use a command interpreter to run additional commands or scripts to maintain persistence, gather information, or perform further actions.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
