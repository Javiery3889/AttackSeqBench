Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that MuddyWater exploited CVE-2017-0199 through decoy documents to gain initial access. This is a common technique for initial compromise.

2. **Communication with Compromised Servers**: The question states that MuddyWater initiated communication with compromised servers to host and transfer malicious code. This indicates that the attackers are establishing a command and control (C2) channel to manage the compromised system and deliver further payloads.

3. **Second Stage of Attacks**: The question specifies that this communication is part of the second stage of attacks, implying that the initial stage involved gaining access, and now the attackers are moving to the next phase of the attack.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel between the attacker and the victim. While this could be part of the C2 communication, it does not specifically address the transfer of malicious code.

B. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. This does not align with the question, as the focus is on communication and code transfer, not on exploiting another application.

C. **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or malware from an external source to the victim's network. This aligns well with the question, as it describes the transfer of malicious code to the compromised system.

D. **T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**: This technique involves manipulating data transfer size limits to evade detection. While this could be a tactic used during the data transfer, it does not directly address the transfer of malicious code.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the transfer of malicious code to the compromised system, which aligns with the Ingress Tool Transfer technique.

**Final Answer: C**
