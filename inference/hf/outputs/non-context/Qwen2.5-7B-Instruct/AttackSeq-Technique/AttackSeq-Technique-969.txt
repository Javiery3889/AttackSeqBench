To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Aria-body backdoor collected extensive system information such as host-name, username, and system architecture.**
   - This indicates that the attacker has already gathered basic system details.

2. **Before engaging in the collection of file metadata and taking screenshots.**
   - This suggests that the next step involves gathering more detailed information about the system's files and possibly visual data.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1614-System Location Discovery**
   - This technique involves identifying the geographical location of the target system. While it is a relevant technique, it is not directly related to the collection of file metadata or taking screenshots.

B. **T1087-Account Discovery**
   - This technique involves identifying valid accounts on the target system. This is a logical step after collecting basic system information and before gathering file metadata and taking screenshots, as it helps the attacker to understand the user environment and potentially gain access to more sensitive information.

C. **T1205.001-Port Knocking**
   - This technique involves using a specific sequence of port knocks to establish a connection. It is not directly related to the collection of file metadata or taking screenshots.

D. **T1573-Encrypted Channel**
   - This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel to maintain persistence and confidentiality. While it is important for maintaining the backdoor, it is not directly related to the collection of file metadata or taking screenshots.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible step after collecting basic system information and before engaging in the collection of file metadata and taking screenshots is to discover valid accounts on the system.

**Final Answer: B (T1087-Account Discovery)**
