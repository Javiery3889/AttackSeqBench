To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Turla's RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor used plugins for lateral movement and control within the local network by monitoring USB drives, we need to analyze the sequence of actions that would logically precede such a sophisticated lateral movement technique.

1. **T1588.002-Tool**: This technique involves the use of tools to perform actions that are not directly supported by the operating system. While this could be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the initial step that would enable monitoring USB drives.

2. **T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the Windows registry to gather information about the system. While this could be used to gather information that might help in identifying USB drives, it is not the most direct precursor to monitoring USB drives.

3. **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves discovering and enumerating peripheral devices, such as USB drives, to gather information about the environment. This is a direct precursor to monitoring USB drives, as it would enable the attacker to identify and target USB drives for monitoring.

4. **T1037-Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts**: This technique involves using scripts to execute code during the boot or logon process. While this could be used to establish persistence or to run other malicious scripts, it does not directly address the discovery and monitoring of USB drives.

Given the need to discover and monitor USB drives, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would start with discovering the peripheral devices, which is directly addressed by T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
