Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two key TTPs:
     - Discovery of system network configurations using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.
     - Exfiltration of locally collected data using a backdoor function.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
     - This technique involves using a network provider DLL to establish a covert channel. It is more about establishing a communication channel rather than directly exfiltrating data.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves accessing data from the local system. While it could be relevant, it does not directly align with the exfiltration of data using a backdoor function.
   - **C: T1123-Audio Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing audio data. It is not relevant to the context of network configuration discovery or data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Given that the question mentions using a backdoor function to exfiltrate data, this technique aligns well with the exfiltration step.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves discovering network configurations and then exfiltrating data. The exfiltration step is the last in the sequence, and the most relevant technique for this step is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
