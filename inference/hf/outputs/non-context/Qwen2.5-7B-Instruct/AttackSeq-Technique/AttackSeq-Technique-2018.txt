Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Welcome Chat app collects device information, including GPS location.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The app has already collected device information.
   - The next step is to ensure the app runs automatically at startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**
     - This technique involves using a specific URL (Mark-of-the-Web) to bypass security controls. It does not relate to ensuring an app runs at startup.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that a malicious program is executed when the system boots up or when a user logs on. This aligns with the requirement to ensure the app runs automatically at startup.
   - **C: T1546.014-Emond**
     - This technique involves using a specific file format (Emond) to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to ensuring an app runs at startup.
   - **D: T1125-Video Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing video from a device's camera. It does not relate to ensuring an app runs at startup.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the app has already collected device information and now needs to ensure it runs automatically at startup.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (B) is the only technique that directly addresses the requirement to ensure the app runs automatically at startup.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
