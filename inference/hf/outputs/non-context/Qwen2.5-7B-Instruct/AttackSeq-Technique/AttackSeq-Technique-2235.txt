To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the answer choices.

1. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - The malware, Grabit, has established persistence by modifying common registry entries with startup configurations. This means the malware ensures it runs every time the system starts up, maintaining its foothold.

2. **Answer Choices Evaluation**:
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to steal sensitive information. While it could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the persistence mechanism described.
   - **B: T1003.003-NTDS**: This technique involves accessing the Active Directory database, specifically the NTDS.dit file, to extract user credentials and other sensitive information. This is a significant step after persistence has been established, as it allows the attacker to gain deeper access to the network.
   - **C: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**: This technique involves changing the default file associations to execute malicious code when a user opens a file. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the persistence mechanism described.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. This is a common initial step but does not directly follow the persistence mechanism described.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The malware has already established persistence, meaning it will run every time the system starts.
   - The next logical step would be to leverage this persistence to gain deeper access to the system or network.
   - Accessing the NTDS.dit file (T1003.003) would allow the attacker to extract user credentials and other sensitive information, which is a significant step after persistence has been established.

**Final Answer: B: T1003.003-NTDS**
