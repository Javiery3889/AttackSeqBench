Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The JavaScript file created an executable ('d3reEW.exe') to discover IP address information using the command 'cmd /c ipconfig'.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is the creation of an executable to gather IP address information.
   - The next step is enabling HTTPS communication with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a command and control channel. HTTPS is an application layer protocol, so this could be relevant.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run at a later time. It does not directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass network security controls. It does not directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering available internet connections. It does not directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is specifically about enabling HTTPS communication with the C&C server.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant technique as it directly involves the use of HTTPS, which is an application layer protocol.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
