Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - APT42 conducts reconnaissance by browsing the compromised user's contacts and accessing collaborative spaces like SharePoint.
   - The next step is the exfiltration of data such as recorded phone calls and SMS inboxes over C2 channels.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The reconnaissance phase involves gathering information from the compromised user's contacts and SharePoint.
   - The exfiltration phase involves sending the gathered data (phone calls and SMS inboxes) over C2 channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying network connections and services. While it could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it doesn't directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a covert channel. This could be relevant for exfiltrating data over C2 channels, but it doesn't directly describe the reconnaissance phase.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system. It is more about the initial compromise and less about the exfiltration phase.
   - **D: T1037.001-Logon Script (Windows)**
     - This technique involves using logon scripts to execute malicious code. It is more about the initial compromise and less about the exfiltration phase.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question describes a sequence where reconnaissance is done, followed by exfiltration. The exfiltration phase involves sending data over C2 channels, which aligns best with the use of application layer protocols to establish a covert channel.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
