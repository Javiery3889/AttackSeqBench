Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - It also states that the implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying network connections and services available on the network. It is not directly related to the implant's persistence mechanism or the communication with control servers.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. Given that the implant downloaded a second-stage binary to the startup folder, it is likely that the implant uses a command or scripting interpreter to execute this binary at startup.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - Similar to T1016.001, this technique involves discovering network configurations. It is not directly related to the implant's persistence or communication with control servers.
   - **D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves poisoning network protocols to redirect traffic. While it can be used for lateral movement or data exfiltration, it is not directly related to the implant's persistence mechanism or the communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The implant ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder suggests that the implant uses a command or scripting interpreter to execute this binary at startup.
   - The communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests is a separate step that occurs after the implant has established persistence.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the use of a command or scripting interpreter to execute the second-stage binary at startup.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
