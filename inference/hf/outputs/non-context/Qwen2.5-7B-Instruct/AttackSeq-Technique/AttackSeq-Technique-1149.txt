Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves GroundPeony using DLL side-loading to evade defenses.
   - The payload is decoded and launched from "mic.doc."
   - The communication with the C&C server at "app.onedrivo.com" is the next step in the sequence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question is asking about the technique that facilitated communication with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. It does not directly relate to establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It is not typically used for establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - **C: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols to transfer files. While it could be used to transfer files to the C&C server, it is not the most direct method for establishing communication.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it could be used in the context of the attack, it does not directly facilitate communication with the C&C server.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The most plausible technique for establishing communication with a C&C server would be a method that directly facilitates the transfer of data or commands between the compromised system and the server. Among the given options, T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols is the most relevant as it directly involves transferring data, which could include commands or data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**
