To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Spearphishing Email**: The company received a spearphishing email containing an Excel attachment. This is the initial vector for the attack.

2. **Excel Attachment**: The user likely opened the Excel attachment, which is a common method for initiating an attack.

3. **Malware Execution**: After opening the attachment, the malware would need to execute to perform its malicious actions. This is where the TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework come into play.

4. **Evasion Mechanism**: The malware then deletes the original file to evade detection and defense mechanisms.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves the user executing a program or script. While this is a plausible step, it does not directly address the deletion of the original file.

- **B: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the attacker accessing data from the local system. This is not directly related to the execution or deletion of files.

- **C: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves the attacker using native APIs to perform actions. This could be relevant if the malware uses system-level functions to delete the file, but it is not the most direct TTP for the deletion action.

- **D: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**: This technique involves adding entries to the Windows Registry to ensure the malware runs at system startup. While this is a common method for persistence, it does not directly address the deletion of the original file.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible TTP that directly addresses the deletion of the original file to evade detection is a native API call. This is because the malware would likely use a system-level function to delete the file, which is best described by T1106-Native API.

**Final Answer: C: T1106-Native API**
