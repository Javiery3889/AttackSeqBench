Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The sequence of TTPs described in the question is:
1. Downloading malware using BITS.
2. Deleting traces of their activity through batch files.
3. Brute-forcing and scanning tools during reconnaissance to enumerate services, fingerprint remote servers, and authenticate on ports.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

#### A: T1606.002-SAML Tokens
- **Description**: This technique involves the use of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens for authentication.
- **Sequence Fit**: This does not fit the sequence as it is more about authentication and does not align with the described malware download and deletion of traces.

#### B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
- **Description**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications.
- **Sequence Fit**: This could fit the reconnaissance phase where brute-forcing and scanning tools are used, but it does not directly align with the malware download and deletion of traces.

#### C: T1036.010-Masquerade Account Name
- **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying account names to hide malicious activity.
- **Sequence Fit**: This could fit the deletion of traces phase, but it is not the most direct fit for the sequence described.

#### D: T1070-Indicator Removal
- **Description**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise (IoCs) to avoid detection.
- **Sequence Fit**: This directly aligns with the deletion of traces of their activity through batch files, which is a key part of the sequence described.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves downloading malware using BITS and then deleting traces of their activity.
- T1070-Indicator Removal (D) directly aligns with the deletion of traces, which is a crucial step in the sequence.
- The other techniques (SAML tokens, exploiting public-facing applications, and masquerading account names) do not fit as well with the described sequence.

### Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
