To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **SideCopy**: This is a technique used to copy files or data from one system to another, often used in the context of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **njRAT Malware**: This is a type of remote access trojan used to gain control over a victim's system.
3. **Special Victim IDs of 'kavach'**: This suggests that the malware is targeting a specific system or user with the identifier 'kavach'.
4. **GoLang-based File Recon Plugins**: These are tools used to gather information about files on the infected device.
5. **Exfiltration of Kavach Authentication Databases**: This indicates that the attacker is extracting sensitive data, specifically authentication databases, from the infected device.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique involves intercepting or bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms. While this could be a part of a broader attack, it does not directly follow the exfiltration of authentication databases.

B. **T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting content into web pages or other documents. This is not directly related to the exfiltration of authentication databases.

C. **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or mouse clicks. Again, this is not directly related to the exfiltration of authentication databases.

D. **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location. Given that the question states the exfiltration of authentication databases, this technique directly aligns with the described action.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The question describes the exfiltration of authentication databases.
2. Among the provided options, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the only one that directly relates to the transfer of data, which is the final step in the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: D**
