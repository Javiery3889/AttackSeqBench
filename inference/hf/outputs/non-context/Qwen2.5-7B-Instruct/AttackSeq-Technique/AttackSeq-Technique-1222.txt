Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR.
   - APT10 exfiltrated the data to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves scheduling the transfer of data at a later time. The question does not mention any scheduling, so this is unlikely.
   - **B: T1584.001-Domains:** This technique involves the use of domains for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. The question does not mention the use of a domain for exfiltration, so this is unlikely.
   - **C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service. The question mentions exfiltrating data to a Dropbox account using cURL, which is a command-line tool for transferring data over HTTP. This aligns well with the described exfiltration method.
   - **D: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage:** This technique involves accessing data stored in cloud storage. While the data is stored in Dropbox, the question is about the exfiltration process, not the initial access to the data in the cloud storage.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service, as it directly aligns with the method of exfiltrating data to a Dropbox account using cURL.

Final Answer: C
