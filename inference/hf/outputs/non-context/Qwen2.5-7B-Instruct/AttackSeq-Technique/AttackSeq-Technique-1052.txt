Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Darkhotel APT used digital certificates to sign their backdoors, which is a technique to bypass defenses.
   - After signing the backdoors, the attackers involved encryption and storage of gathered data in log files.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Signing backdoors with digital certificates.
     2. Encrypting the data.
     3. Storing the data in log files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to load malicious code. It does not align with the sequence of signing backdoors and storing data in log files.
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. It does not align with the sequence of signing backdoors and storing data in log files.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to inject malicious code. While it involves signing backdoors, it does not directly address the encryption and storage of data in log files.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It can include hiding files, registry keys, and other data. Storing data in log files can be a method to hide data and avoid detection, which aligns with this technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is best represented by T1564-Hide Artifacts, as it directly addresses the storage of data in log files to avoid detection.

Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
