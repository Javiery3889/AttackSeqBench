To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The FHAPPI campaign used a VBScript to create an object in the shell and execute a PowerShell command running base64 encoded infection code.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this sequence.

2. **Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059.011-Lua**
     - This technique involves using Lua to execute code. The question describes a VBScript and PowerShell, not Lua. Therefore, this is not a likely continuation.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. The question mentions a VBScript and PowerShell, which are both scripting languages. This technique aligns well with the described sequence.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While the question mentions base64 encoded infection code, which is a form of obfuscation, this technique is more about the encoding itself rather than the execution of the code.
   - **D: T1542.004-ROMMONkit**
     - This technique involves using a ROMMON (Read-Only Memory Monitor) to execute code. The question does not mention any ROMMON or firmware-level activities, making this technique less likely.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence involving VBScript and PowerShell, which are both command and scripting interpreters.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (B) directly aligns with the use of VBScript and PowerShell.
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information (C) is related to the base64 encoding but is not the next step in the execution sequence.
   - T1542.004-ROMMONkit (D) is not relevant to the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B
