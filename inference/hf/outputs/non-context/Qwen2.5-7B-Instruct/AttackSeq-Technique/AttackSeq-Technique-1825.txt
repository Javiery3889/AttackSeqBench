Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the adversary used exploit code leveraging a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) to infect victims with Sakula malware. This is a clear indication of the T1210 technique (Exploit Public Facing Application) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Establishing Connections to C2 Infrastructure**: The question states that the adversary established connections to C2 infrastructure at `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`. This involves the adversary communicating with a command and control (C2) server, which is a common step in the attack lifecycle.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a C2 channel. While this could be relevant, it does not specifically address the establishment of a connection to the C2 infrastructure.
   - **B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique is about hiding the C2 infrastructure from detection, which is not directly related to the establishment of a connection.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a malicious web page or drive-by download. This is not relevant to the question as it already mentions initial access via exploit code.
   - **D: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**: This sub-technique involves the use of publish/subscribe protocols to communicate with a C2 server. This is a specific and relevant technique for establishing a connection to a C2 server, which aligns well with the question.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of an application layer protocol to establish a connection to the C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: D: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
