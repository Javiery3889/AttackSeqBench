To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique used to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before exploiting CVE vulnerabilities through spear-phishing emails, let's analyze each option:

1. **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels to maintain or establish a foothold. It is not directly related to gathering information about victims.

2. **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves scanning IP address ranges to identify potential targets. While it can help in identifying potential victims, it is more about reconnaissance rather than gathering specific information about high-profile entities.

3. **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the target to tailor the attack. It is highly relevant to the scenario as it directly involves gathering information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities, which would be crucial for crafting a convincing spear-phishing email.

4. **T1074-Data Staged**: This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration or use in a future attack. It is not directly related to the initial gathering of information about the target.

Given the context of the question, the most relevant technique is T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information, as it directly pertains to the collection of information about high-profile entities to tailor the spear-phishing attack.

Final Answer: C
