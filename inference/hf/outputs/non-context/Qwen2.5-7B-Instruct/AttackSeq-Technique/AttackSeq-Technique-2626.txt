Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Machete (a hypothetical attacker) has collected and staged encrypted logs and files in a temporary directory.
   - The next step in the sequence is facilitating communication with remote C&C (Command and Control) servers over FTP and HTTP ports.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs involved here are:
     1. Collecting and staging encrypted logs and files.
     2. Facilitating communication with remote C&C servers over FTP and HTTP ports.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and using peripheral devices to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be part of the initial data collection and staging, it does not directly facilitate communication with C&C servers.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying containers to execute malicious code. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols (such as FTP and HTTP) to exfiltrate data or communicate with C&C servers. This aligns perfectly with the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: D
