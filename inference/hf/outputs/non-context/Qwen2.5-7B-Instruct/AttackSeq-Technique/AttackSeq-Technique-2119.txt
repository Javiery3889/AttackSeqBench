To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
- **A41APT** maintained persistence by registering scheduled tasks that ran legitimate executables every 15 minutes to load **DESLoader**.
- **DESLoader** is a type of malware that is often used to deliver other payloads or maintain persistence.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Persistence Mechanism**:
   - The question mentions that A41APT used scheduled tasks to maintain persistence. This aligns with **T1543.003 - Scheduled Task** (though not listed in the choices, it's implied by the use of scheduled tasks).

2. **Execution of DESLoader**:
   - The scheduled tasks run legitimate executables to load **DESLoader**. This implies that the malware is being executed in a way that it appears legitimate, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.

3. **Next TTP**:
   - We need to identify which of the provided TTPs (techniques) is most likely to follow the execution of **DESLoader**.

### Evaluating the Answer Choices:

- **A: T1129-Shared Modules**:
  - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to evade detection. While it could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the execution of **DESLoader**.

- **B: T1106-Native API**:
  - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions. It could be a method used by **DESLoader** to maintain persistence or evade detection, but it doesn't directly follow the execution of **DESLoader**.

- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**:
  - This technique involves using external remote services to communicate with a command and control server. This is a common step after malware execution to establish a communication channel for further instructions or data exfiltration.

- **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**:
  - This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. It is not directly related to the execution of **DESLoader** or the persistence mechanism described.

### Conclusion:
Given the context of maintaining persistence and the execution of **DESLoader**, the most plausible next step would be establishing a communication channel with a command and control server, which aligns with **T1133-External Remote Services**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
