To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The question mentions that TG1021 performed reconnaissance on the target networks. This is a preparatory step to understand the environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Persistence**: TG1021 then used NodeIISWeb malware to maintain persistence by intercepting HTTP requests. This indicates that after reconnaissance, the next step was to establish a foothold and ensure long-term access.

3. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious content into a web page or application. While it can be used for persistence, it is not the most direct step after reconnaissance.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. This could be a step after reconnaissance to find and exploit a specific vulnerability, but it is not directly related to maintaining persistence.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the client machine. While it can be part of the attack chain, it is more focused on the client side and not directly related to maintaining persistence on the server.
   - **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. This aligns well with the use of NodeIISWeb malware to intercept HTTP requests, as it directly supports maintaining a long-term presence on the server.

Given the sequence of events and the focus on maintaining persistence, the most plausible technique that occurred after reconnaissance is T1543-Create or Modify System Process.

**Final Answer: D**
