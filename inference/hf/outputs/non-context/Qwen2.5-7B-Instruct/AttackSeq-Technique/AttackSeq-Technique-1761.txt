To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Deployment**: The question mentions the deployment of multiple variants of a custom VBS backdoor and the execution of VBS scripts for potential data collection. This indicates that the attackers have already gained a foothold and are attempting to gather information.

2. **Communication Establishment**: The next step described is the establishment of communication with Shuckworm's servers to download additional payloads. This implies that the attackers need to set up a channel to receive further instructions or malware.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to establish a command and control (C2) channel. This is a common method for attackers to communicate with their servers while maintaining stealth and avoiding detection by network security measures.

- **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. While this can help evade simple network monitoring, it is not as comprehensive as using application layer protocols, which can be more sophisticated and harder to detect.

- **C: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique is related to using container orchestration platforms to run malicious code. It is not directly related to establishing a C2 channel with a server.

- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to run malicious code at a later time. While this can be part of the attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to establishing communication with a server.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for establishing communication with Shuckworm's servers and downloading additional payloads is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly addresses the need to set up a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
