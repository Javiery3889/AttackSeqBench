To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware first gathered information such as system details, running processes, and open ports.
   - Then, it encrypted the data using an RSA public key.
   - Finally, it uploaded the encrypted data to the C2 server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. While it could be part of gathering information, it is not directly related to the data collection of system details, running processes, and open ports.
   - **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data** - This technique involves archiving the collected data, which is a logical step after gathering information. It prepares the data for further actions, such as encryption and exfiltration.
   - **C: T1612-Build Image on Host** - This technique involves creating a disk image of the host. While it could be part of data collection, it is not directly related to the specific information (system details, running processes, and open ports) mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1598-Phishing for Information** - This technique involves using phishing to gather information. However, the question states that the malware already has the information, so phishing is not the next step.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already gathered the necessary information.
   - The next logical step would be to prepare this data for further actions, such as encryption and exfiltration.
   - Among the given choices, T1560-Archive Collected Data (B) is the most relevant as it directly involves archiving the collected data, which is a preparatory step before encryption and exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B**
