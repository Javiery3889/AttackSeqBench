To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the adversaries used reflective code loading to evade defenses, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs and the provided answer choices.

1. **Reflective Code Loading (T1543.003)**: This technique involves loading a malicious payload into memory without writing it to the disk, which is a common method to evade disk-based detection mechanisms.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple stages of communication to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. While it can be used after reflective code loading, it doesn't directly follow the act of loading the code.
   - **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**: This technique involves using DNS queries to exfiltrate data or for command and control (C2) communications. It could be a step after reflective code loading, but it's more about communication rather than the next step in the attack sequence.
   - **C: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**: This technique involves using conditional access policies to control access to resources. It is more about access control and doesn't directly follow the act of reflective code loading.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access to a system. While it can be part of an attack sequence, it is more about the initial compromise rather than the next step after reflective code loading.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - Reflective code loading is used to evade disk-based detection.
   - After the code is loaded, the next logical step would be to establish a means of communication or data exfiltration.
   - Among the choices, T1568.003-DNS Calculation (B) is the most relevant as it directly involves communication, which is a common next step after loading a payload into memory.

**Final Answer: B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
