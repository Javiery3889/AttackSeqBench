To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attack sequence starts with gaining access via spear-phishing using MS Word documents exploiting CVE vulnerabilities.
   - After gathering information through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, a technique is used to further the attack.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
     - This technique involves leveraging trusted relationships to gain access to a system. It is plausible that after gathering information, the attackers might use this technique to establish a trusted relationship to facilitate further access or actions.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While this could be a step after gathering information, it is more about hiding the payload rather than establishing a trusted relationship.
   - **C: T1593.003-Code Repositories**
     - This technique involves using code repositories to distribute malicious code. It is less likely to be the immediate next step after gathering information through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, as it is more about the distribution phase.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malicious content. Since the question states that the initial access was via spear-phishing, this technique is not the next step but rather the initial step.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is via spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - After gathering information, the attackers need to establish a more persistent or trusted foothold.
   - T1199-Trusted Relationship is the most plausible technique to establish a trusted relationship, which can be used to further the attack or maintain access.

**Final Answer: A: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
