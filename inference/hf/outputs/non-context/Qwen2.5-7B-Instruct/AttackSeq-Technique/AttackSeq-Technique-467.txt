To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Hidden Cobra attached the Bankshot implant to a malicious Word document for targeted spear phishing emails.**
   - This indicates that the initial step was the creation and distribution of a malicious document.

2. **Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Bankshot implant exploited CVE-2018-4878 using an embedded Flash script?**
   - The next step involves the exploitation of a vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878) using an embedded Flash script. This suggests that the attacker needed to ensure the target opened the document and that the Flash script was executed.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1588.005-Exploits**: This technique involves the exploitation of a vulnerability. However, it is more specific to the exploitation phase and does not necessarily precede the initial distribution of the malicious document.

B. **T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**: This technique involves setting up and maintaining infrastructure for the attack. It is not directly related to the initial distribution of the malicious document or the exploitation phase.

C. **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the target organization. This is a crucial step before crafting a targeted spear phishing email, as it helps tailor the attack to the specific victim.

D. **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. While it is a valid TTP, it is more relevant to post-exploitation activities rather than the initial attack phase.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible TTP that would occur before the exploitation of CVE-2018-4878 is the gathering of information about the target organization to craft a convincing spear phishing email.

**Final Answer: C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
