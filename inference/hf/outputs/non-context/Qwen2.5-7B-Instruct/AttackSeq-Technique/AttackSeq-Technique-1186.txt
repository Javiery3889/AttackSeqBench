To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The backdoor function has already gathered machine information during the Discovery phase.
   - The next step is to extract visual data from the victim's system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing the contents of a user's screen, which directly aligns with the need to extract visual data.
   - **B: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access or perform actions. While it could be part of an attack, it does not directly extract visual data.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the attacker. It does not directly relate to extracting visual data.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence** - This technique involves using Confluence, a collaborative document management platform, which is not directly related to extracting visual data from the victim's system.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the next step is to extract visual data.
   - T1113-Screen Capture is the only technique that directly involves capturing visual data from the victim's system.
   - The other techniques do not align as closely with the specific need to extract visual data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture
