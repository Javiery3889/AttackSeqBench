Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where DLL sideloading is performed with `igfxtray.exe` and a payload is initiated.
   - The next step in the sequence is ensuring that T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - DLL sideloading with `igfxtray.exe`: This is a technique to inject malicious code into a legitimate process.
   - Initiating further execution of the payload: This means the payload is executed after the DLL sideloading.
   - Ensuring T9000's components run or load with every user mode process: This implies a persistence mechanism that ensures the malicious components are loaded with every user session.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique is about evading detection by virtualization and sandboxing environments. It does not directly relate to ensuring components run with every user mode process.
   - **B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection. It does not align with the requirement of ensuring components run with every user mode process.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malicious code is executed at boot time or during user logon. This aligns well with the requirement of ensuring T9000's components run with every user mode process.
   - **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it does not specifically ensure that components run with every user mode process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures T9000's components run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
