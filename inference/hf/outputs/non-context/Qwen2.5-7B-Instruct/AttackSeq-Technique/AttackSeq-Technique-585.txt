Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools.
   - Dumping credentials using Mimikatz.
   - Using Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems in the network.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating accounts, which is not directly related to running commands or dumping credentials. It is more about discovering accounts rather than executing commands or using tools.
   - **B: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using administrative shares to gain access to files or execute commands. While it could be used to run commands, it does not directly align with the use of Impacket atexec, which is a specific tool for running commands on remote systems.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternate authentication material, such as Kerberos tickets or NTLM hashes, to gain access to systems. Impacket's atexec tool can be used to run commands on remote systems using these credentials, making this a strong candidate.
   - **D: T1137-Office Application Startup**
     - This technique involves using office applications to execute malicious code. It does not align with the use of Impacket atexec for running commands on remote systems.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where threat actors use a webshell to run commands, dump credentials, and then use Impacket atexec to run commands on other systems.
   - Impacket atexec is a tool that can be used to run commands on remote systems using the credentials obtained through Mimikatz.
   - The technique that best aligns with using a tool like Impacket atexec to run commands on other systems is T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material, as it involves using alternate authentication material to gain access to systems.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
