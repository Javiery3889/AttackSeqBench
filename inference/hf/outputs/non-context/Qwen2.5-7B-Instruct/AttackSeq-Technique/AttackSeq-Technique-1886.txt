To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Staging Data Collected from Network Shared Drives**: This suggests that the attackers have already gained access to the network and have collected data from shared drives. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.

2. **Archiving Data with Specific Utilities**: This indicates that the attackers are preparing the data for further use, possibly for exfiltration or for use in other malicious activities.

3. **Transfer of Tools and Communication within the Network**: This implies that the attackers are moving their tools and establishing a means of communication within the network to maintain persistence and control.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through a third-party server. While this can be used for communication, it doesn't directly address the transfer of tools and the need for persistence within the network.

B. **T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**: This technique involves adding a loadable kernel extension (LKM) to a system to gain persistence. However, it is more focused on maintaining persistence rather than transferring tools and establishing communication.

C. **T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to establish a connection to a remote system. This could be used to transfer tools and establish communication, but it is more about the method of communication rather than the transfer of tools.

D. **T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for command and control (C2) communications. While it is important for maintaining stealth, it doesn't directly address the transfer of tools and the need for communication.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve a method that directly facilitates the transfer of tools and the establishment of communication within the network. **T1021-Remote Services** (C) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the need to transfer tools and establish a means of communication within the network.

**Final Answer: C**
