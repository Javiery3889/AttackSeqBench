To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Exploiting Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for initial access**: This indicates the initial compromise of the network.
2. **Before moving laterally using stolen credentials and EternalBlue vulnerability**: This suggests that the attacker needs to gather information about the network to identify and exploit other systems.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to run malicious code. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the initial discovery and identification of vulnerable systems.
- **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about files and directories on a system. This could be useful for identifying and exploiting other systems, but it is more focused on the content of files and directories rather than the network itself.
- **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves identifying services and their versions on network hosts. This is a critical step in identifying vulnerable systems within the network, which aligns well with the context of the question.
- **D: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim host, such as system configurations and user accounts. While this is useful, it is more focused on the specific host rather than the network as a whole.

Given the context of the question, which mentions identifying vulnerable systems within the network, the most plausible TTP is the one that directly addresses the discovery of network services and their versions.

**Final Answer: C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
