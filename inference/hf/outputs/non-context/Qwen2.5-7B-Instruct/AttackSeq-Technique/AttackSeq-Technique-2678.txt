Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - ZoxPNG uses HTTP GET and POST requests containing PNG files to establish communication with the C2 server.
   - After this, ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is the use of HTTP GET and POST requests with PNG files, which is related to the use of application layer protocols.
   - The next TTP is the registration of command handlers and the establishment of a loop for communication and command dispatch.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1106-Native API** - This technique involves the use of native APIs to perform actions, which is not directly related to the communication and command dispatch loop.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols, which aligns with the initial use of HTTP GET and POST requests. However, it does not directly address the command dispatch loop.
   - **C: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow** - This technique involves the use of the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files, which is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **D: T1106-Native API** - This is the same as choice A, which is not the best fit for the described sequence of TTPs.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The most relevant technique for the command dispatch loop is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly relates to the ongoing communication and command handling process.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
