To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware, we need to analyze the sequence of events described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of Events:**
   - Employees received weaponized phishing emails.
   - Employees enabled macros in the attachments.
   - As a result, BlackEnergy 3 malware was executed on workstations.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1569.001-Launchctl**: This technique involves the use of the `launchd` and `launchctl` utilities to manage and execute processes. It is not directly related to the initial infection vector (phishing email) or the user action (enabling macros).
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to reduce the size of malware and evade detection. It is not directly related to the initial infection vector or the user action.
   - **C: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves the discovery of remote systems, which is not directly related to the initial infection vector or the user action.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves the execution of code by a user, which aligns with the scenario where employees enabled macros in the weaponized phishing email attachments, leading to the execution of the malware.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a scenario where employees were tricked into enabling macros in a phishing email, which then led to the execution of malware.
   - The ATT&CK technique that best fits this scenario is T1204-User Execution, as it directly involves the user executing code (macros in this case) that leads to the execution of malware.

**Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution**
