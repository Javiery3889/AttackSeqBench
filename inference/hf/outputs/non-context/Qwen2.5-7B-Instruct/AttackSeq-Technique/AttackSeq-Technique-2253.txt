Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves:
     - Utilizing GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
     - Performing discovery to lure victims with decoy documents and cloned websites.
     - Harvesting access credentials from central Indian government employees using SideCopy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1056.001-Keylogging:** This technique involves the use of keyloggers to capture keystrokes and thus obtain credentials. While this could be a method to harvest credentials, the question does not specifically mention keylogging tools or keystroke capture.
   - **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores:** This technique involves stealing credentials from password managers or other password storage mechanisms. The question does not mention password managers or other password storage systems, so this is less likely.
   - **T1110.001-Password Guessing:** This technique involves attempting to guess passwords. The question does not mention any password guessing attempts, so this is also less likely.
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization, which aligns with the discovery phase of the attack (luring victims with decoy documents and cloned websites). However, the question specifically mentions harvesting access credentials, which is a different phase of the attack.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is the direct harvesting of credentials from the victims. The technique that best fits this is T1555-Credentials from Password Stores, as it directly addresses the harvesting of credentials.

Final Answer: B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
