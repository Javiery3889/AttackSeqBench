Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that GreyEnergy used its malware framework to develop modular espionage tools for tasks like keylogging and file extraction.
   - This is followed by the use of distinct infection vectors such as spearphishing and compromised web servers for initial access.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1590.005-IP Addresses**
     - This technique involves the use of IP addresses for command and control (C2) communications. While it is a common technique, it is more likely to occur after the initial infection vector has been established.
   - **B: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
     - This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect the malware or data. It is a method to ensure that the malware or data remains functional and undetected, but it is not directly related to the initial infection vector.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding the malware or other artifacts on the system to avoid detection. It is a common technique used after the initial infection to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization to tailor the attack. It is a preparatory step that could occur before the initial infection vector is used, but it is not directly related to the malware development or the infection vectors.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the malware development and before the use of infection vectors. The technique that best fits this description is T1564-Hide Artifacts, as it is a method to maintain the malware's presence on the system after the initial infection.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
