To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain initial access to the victim networks. This aligns with the T1496 technique (Exploit Public-Facing Application) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Securing Persistence**: The question asks about the technique that occurred before securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems. Persistence techniques are categorized under T1569 (Persistence) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim, which is not directly related to securing persistence. It is more about reconnaissance and not about establishing a foothold.

B. **T1136-Create Account**: This technique involves creating a new account on the target system, which can be a step towards persistence. However, it is more about gaining access rather than securing persistence.

C. **T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**: This technique involves using a combination of legitimate and illegitimate identities to blend in with the network. While it can be a method to maintain persistence, it is more about blending in rather than directly securing persistence.

D. **T1590.002-DNS**: This technique involves manipulating DNS records to redirect traffic or hide malicious domains. DNS manipulation can be a method to maintain persistence by ensuring that the malware can communicate with its command and control servers without being detected.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to first gain initial access and then use a technique that directly supports maintaining persistence. DNS manipulation (T1590.002) is a common method to ensure that the malware can communicate with its C2 servers, which is a key aspect of persistence.

**Final Answer: D**
