Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a vulnerability in Microsoft Office is exploited to install malware.
   - After the malware installation, the malware begins beaconing to a CnC server using an HTTP GET request pattern.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - The second TTP is the malware beaconing to a CnC server using an HTTP GET request pattern.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols, which could include HTTP GET requests. However, it does not directly describe the action of beaconing to a CnC server.
   - **B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
     - This technique involves compromising software dependencies and development tools, which is not directly related to the beaconing process.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. While it could be a method to initially deliver the exploit, it does not directly describe the beaconing process.
   - **D: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API**
     - This technique involves using cloud instance metadata APIs to gather information about the cloud environment. It is not directly related to the beaconing process.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the malware began beaconing to a CnC server using an HTTP GET request pattern.
   - The most plausible sequence would be the initial exploitation of the vulnerability in Microsoft Office, followed by the malware beaconing to the CnC server.
   - None of the provided techniques directly describe the initial exploitation of the vulnerability, but the closest in context to the beaconing process is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves the use of HTTP, which is part of the beaconing process.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
