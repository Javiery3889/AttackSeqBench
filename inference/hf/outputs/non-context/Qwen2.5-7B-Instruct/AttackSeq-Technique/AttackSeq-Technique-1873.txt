To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Scote malware began providing backdoor access by collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles, we need to analyze the sequence of actions and identify the initial step that would enable the malware to perform these actions.

1. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves the use of malicious content to entice users to provide sensitive information or to install malware. Phishing could be used to distribute the Scote malware, which would then proceed to collect C2 information.

2. **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves the use of valid credentials to gain access to systems. While this could be a step in the process, it is more likely to occur after the malware has already gained a foothold in the system.

3. **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves the use of a web service to communicate with the attacker. This could be a step in the process, but it is more likely to occur after the malware has established a backdoor and is communicating with the C2 server.

4. **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves the use of multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. This could also be a step in the process, but it is more likely to occur after the malware has already established a backdoor and is communicating with the C2 server.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible initial step that would enable the Scote malware to collect C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles is through a phishing campaign. This would distribute the malware and provide the initial access needed to perform the subsequent actions.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
