To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Encoded Blobs and PowerShell Scripts**: The question mentions that the attack used encoded blobs to evade detection through PowerShell command line scripts for downloading additional malware. This indicates that the initial stage of the attack involved using PowerShell to download malware, which aligns with the T1059.003 - PowerShell technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Downloading Additional Malware**: The next step is the download of additional malware, which is a common technique in multi-stage attacks. This could be related to T1194 - Download or Upload via HTTP, T1133 - Download via Peer to Peer (P2P) Network, or T1027 - Download via FTP, among others.

3. **Dropping Elephant's File-Stealer Module**: The question specifies that the Elephant's file-stealer module is dropped. This module is known for stealing files, which aligns with the T1041 - Data from Local System technique in the context of exfiltration.

4. **Collecting Specific File Types for Exfiltration**: The final step is the collection of specific file types for exfiltration. This is a common tactic in data theft and aligns with T1041 - Data from Local System.

Now, let's evaluate the provided answer choices:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using malicious content to entice users to provide sensitive information. While phishing can be a vector for initial compromise, it does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **B: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory to extract credentials. While this can be a method for credential theft, it does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. While this can be a method for credential theft, it does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **D: T1495-Firmware Corruption**: This technique involves corrupting firmware to gain persistence or maintain access. While this can be a method for maintaining access, it does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible answer is the one that directly aligns with the initial compromise and the subsequent actions. The initial compromise through PowerShell and the subsequent actions of downloading and dropping malware, followed by the collection of specific file types, suggest a more direct path to data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: T1041 - Data from Local System** (not explicitly listed in the choices, but implied by the need to collect and exfiltrate specific file types). However, since the choices do not include T1041, the closest and most plausible choice based on the described sequence is:

**Final Answer: C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** (as it is the closest to the data collection and exfiltration phase, even though it is not a perfect match).
