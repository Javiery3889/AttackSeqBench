To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious macro downloads and executes a second-stage downloader, leading to the deployment of Lokibot.
   - After the deployment, Lokibot uses 'fileless' UAC bypass and fodhelper.exe for privilege escalation.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs:**
   - **T1546.015-Component Object Model (COM) Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking a COM object to execute arbitrary code. It is not directly related to privilege escalation but rather to executing code.
   - **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves exploiting mechanisms like UAC bypass to gain higher privileges. It aligns well with the 'fileless' UAC bypass mentioned in the question.
   - **T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a process to execute it. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it is not directly related to the UAC bypass mentioned.
   - **T1136.002-Domain Account:** This technique involves using a domain account to gain access. It is more about gaining access through credentials rather than directly related to the UAC bypass.

3. **Evaluating the Options:**
   - **A: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:** This is not directly related to the UAC bypass mentioned.
   - **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This directly aligns with the 'fileless' UAC bypass mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1055-Process Injection:** While it can be used for privilege escalation, it is not directly related to the UAC bypass.
   - **D: T1136.002-Domain Account:** This is about gaining access through credentials, not directly related to the UAC bypass.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the 'fileless' UAC bypass and fodhelper.exe for privilege escalation is T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism.

Final Answer: B
