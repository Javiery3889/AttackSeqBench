To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Exploiting Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities**: This is the initial step where the SparrowDoor backdoor is executed.
2. **Injecting Encrypted Shellcode MpSvc.dll into Processes**: This is the next step where the backdoor is hidden and executed within legitimate processes to evade detection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one aligns best with the attack sequence:

- **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique involves the attacker using mechanisms to communicate between processes. While this could be a method used to inject the shellcode, it is not the most direct or common method for hiding malicious code within processes.
  
- **B: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**: This technique involves the attacker modifying the access token of a process to gain elevated privileges. This is more about privilege escalation and does not directly relate to hiding the shellcode within processes.
  
- **C: T1592.002-Software**: This technique involves the attacker using software to hide or modify the behavior of other software. This could be relevant as it pertains to hiding the shellcode, but it is not as specific to the process injection aspect.
  
- **D: T1027.003-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding information within other non-secret data. In the context of injecting shellcode into processes, this could refer to hiding the shellcode within legitimate-looking process data, which aligns well with the need to evade detection.

Given the context of injecting encrypted shellcode into processes for defense evasion, the most plausible technique is one that directly addresses hiding the malicious code within the process. **T1027.003-Steganography** fits this description best.

**Final Answer: D**
