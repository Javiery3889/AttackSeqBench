Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The attack sequence starts with exploiting an Exchange Server via ProxyLogon.
   - A webshell is uploaded for high-privilege code execution.
   - The goal is to achieve persistence by creating a Windows system service named 'HP Digital Image.'

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it could be part of the process, it doesn't directly align with the sequence of creating a system service.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or control the target system. It doesn't fit the context of creating a system service.
   - **C: T1505.002-Transport Agent**
     - This technique involves using a transport agent to maintain access to the target system. It's more about maintaining access rather than creating a system service.
   - **D: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves using a scheduled task to run a command or script. This aligns well with the goal of creating a system service, as creating a system service is a form of scheduled task that runs at system startup.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After gaining high-privilege code execution via a webshell, the next step would likely be to create a scheduled task or a system service to ensure persistence. T1053.002-At is specifically about using a scheduled task, which is a plausible method to create a system service.

**Final Answer: D**
