To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions lateral movement using vulnerabilities (MS08-067 and MS10-061).
   - The next step involves sending data and receiving commands or updates from predefined URLs.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1608.002-Upload Tool**
     - This technique involves uploading a tool to a remote system. While it could be part of the attack, it doesn't directly address the communication aspect with predefined URLs.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves compromising the trust controls of a system or application. It doesn't directly relate to the communication aspect with predefined URLs.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or receive commands. This aligns well with the described action of sending data and receiving commands or updates from predefined URLs.
   - **D: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**
     - This technique involves impersonating a protocol or service to gain unauthorized access. It doesn't directly address the communication aspect with predefined URLs.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence involves lateral movement using known vulnerabilities.
   - The next step is to communicate with predefined URLs to send data and receive commands.
   - Among the given options, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant as it directly addresses the communication aspect with predefined URLs.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
