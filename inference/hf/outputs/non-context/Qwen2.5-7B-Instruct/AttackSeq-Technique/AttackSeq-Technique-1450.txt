Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - FoggyWeb configuring HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic legitimate AD FS URIs.
     - Retrieving sensitive AD FS data.
     - Exfiltrating this data back to the C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key TTPs here are:
     - Configuring HTTP listeners (likely for data exfiltration).
     - Retrieving sensitive data.
     - Exfiltrating the data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
     - This technique involves using network traffic to signal the presence of an attacker or to communicate with a C2 server. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a physical medium, such as a USB drive. It does not fit the scenario of exfiltrating data over a network.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for data exfiltration. While it could be relevant, it does not specifically address the exfiltration process.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns with the scenario of exfiltrating data back to a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of exfiltrating data back to a C2 server, is best described by T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Final Answer: D
