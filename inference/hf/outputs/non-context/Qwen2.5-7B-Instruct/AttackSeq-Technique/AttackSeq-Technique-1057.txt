To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the Darkhotel APT, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The question mentions that the APT used advanced reconnaissance capabilities to identify victims' locations and stay details. This aligns with the initial phase of the attack.

2. **Maintaining a Global and Dynamic Network Infrastructure**: The question specifies that the APT maintained a global and dynamic network infrastructure, which includes compromised commercial resources. This indicates the need for the APT to establish and maintain a network presence across different locations.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1608.001-Upload Malware**: This technique involves uploading malware to a system. While this is a critical step in an attack, it does not directly address the maintenance of a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

B. **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the compromised systems. While this is important for maintaining stealth and confidentiality, it does not directly address the establishment and maintenance of a global network infrastructure.

C. **T1584.002-DNS Server**: This technique involves compromising a DNS server to redirect traffic. While this can be used to maintain control over network traffic, it is more specific to DNS redirection and does not fully encompass the broader network infrastructure maintenance.

D. **T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising infrastructure to maintain long-term access. This aligns well with the need to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure, as it encompasses the broader scope of establishing and maintaining control over various compromised resources.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The question emphasizes the need for a global and dynamic network infrastructure.
2. Compromising infrastructure (T1584) directly addresses the need to maintain long-term access and control over a wide range of compromised resources, which is consistent with the APT's goal of maintaining a global presence.

**Final Answer: D**
