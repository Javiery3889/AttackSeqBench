To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Lateral Movement (T1562.004)**: The question mentions that APT-TOCS relied on lateral movement within the internal network to conduct attacks. This is a critical step where the attacker moves from one system to another within the network.

2. **Communication with Compromised Systems (T1190)**: The question states that the attackers communicated with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs. This is the final step in the sequence.

The question asks for the TTP that occurred after lateral movement and before the HTTP GET requests. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**: This technique involves disabling or modifying the system firewall to facilitate lateral movement. However, it is not a separate step but rather a method used during the lateral movement phase.

B. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain access to the network. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it does not fit the sequence as it is not mentioned as the step after lateral movement and before HTTP GET requests.

C. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. Given that the question specifies HTTP GET requests, this technique aligns well with the use of HTTP for communication.

D. **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels for C2 communications. While it is a valid technique, it is not specifically mentioned in the question and does not fit the sequence as well as T1071.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Lateral movement (T1562.004) is the initial step.
2. The next step should be the use of an application layer protocol for communication.
3. HTTP GET requests are a form of application layer protocol.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
