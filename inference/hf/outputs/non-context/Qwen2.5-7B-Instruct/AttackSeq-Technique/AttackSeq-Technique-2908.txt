To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated APT15's remote access to the network before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to a system. While this could be a method to establish initial access, it doesn't directly facilitate remote access to the network, which is a prerequisite for deploying a backdoor like RoyalDNS.

2. **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a system. This could include using remote desktop protocols, SSH, or other remote access tools. This method is more aligned with the need for remote access before deploying a backdoor.

3. **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to a system. Similar to T1078.003, this is about gaining access to a system but not necessarily facilitating remote access to the network.

4. **T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**: This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access to a system. While this could be a method to gain access, it is more specific to cloud environments and less likely to be the primary method for gaining remote access to a network.

Given the need for remote access to the network before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor, the most plausible technique is one that directly facilitates remote access. **T1133-External Remote Services** is the most appropriate choice as it directly addresses the need for remote access to the network.

**Final Answer: B**
