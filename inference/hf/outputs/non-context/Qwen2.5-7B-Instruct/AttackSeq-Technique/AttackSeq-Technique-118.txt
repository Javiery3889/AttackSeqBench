To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Agrius to ensure command execution and minimize detection after achieving persistence with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **T1021-Remote Services**: This tactic involves using remote services to establish a connection to a remote system. While this could be part of the overall strategy, it doesn't directly address command execution or minimizing detection after persistence.

2. **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This tactic involves removing or misrepresenting indicators of an attack to avoid detection. This could be relevant for minimizing detection but doesn't directly address command execution.

3. **T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process to execute arbitrary code. This is a strong candidate for ensuring command execution, especially after achieving persistence with a backdoor like 'IPsec Helper'.

4. **T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This tactic involves executing commands through an intermediary to avoid detection. This could be used to ensure command execution but might not be as directly relevant to minimizing detection after persistence.

Given the context of ensuring command execution and minimizing detection after achieving persistence with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, the most relevant TTPs are those that directly address command execution and evasion.

- **T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection** is specifically about injecting code into the memory of a process, which aligns well with ensuring command execution.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal** is about minimizing detection, which is also a critical aspect of the question.

However, since the question asks for the sequence of TTPs that ensures command execution and minimizes detection, the most comprehensive and direct answer would be a combination of T1055.011 for command execution and T1070 for minimizing detection. But since we need to choose the most plausible single TTP from the given options, **T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection** is the best fit for ensuring command execution.

Final Answer: C
