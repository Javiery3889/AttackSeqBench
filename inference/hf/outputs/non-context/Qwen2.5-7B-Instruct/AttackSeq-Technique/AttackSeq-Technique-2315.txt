Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Establish C2 Communication**: The adversary used a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike to establish C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation. This aligns with the use of HTTPS for C2, which is a common technique to avoid detection.

2. **Exfiltrate Staged Data**: The adversary then exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services. This indicates that the adversary is using a custom-built malware to transfer data to a cloud storage service.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves maintaining a two-way communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. While this is relevant to C2 communication, it does not directly address the exfiltration of data to a cloud storage service.

B. **T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**: This technique involves obtaining or using additional cloud storage credentials to access cloud storage services. This is relevant to the exfiltration of data to a cloud storage service, as the adversary would need to have or obtain credentials to access the cloud storage.

C. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the exfiltration of data to a cloud storage service.

D. **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with the C2 server. This is relevant to the initial C2 communication but does not directly address the exfiltration of data to a cloud storage service.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most relevant technique is the one that directly addresses the exfiltration of data to a cloud storage service, which is best captured by T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials.

**Final Answer: B**
