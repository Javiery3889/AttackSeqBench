Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes evading CPU core checks, using large null-padded files, and emitting network beacons with hardcoded header values and encrypted data.
   - The question is asking for the most plausible ATT&CK technique that aligns with these TTPs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves ensuring a malicious payload is executed when a system boots or a user logs on. It does not directly relate to network beacons or encrypted data communication.
   - **B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols** - This technique involves using mail protocols to exfiltrate data or deliver malicious content. It does not align with the use of network beacons or hardcoded header values.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. It could potentially align with the use of network beacons and encrypted data, but it is more general and does not specifically mention hardcoded header values.
   - **D: T1037.003-Network Logon Script** - This technique involves using network logon scripts to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to network beacons or encrypted data communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible ATT&CK technique that aligns with the described TTPs is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves using application layer protocols for C2 communications, which could include network beacons and encrypted data.
   
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
