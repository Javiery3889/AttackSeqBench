To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the deployment of Kingslayer into enterprise environments, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Kingslayer used a stolen code signing private key to deploy a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for Defense Evasion. This implies that the initial step was likely to gain access to the environment and then use that access to deploy malicious software.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the supply chain of hardware components. While this could be a method to gain initial access, it is not directly related to deploying software using a stolen code signing key.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This technique is similar to A but more broadly covers the compromise of software supply chains. It could be a plausible method for deploying malicious software, but it is still not directly related to the use of a stolen code signing key.
   - **C: T1021.005-VNC**
     - This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to gain remote access to a system. While this could be a method to gain initial access, it does not directly explain the use of a stolen code signing key for software deployment.
   - **D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves using remote access software to gain and maintain access to a system. This could be a method to gain initial access, but it does not directly explain the use of a stolen code signing key for software deployment.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of a stolen code signing private key to deploy malicious software suggests that the initial access was already gained, and the focus was on deploying the malicious software in a way that would make it appear legitimate.
   - The most plausible method for deploying such software would be through a supply chain compromise, where the malicious software is integrated into legitimate software updates or distributions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the use of a stolen code signing private key for deployment, is through a supply chain compromise.
   - Therefore, the best answer choice is B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise.

Final Answer: B
