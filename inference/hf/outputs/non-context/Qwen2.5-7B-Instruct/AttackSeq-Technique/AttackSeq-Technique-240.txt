Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware has established persistence through a hidden 'autoupdater' module.
   - The Lazarus group is using a legitimate-looking application.
   - They are also using encrypted network traffic to remain undetected.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Persistence: This is achieved through a hidden 'autoupdater' module.
   - Using a legitimate-looking application: This suggests the use of a technique to make the malware appear as a legitimate application.
   - Encrypted network traffic: This is used to avoid detection by making the communication between the malware and the command and control (C2) server difficult to intercept.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1657-Financial Theft** - This technique is related to stealing financial information, which does not align with the described TTPs.
   - **B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing** - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity. While it can be used to make the malware appear legitimate, it does not directly address the use of encrypted network traffic.
   - **C: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software** - This technique is not a TTP and does not align with the described TTPs.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves making files or information difficult to understand or analyze, which can be used to hide the true nature of the malware and its communications. This aligns well with the use of a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.

Final Answer: D
