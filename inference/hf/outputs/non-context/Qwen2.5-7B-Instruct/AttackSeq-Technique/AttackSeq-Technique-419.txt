To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Lazarus Group first exploited known vulnerabilities and used password spraying to gain initial access to cryptocurrency trading platforms.
   - Before these actions, the adversaries targeted users and their systems to gather information for their attacks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging** - This technique involves the use of keyloggers to record keystrokes, which can be used to capture passwords and other sensitive information. This is a plausible method for gathering information about users.
   - **B: T1110-Brute Force** - This technique involves automated attempts to guess passwords. While it can be used to gain access, it is more of an attack vector rather than a method for gathering information.
   - **C: T1596.005-Scan Databases** - This technique involves scanning databases for sensitive information. While it can be used to gather information, it is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase rather than the initial gathering of information.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, such as names, addresses, and other personal details. This is a direct method for gathering information about users.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the adversaries targeted users and their systems to gather information for their attacks. This implies a method that directly collects information about the users.
   - Keylogging (T1056.001) and gathering victim identity information (T1589) are both methods for collecting information about users.
   - Brute force (T1110) is more about gaining access rather than gathering information.
   - Scanning databases (T1596.005) is more relevant to post-exploitation activities rather than the initial gathering of information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of gathering information about users, is T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information.

Final Answer: D
