To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Exporting saved passwords from Chrome browser installations**: This action is related to data exfiltration or credential harvesting, but it does not directly pertain to maintaining persistence.

2. **Utilizing renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries**: This step is indicative of a technique that helps the attacker maintain persistence by hiding malicious activities under the guise of legitimate system processes.

Given the above, we need to identify which ATT&CK technique can be used to maintain persistence after the initial data exfiltration and before the renaming of utilities.

- **A: T1205.002-Socket Filters**: This technique involves modifying network traffic to evade detection. It is not directly related to maintaining persistence through process hiding or renaming.

- **B: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to maintain access to a system. While it can be used for persistence, it does not directly address the renaming of utilities to hide malicious processes.

- **C: T1136-Create Account**: This technique involves creating new user accounts to maintain access. It is not directly related to the renaming of utilities or maintaining persistence through process hiding.

- **D: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL**: This technique involves using the Netsh command to load a helper DLL, which can be used to maintain persistence by hiding or modifying network configurations. This technique aligns well with the need to maintain persistence after data exfiltration and before renaming utilities.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that fits the described attack sequence is the use of a technique to maintain persistence through process hiding or modification, which aligns with T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL.

Final Answer: D
