Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that SkinnyBoy conducted discovery by enumerating files and directories using APIs such as `FindFirstFileW` and extracted system information using functions like `GetComputerNameA`.
   - These actions are indicative of reconnaissance and information gathering, which are part of the initial attack phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP mentioned is `T1083-File and Directory Discovery`, which aligns with the use of `FindFirstFileW` to enumerate files and directories.
   - The second TTP mentioned is extracting system information, which can be considered as part of the same discovery phase but is more specific to system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This is directly related to the enumeration of files and directories, which matches the first part of the sequence.
   - **B: T1059.005-Visual Basic** - This is not a TTP but a technique that could be used to implement certain TTPs. It does not directly align with the described actions.
   - **C: T1135-Network Share Discovery** - This TTP involves discovering network shares, which is a different phase of the attack and not directly related to the file and directory discovery mentioned.
   - **D: T1559-Inter-Process Communication** - This TTP involves communication between processes, which is not directly related to the file and directory discovery or system information extraction mentioned.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns most closely with `T1083-File and Directory Discovery` as it directly corresponds to the actions of enumerating files and directories and extracting system information.

Final Answer: A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
