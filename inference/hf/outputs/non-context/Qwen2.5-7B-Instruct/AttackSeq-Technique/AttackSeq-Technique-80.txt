To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: OnionDog exploited vulnerabilities in Hangul software and spread through USB Worms.
2. **Establishing Communication**: After gaining initial access, OnionDog established communication with its C&C server.
3. **Downloading Additional Malware**: Once communication was established, OnionDog downloaded additional malware.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best before the communication with the C&C server and the downloading of additional malware.

**A: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging**
- This technique involves establishing a connection across network boundaries. While it could be relevant for the communication phase, it is not directly related to the initial steps of gaining access and spreading.

**B: T1133-External Remote Services**
- This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection. It is more relevant to the communication phase rather than the initial access phase.

**C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
- This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries to execute malicious code. It is more relevant to the execution phase, where the malware might be loaded into memory, but it is not directly related to the initial access phase.

**D: T1505.002-Transport Agent**
- This technique involves using a transport agent to move data or control between systems. It is more relevant to the communication phase, but it is not directly related to the initial access phase.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible technique that would occur before establishing communication with the C&C server and downloading additional malware is one that is directly related to the initial access phase. However, none of the provided options directly fit the initial access phase. The closest fit would be a technique that is part of the initial access phase but is not listed, such as exploiting vulnerabilities or using USB worms.

Since the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs and none of the options perfectly fit, we need to choose the one that is most relevant to the initial phase of the attack. Among the given options, T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking (C) is the closest to being part of the initial access phase, as it involves modifying the execution flow, which could be part of the initial exploitation phase.

**Final Answer: C**
