Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described includes:
     - Executing an installer that placed spyware components.
     - Launching `sysCrt32.exe` along with the VPN software.
     - Ensuring `sysBus32.exe` runs every 3 hours.

2. **Identify the Key TTP:**
   - The key TTP here is ensuring that `sysBus32.exe` runs every 3 hours. This implies a mechanism to schedule the execution of the malware.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a specific process at a specified time. This aligns well with the requirement to run `sysBus32.exe` every 3 hours.
   - **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing or using credentials from password stores. It does not directly relate to scheduling a process.
   - **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts. While it can be used to gain persistence, it does not directly address the scheduling of a process.
   - **D: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
     - This technique involves compromising the supply chain to introduce malicious hardware. It is not relevant to scheduling a process.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures `sysBus32.exe` runs every 3 hours is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.

Final Answer: A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
