To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor has gathered extensive system information during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to support the group's objective during the Collection phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. While it can be used to gather information, it is more focused on visual data rather than system information.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture** - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or mouse movements. It is more relevant to data exfiltration or password harvesting rather than system information collection.
   - **C: T1564.002-Hidden Users** - This technique involves creating or modifying user accounts to hide them from the system. While it can be used to maintain persistence, it does not directly support the collection of system information.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery** - This technique involves identifying and listing running processes on a system. It is directly related to gathering system information, which aligns with the Discovery phase and supports the Collection phase by providing detailed information about the system's running processes.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor has already gathered extensive system information during the Discovery phase.
   - The Collection phase would involve further actions to gather and exfiltrate this information.
   - T1057-Process Discovery (Process Discovery) is the most relevant technique for gathering detailed system information, which can be used to understand the system's environment and identify potential vulnerabilities or valuable data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   Final Answer: D
