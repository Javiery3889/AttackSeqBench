Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Derusbi first gathers system information about the victim's host.
   - Then, it mentions that the malware establishes communication with the command and control (C2) server via HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is gathering system information, which is covered by T1082 - System Information Discovery.
   - The second TTP is establishing communication with the C2 server using HTTP POST requests, which is covered by T1071 - Application Layer Protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique is relevant for the first part of the sequence, where the malware gathers system information.
   - **B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication** - This technique is more about the nature of the communication (bidirectional) rather than the specific protocol used.
   - **C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call** - This technique is not directly related to the HTTP POST request communication.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique is specifically about using application layer protocols for communication, which aligns with the HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves gathering system information (T1082) followed by establishing communication via HTTP POST requests (T1071).
   - However, the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described, focusing on the communication part.

Final Answer: D
