To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Credential Access**: The question starts with the use of exported saved passwords from users' Chrome browser installations. This aligns with the T1003 technique, which involves obtaining credentials from a victim's system.

2. **Persistence using Credential Hopping**: The next step is described as persistence using credential hopping. Credential hopping is a technique where an attacker uses stolen credentials to move laterally within a network. This aligns with the T1078 technique, which involves using valid accounts to move laterally within a network.

3. **Creating new O365 Service Principals**: The final step is creating new O365 Service Principals. This is a technique that allows the attacker to gain access to cloud services and resources. This aligns with the T1560 technique, which involves creating or modifying cloud service principals.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the sequence:

- **A: T1136-Create Account**: This technique involves creating new user accounts. While it could be part of the attack sequence, it does not directly follow the credential access and persistence steps described in the question.

- **B: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This is a sub-technique of T1078, which involves using domain accounts to move laterally within a network. This aligns well with the persistence using credential hopping step in the sequence.

- **C: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves archiving data via a library. It does not align with the sequence of credential access, persistence, and creating new O365 Service Principals.

- **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts to move laterally within a network. This aligns with the persistence using credential hopping step in the sequence.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Credential Access (T1003)
- Persistence using Credential Hopping (T1078)
- Creating new O365 Service Principals (T1560)

The answer choice that best fits the persistence step in this sequence is T1078.

Final Answer: D
