Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is:
     - TG1021 used compromised domain credentials to access shared folders.
     - The NodeIISWeb web shell loader was dropped via SMB.
     - The goal was to compromise additional servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique involves using legitimate system or application features to perform actions with elevated privileges. It does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described.
   - **B: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to execute code on a remote system. While it is a remote code execution technique, it does not directly fit the sequence of actions described.
   - **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
     - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols to distribute information. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting a service running on a remote system to gain access or perform actions. Given that the NodeIISWeb web shell loader was dropped via SMB, this technique fits well as it involves exploiting a remote service (IIS) to gain access to additional servers.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.

Final Answer: D
