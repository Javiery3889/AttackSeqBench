To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **AES Key Encryption with RSA**: This step involves encrypting an AES key using RSA, which is a common practice for secure key exchange.
2. **Sending to C2 Server**: The encrypted AES key is then sent to the Command and Control (C2) server for further command exchange.

Next, we need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration of ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory.

- **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts on the network or host to avoid detection. It could be relevant if the ".a" files were hidden in some way, but the question does not specify any hiding mechanism.
- **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names to bypass static DNS blocking. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of files or hiding artifacts.
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using protocols other than HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS to exfiltrate data. If the ".a" files were exfiltrated using a non-standard protocol, this technique would be relevant.
- **T1037.001-Logon Script (Windows)**: This technique involves using logon scripts to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of files or hiding artifacts.

Given the context of exfiltrating ".a" files, the most plausible technique is T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly relates to the method of exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
