To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The Darkhotel APT used trusted hotel Wi-Fi networks to deliver malware posing as legitimate software updates. This indicates that the initial access was achieved through a trusted network and a deceptive software update.

2. **Next TTP**: After gaining initial access, the next step would likely involve establishing a foothold and maintaining persistence. The question does not specify the exact next step, but we need to identify which of the given TTPs aligns best with the next logical step in an attack sequence.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid user accounts to gain access to systems. While this could be a step after initial access, it is not directly related to the deceptive software update mentioned.

B. **T1199-Trusted Relationship**: This technique involves exploiting a trusted relationship between systems or users to gain access. This could be relevant if the malware leveraged a trusted relationship to spread or maintain access, but it is not directly related to the deceptive software update.

C. **T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique involves using web cookies to maintain persistence or access. While web cookies can be used for persistence, they are not directly related to the deceptive software update mentioned.

D. **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain or maintain access. This is highly relevant because after delivering malware through a deceptive software update, the next step would likely be to subvert any trust controls in place to maintain access and avoid detection.

Given the context of the attack sequence, the most plausible next TTP after delivering malware through a deceptive software update would be to subvert any trust controls to maintain access and avoid detection.

**Final Answer: D**
