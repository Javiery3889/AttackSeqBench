Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet to gain initial access and deploy malicious container images.
   - The key TTPs involved are:
     - Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports (exposure to the internet).
     - Deploying malicious container images.
     - Mimicking popular packages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying the system firewall to allow unauthorized access. While it could be a step in the process, it is not directly related to exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that are exposed to the internet. Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports is a form of exploiting a public-facing application, making this a strong candidate.
   - **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves altering the execution flow of a process to run malicious code. This is more about the execution phase rather than the initial access phase.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
     - This technique involves compromising cloud accounts. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the specific TTP of exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the initial access phase, where attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - Among the given options, T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application (B) is the most relevant as it directly addresses the exploitation of a public-facing application (misconfigured Docker API ports).

**Final Answer: B**
