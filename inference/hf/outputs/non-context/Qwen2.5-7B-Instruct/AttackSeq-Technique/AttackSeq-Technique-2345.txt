To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **BRONZE PRESIDENT developed its own remote access tools**: This indicates an initial phase where the adversary created custom tools.
2. **Utilized PRC-linked infrastructure**: This suggests the use of infrastructure linked to the People's Republic of China (PRC), which could be compromised or controlled by the adversary.
3. **Employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution**: These are well-known remote access tools used for various cyber operations.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is a common method to deliver malware or to gain credentials. However, it is not the most direct or likely method to precede the development of custom tools and the use of PRC-linked infrastructure.

B. **T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique involves the use of web cookies for tracking or persistence. It is not directly related to the development of custom tools or the use of PRC-linked infrastructure.

C. **T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising software supply chains to inject malicious code into legitimate software. This could be a plausible method to precede the development of custom tools and the use of PRC-linked infrastructure, as it would allow the adversary to control the software distribution and ensure the custom tools are delivered to targets.

D. **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves obtaining the ability to perform actions within the target environment. While this is a critical step, it is more likely to occur after the adversary has already established a foothold or has control over the infrastructure.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the need to precede the development of custom tools and the use of PRC-linked infrastructure, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain
