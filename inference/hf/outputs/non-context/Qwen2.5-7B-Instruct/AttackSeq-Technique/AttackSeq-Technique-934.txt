To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Malicious Macro Executed PowerShell Script**: This indicates the initial infection vector, likely leading to the execution of a script or a payload.
2. **Released OfficeUpdateService.exe**: This suggests the deployment of a backdoor or malicious service.
3. **Gathering Host Information**: This is the final step, where the backdoor program collects information from the host.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**: This technique involves the attacker using a network provider DLL to modify network traffic. It is not directly related to the execution of a script or the deployment of a backdoor, making it less likely to be the correct answer.

B. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the attacker using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or control the victim's system. While it could be a step in the process, it is more likely to be the final step after gathering information, rather than an intermediate step.

C. **T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker discovering and using cloud infrastructure. It is not directly related to the execution of a script or the deployment of a backdoor, making it less likely to be the correct answer.

D. **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves the attacker evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. This could be a step that occurs after the initial execution of the script and the deployment of the backdoor, as the attacker might need to ensure the backdoor is not detected by security tools.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible intermediate step after the execution of the PowerShell script and the deployment of the backdoor would be evading detection by security tools, which aligns with T1497.

**Final Answer: D**
