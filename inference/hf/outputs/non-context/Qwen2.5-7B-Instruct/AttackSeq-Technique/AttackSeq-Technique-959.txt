To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a malicious spreadsheet with a macro.
2. **Execution of Malicious Macro**: The macro is executed, which is a common initial step in many attack sequences.
3. **Download and Execution of Malicious Files**: After the macro is executed, it downloads and executes additional malicious files, which is a critical step in establishing a foothold and spreading the infection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1569.002-Service Execution**: This technique involves creating or modifying a service to run at system startup. While this could be a step in the infection chain, it is not the immediate next step after the execution of the malicious files.
  
- **B: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves executing code or programs that are run by a user. This could be relevant if the malicious files are designed to be executed by a user, but it is not the most direct next step after the files are downloaded and executed.

- **C: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves checking the system to ensure that the environment is suitable for the attacker's objectives. While this could be a step in the infection chain, it is not the immediate next step after the files are downloaded and executed.

- **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malicious code is executed at system boot or during user logon. This is a critical step that ensures the persistence and long-term control of the system, making it the most plausible next step after the malicious files are downloaded and executed.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible next step after the malicious files are downloaded and executed is to ensure that the malicious code runs at system boot or during user logon to maintain persistence.

Final Answer: D
