Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack started with exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications like Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint. This aligns with the T1210.003 - Exploitation via Remote Services technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Execution of SparrowDoor**: SparrowDoor is a malware that is known to be used for remote code execution and persistence. This suggests that after gaining initial access, the next step would be to execute the malware on the compromised systems.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system's configuration, users, and network. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access and executing malware.
   - **B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**: This technique involves changing the policies of a domain or tenant. This is more likely to occur after establishing a foothold and gaining more control over the network, but it is not the immediate next step after initial access and execution.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a client-side vulnerability to execute code. Given that SparrowDoor is a client-side malware, this technique aligns well with the immediate next step after gaining initial access and executing the malware.
   - **D: T1053.002-At**: This choice is incomplete and does not provide a full ATT&CK technique, making it an invalid option.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access and executing SparrowDoor would be to exploit the client for execution, as this directly follows the execution of the malware and is a common next step in the attack lifecycle.

Final Answer: C
