Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Babar (a hypothetical or real malware) uses remote thread injection to communicate with its C&C servers.
   - Before this communication, the malware is said to have captured data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.

2. **Identify the Key TTP:**
   - The key TTP here is the method used to capture data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which is a form of data exfiltration but not specifically about capturing data from desktop applications using global hooks.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique is about exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not the standard network protocol, which does not align with the method of capturing data from desktop applications.
   - **C: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is a form of data exfiltration but not specifically about capturing data from desktop applications using global hooks.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands, which is not directly related to capturing data from desktop applications using global hooks.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The technique that best fits the description of capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks is not explicitly listed in the provided choices. However, the closest and most plausible technique that could be related to capturing data from applications is keylogging, which can capture keystrokes and other data from applications.

Given the choices, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: T1056.001-Keylogging**
