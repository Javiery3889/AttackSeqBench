To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
- **SideCopy** utilized malicious LNK files as part of their infection chain.
- This was followed by the deployment of various RATs (Remote Access Tools) and plugins, including file enumerators and credential-stealers.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
- **Description**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system or service to deliver malicious content to the target.
- **Relevance**: While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the use of malicious LNK files and precede the deployment of RATs and plugins.

**B: T1036-Masquerading**
- **Description**: This technique involves the attacker making the malicious content appear to be legitimate.
- **Relevance**: This could be relevant if the LNK files were designed to masquerade as legitimate files, but it does not directly follow the use of LNK files and precede the deployment of RATs and plugins.

**C: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
- **Description**: This technique involves the attacker using network traffic to signal to the attacker-controlled infrastructure that a target has been compromised.
- **Relevance**: This could be a step that occurs after the initial infection and before the deployment of RATs and plugins, but it is not directly related to the use of LNK files.

**D: T1566-Phishing**
- **Description**: This technique involves the attacker using social engineering to trick the victim into providing access or information.
- **Relevance**: Phishing is a common method to deliver malicious LNK files. After the LNK files are used to infect the system, the next step could be to deploy RATs and plugins. Phishing is a plausible method to achieve this.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Infection**: SideCopy used malicious LNK files.
2. **Next Step**: The next step would likely be to use social engineering to trick the victim into executing the LNK files, which is a common method for delivering malware.
3. **Subsequent Actions**: After the initial infection, the attacker would deploy various RATs and plugins, including file enumerators and credential-stealers.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is that the use of malicious LNK files is followed by a phishing attack to trick the victim into executing the LNK files, which then leads to the deployment of RATs and plugins.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
