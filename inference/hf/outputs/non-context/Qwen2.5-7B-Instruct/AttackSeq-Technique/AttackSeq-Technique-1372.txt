Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is:
     1. Reconnaissance using social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information.
     2. Leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1059.002-AppleScript (A):** This technique involves using AppleScript to execute commands on macOS. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **T1558.002-Silver Ticket (B):** This technique is related to Kerberos ticketing and is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information (C):** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which is more aligned with the reconnaissance phase but does not directly address the use of social media apps to steal personal contact information.
   - **T1606-Forge Web Credentials (D):** This technique involves forging web credentials, which aligns with the second part of the sequence where HTTPS landing pages are used to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The first part of the sequence involves using social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information, which is a form of reconnaissance.
   - The second part of the sequence involves using HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials, which is a technique for credential harvesting.
   - Among the given options, T1606-Forge Web Credentials (D) is the most relevant to the second part of the sequence, as it directly involves the forgery of web credentials.

**Final Answer: D**
