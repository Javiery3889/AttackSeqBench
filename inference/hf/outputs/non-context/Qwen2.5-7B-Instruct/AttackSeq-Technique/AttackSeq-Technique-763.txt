Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes UNC1151's initial access method, which was spear phishing campaigns.
   - It also mentions that before gaining access, UNC1151 likely gathered information about victim webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1591.004-Identify Roles** - This technique involves identifying roles within an organization, which is not directly related to gathering information about webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing** - This technique is about the act of sending malicious emails, which is part of the initial access but not the information gathering phase.
   - **C: T1586.002-Email Accounts** - This technique involves compromising email accounts, which is more about the exploitation phase rather than the information gathering phase.
   - **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which aligns with the question's description of gathering details about webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is asking about the information gathering phase before the initial access through spear phishing.
   - T1590-Gather Victim Network Information (D) is the most relevant technique as it directly involves collecting information about the victim's network and related entities, which matches the description in the question.

**Final Answer: D**
