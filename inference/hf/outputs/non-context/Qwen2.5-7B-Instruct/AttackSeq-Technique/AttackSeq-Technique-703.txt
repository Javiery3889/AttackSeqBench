Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) for initial access. This is a known method of gaining initial access to a network.

2. **Maintaining Access**: The question states that TA505 attempted to maintain access by hijacking a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup. This indicates that the attackers are looking to establish persistence on the compromised system.

3. **Scheduled Task Hijacking**: The specific technique used here is hijacking a scheduled task. In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, this is directly covered by the technique T1053.003 - Scheduled Task/Job, which involves creating, modifying, or hijacking scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.

4. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This directly aligns with the technique of hijacking a scheduled task, which is what the question describes.
   - **B: T1590.005-IP Addresses**: This technique involves the use of IP addresses for command and control (C2) communications, which is not directly related to the hijacking of a scheduled task.
   - **C: T1559.003-XPC Services**: This technique involves the use of XPC (Cross-Process Communication) services to maintain persistence, which is not the same as hijacking a scheduled task.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interpreters or scripting interpreters to execute commands, which is not directly related to the hijacking of a scheduled task.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is directly related to the hijacking of a scheduled task, which is covered by T1053.003.

**Final Answer: A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
