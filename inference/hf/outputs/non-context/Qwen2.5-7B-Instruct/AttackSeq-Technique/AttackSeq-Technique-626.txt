Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where ShadowPad, a malware, persists through remotely deployed plugins due to hardcoded control interfaces within the controller.
   - The goal is to identify which ATT&CK technique would enhance anti-forensics capabilities for long-term espionage.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The persistence mechanism (hardcoded control interfaces) is a form of maintaining access.
   - The enhancement of anti-forensics capabilities is related to hiding or obfuscating the malware's presence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to reduce the size of the malware and evade detection. While it can be part of a broader strategy, it does not directly address anti-forensics.
   - **B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space** - This technique is about reducing the number of possible keys to make brute-force attacks more feasible. It does not directly relate to anti-forensics.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique involves hiding or obfuscating the malware's presence to evade detection and analysis. This aligns well with the goal of enhancing anti-forensics capabilities.
   - **D: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation** - This technique is about generating multi-factor authentication requests to bypass security controls. It does not relate to anti-forensics.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that enhances anti-forensics capabilities under long-term espionage is T1564-Hide Artifacts.

Final Answer: C
