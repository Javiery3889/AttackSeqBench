Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where credentials from compromised systems are used for lateral movement.
   - The next step involves the establishment of communications with a C&C server using a PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves credential use for lateral movement and then the use of a backdoor Trojan for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Services registry to gain elevated privileges. It does not directly relate to the communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple channels to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. While it could be relevant, it does not specifically address the communication with a C&C server.
   - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to avoid detection. This is a plausible method for a backdoor Trojan like PoisonIvy to establish communications with a C&C server.
   - **D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative methods to authenticate to a system, which is more relevant to the initial credential use for lateral movement rather than the communication with a C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the communication aspect after the lateral movement.
   - PoisonIvy is known to use non-standard ports for communication to evade detection.
   - T1571-Non-Standard Port directly addresses the use of non-standard ports for communication, which aligns with the behavior of PoisonIvy.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
