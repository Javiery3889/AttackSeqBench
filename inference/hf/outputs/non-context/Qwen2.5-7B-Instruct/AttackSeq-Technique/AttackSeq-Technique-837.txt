Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that WinDealer processes and encrypts data before exfiltration.
   - It also specifies that the communication with the C2 server uses UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key TTPs here are:
     - Data encryption (AES) before exfiltration.
     - Communication with the C2 server using non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
     - It aligns with the use of UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to secure the communication channel.
     - While it aligns with the encryption of data (AES), it does not specifically address the use of non-standard ports.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering and exploiting software vulnerabilities.
     - It does not align with the use of non-standard ports or encryption.
   - **D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves using digital certificates for secure communication.
     - It aligns with encryption but does not specifically address the use of non-standard ports.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with both the encryption of data and the use of non-standard ports for communication is T1571-Non-Standard Port.

Final Answer: A
