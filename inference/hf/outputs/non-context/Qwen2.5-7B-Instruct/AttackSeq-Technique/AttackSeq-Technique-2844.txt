Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware sent system information to an IP address '45.124.132.127' using the command line.
   - The communication with the C2 server leverages HTTPS with a POST method.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware is communicating with a C2 server.
   - The communication uses HTTPS, which is an application layer protocol.
   - The communication method is a POST request, which is a specific type of HTTP request.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
     - This technique involves using a dead drop to exfiltrate data. It does not specifically mention HTTPS or POST requests.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols, which includes HTTPS. It aligns with the use of HTTPS in the question.
   - **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves deploying software, which is not directly related to the communication method described.
   - **D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**
     - This technique involves reverting a cloud instance, which is not related to the communication method described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly relates to the use of HTTPS, an application layer protocol.

Final Answer: B
