Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions "abusing Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to avoid detection." This indicates that the attacker is using a legitimate service (Cloud Shell) to establish a covert channel (reverse SSH tunnel) to gain access to external remote services.
   - The focus is on the initial access phase, which involves the initial compromise of a system or network to establish a foothold.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging:** This technique involves creating a process that mimics another process to evade detection. While it can be used post-compromise, it does not directly relate to the initial access phase or the use of reverse SSH tunneling.
   - **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique involves using default credentials to gain access. While it is a common method of initial access, it does not align with the use of Cloud Shell and reverse SSH tunneling.
   - **C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading:** This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which can be used to evade detection. However, it is not directly related to the initial access phase or the use of reverse SSH tunneling.
   - **D: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection to the target network. This aligns well with the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling, as it involves leveraging a legitimate service to gain access to external remote services.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attacker uses Cloud Shell to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to gain access to external remote services. This aligns with the use of external remote services to establish a connection to the target network.
   - Among the given options, T1133-External Remote Services (D) is the most relevant and plausible technique for the described initial access phase.

**Final Answer: D**
