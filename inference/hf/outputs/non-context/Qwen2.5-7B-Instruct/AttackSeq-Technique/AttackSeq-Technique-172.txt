To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before 'Surtr' connects to a command and control server (C2) and downloads a stage two component to a specific directory, let's analyze each option in the context of the described sequence of TTPs.

1. **T1566-Phishing (A)**: This technique involves the use of malicious content to entice a user to perform an action that results in the compromise of the user's system. While phishing can be a method to initially infect a system, it does not directly lead to the connection to a C2 server and the download of a stage two component.

2. **T1610-Deploy Container (B)**: This technique involves the use of containers to deploy malicious code. However, it is more about the method of deployment rather than the initial infection or the connection to a C2 server.

3. **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols (C)**: This technique involves the use of publish/subscribe protocols to communicate between systems. While this could be used for communication post-infection, it is not typically the initial step in the sequence of TTPs leading to the C2 connection and download of a stage two component.

4. **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels (D)**: This technique involves the use of multiple channels to communicate with the C2 server. It is a common method used by adversaries to ensure persistence and to evade detection. However, it is more about the communication method rather than the initial infection.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible initial step would be an initial infection vector that leads to the subsequent actions. Phishing (T1566) is a common method used to initially infect a system, which then could lead to the establishment of a C2 channel and the download of a stage two component.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
