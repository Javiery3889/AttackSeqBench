To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for FIN4's anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure after stealing credentials through spearphishing emails, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim to tailor the attack. While this is a relevant step in the initial reconnaissance phase, it does not directly facilitate anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.

2. **T1590.002-DNS**: DNS (Domain Name System) is a fundamental part of the internet infrastructure used for translating domain names into IP addresses. While DNS can be used for communication, it is not specifically designed for anonymous communication and is a common target for attackers to manipulate (e.g., DNS tunneling). However, it is not the most direct or specialized technique for anonymous communication.

3. **T1090-Proxy**: Proxies can be used to route traffic through an intermediary server, which can help in anonymizing the communication. This technique is specifically designed to hide the true origin of the traffic, making it a strong candidate for facilitating anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.

4. **T1205.001-Port Knocking**: Port knocking involves a sequence of packets sent to specific ports to gain access to a service. While this can be used to establish a connection, it is not typically used for ongoing, anonymous communication with a C2 server.

Given the context of the question, which focuses on anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure, the most appropriate technique is T1090-Proxy, as it directly addresses the need for hiding the true origin of the traffic.

**Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy**
