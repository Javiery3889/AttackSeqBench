To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the answer choices.

1. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - **FamousSparrow** utilized `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the **SparrowDoor backdoor**.
   - This indicates that the initial step was to execute a command to download and install a backdoor, which is part of the **Execution** phase.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via email to trick the user into executing it. However, the scenario already mentions the use of `cmd.exe` to run commands, which suggests a more direct method of execution rather than a phishing attachment.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications to gain access. While this could be a method to download the backdoor, it is not directly related to the execution of commands via `cmd.exe`.
   - **C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**: This technique involves stealing or misusing access tokens to gain elevated privileges. After downloading and installing the backdoor, the next step might be to manipulate access tokens to maintain persistence or elevate privileges, which is a common follow-up action.
   - **D: T1597-Search Closed Sources**: This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources. This is not directly related to the execution of the backdoor or the subsequent actions that would follow.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The initial step was to use `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the backdoor.
   - After the backdoor is installed, the next logical step would be to ensure that the attacker can maintain access and possibly elevate privileges.
   - Access token manipulation (T1134) is a common technique to achieve this, as it allows the attacker to maintain persistence and potentially gain higher privileges.

**Final Answer: C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
