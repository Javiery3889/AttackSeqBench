Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT took steps to minimize detection by deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes post-execution to avoid detection.
   - This indicates that the adversary is trying to cover their tracks and avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs described are:
     - Deleting volume shadow copies (VSS) to remove forensic evidence.
     - Terminating processes to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing**
     - This technique involves modifying process arguments to evade detection. It does not directly address the deletion of VSS or process termination.
   - **B: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**
     - This technique involves bypassing Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies. It does not directly address the deletion of VSS or process termination.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves using phishing to obtain information. It does not directly address the deletion of VSS or process termination.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which can include deleting VSS and terminating processes to avoid detection. This aligns closely with the TTPs described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1070-Indicator Removal.

Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
