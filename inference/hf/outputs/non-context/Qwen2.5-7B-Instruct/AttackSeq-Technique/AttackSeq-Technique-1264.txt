To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Leveraging AMSI Bypass Method Using a DLL in PowerShell**: This indicates the attacker is trying to evade detection by the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) in PowerShell, which is a common technique to avoid detection by security software.

2. **Establishing Command and Control Through njRAT**: This suggests the attacker is using a remote access tool (RAT) to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

Given these points, we need to identify which of the provided TTPs (Techniques and Tactics) fits best as a Defense Evasion tactic that occurs after the AMSI bypass and before establishing C2.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

- **A: T1565-Data Manipulation**: This technique involves modifying data to evade detection. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly align with the AMSI bypass or the immediate need to hide artifacts or maintain persistence.

- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding files, processes, and network connections to evade detection. Given that the attacker has already bypassed AMSI, the next step would likely be to hide the malicious artifacts (like the DLL used in the AMSI bypass) to avoid detection.

- **C: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**: This technique involves renaming system utilities to evade detection. While it could be a part of the overall evasion strategy, it is more specific and less likely to be the immediate next step after bypassing AMSI.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as the question already mentions the use of a DLL in PowerShell and the establishment of C2 through njRAT.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is to hide the artifacts (files, processes, etc.) that were used in the AMSI bypass to evade detection. This aligns with the "Hide Artifacts" technique (T1564).

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
