To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice.

1. **Exploiting CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions**: This indicates that the attackers used a specific vulnerability to gain initial access and maintain persistence.

2. **Using Google Drive for operations**: This suggests that the attackers are leveraging cloud storage to host and distribute their malicious content or to exfiltrate data.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1491.001-Internal Defacement**: This technique involves modifying or defacing internal web content. While it could be part of an attack, it does not directly relate to using Google Drive for operations.

B. **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be used in conjunction with other techniques, it does not directly relate to using Google Drive for operations.

C. **T1176-Browser Extensions**: This technique involves deploying browser extensions to gain access to user data or to perform actions on the user's behalf. While it could be used to maintain persistence, it does not directly relate to using Google Drive for operations.

D. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or to maintain persistence. While it could be used in conjunction with other techniques, it does not directly relate to using Google Drive for operations.

Given the context of using Google Drive for operations, the most relevant technique would be one that directly involves the use of cloud storage. However, none of the provided options explicitly mention cloud storage. The closest option that could be indirectly related to using Google Drive is T1071, as it involves application layer protocols, which could be used to interact with cloud storage services.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
