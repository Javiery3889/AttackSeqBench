Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - APT35 evaded detection by lying low and avoiding security alerts.
   - Darktrace detected C2 activity with domains like cortanaservice[.]com.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves evading detection, then being detected through C2 activity.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This technique involves changing the resolution of a domain name to a legitimate one to avoid detection. While it could be part of the evasion strategy, it doesn't directly address the C2 activity detected by Darktrace.
   - **B: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique involves using DNS to exfiltrate data or establish C2 communication. Given that Darktrace detected C2 activity with specific domains, this technique aligns well with the detection of C2 activity.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
     - This technique involves degrading, disrupting, or destroying the victim's defensive capabilities. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it doesn't directly address the C2 activity detected.
   - **D: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions to gain unauthorized access. It doesn't directly relate to the C2 activity detected by Darktrace.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the detection of C2 activity, which is a clear indication of the APT35's attempt to communicate with a command and control server.
   - Among the given options, T1071.004-DNS is the most relevant because it directly involves the use of DNS for C2 communication, which aligns with the detection of C2 activity with specific domains.

**Final Answer: B: T1071.004-DNS**
