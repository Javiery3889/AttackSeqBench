Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious Excel document is used to deliver a payload.
   - The payload is then decoded and executed using a PowerShell script.
   - The decoded content is written to the %TEMP% directory.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves adding malware to startup items or other autostart locations to ensure persistence.
     - It does not directly relate to the execution of a PowerShell script or writing content to the %TEMP% directory.
   - **B: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
     - This technique involves the use of DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) to execute code.
     - It is more about the method of execution rather than the writing of content to the %TEMP% directory.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code.
     - This aligns well with the use of a PowerShell script to execute the decoded content.
   - **D: T1055.009-Proc Memory**
     - This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process.
     - It is more about injecting code into an existing process rather than executing a script and writing content to the %TEMP% directory.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a PowerShell script is used to decode and execute the malicious content.
   - The most relevant technique here is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, as it directly involves the use of a scripting interpreter (PowerShell) to execute the decoded content.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
