Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions "anti-analysis techniques such as a custom packer and a virtual machine to execute code." This indicates that the malware is trying to evade detection and analysis.
   - The next step is "downloading second stage shellcode from a specified URL for further control." This suggests that the malware is in the process of establishing a foothold on the target system.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves using a protocol to hide malicious traffic. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly relate to the process of downloading shellcode from a URL.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding files, registry entries, and other artifacts to avoid detection. It is more about hiding the malware's presence rather than the process of downloading new code.
   - **C: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate files or processes. It is not directly related to the process of downloading new code from a URL.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools or malware to a target system. It directly aligns with the process of downloading second stage shellcode from a specified URL.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of downloading second stage shellcode from a URL, is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

Final Answer: D
