Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Secure Communication with C&C Server:**
   - The question mentions that the Duke group communicates securely with their C&C server over encoded and encrypted HTTP/HTTPS channels. This aligns with the use of secure protocols for command and control, which is a common technique in many cyber-attacks.

2. **Archiving and Transmitting Sensitive Information:**
   - The group then archives and transmits sensitive information. This suggests that the data is being prepared for exfiltration or further processing.

3. **Utilizing Legitimate Cloud Services:**
   - The information is being transmitted using legitimate cloud services, which implies that the attackers are leveraging the infrastructure of trusted cloud providers to mask their activities.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:**
   - This technique involves using non-standard protocols for data exfiltration. While it is a valid technique, the question specifies the use of legitimate cloud services, which suggests a more standard approach rather than an alternative protocol.

B. **T1602-Data from Configuration Repository:**
   - This technique involves accessing and exfiltrating data from a configuration repository. The question does not mention a configuration repository, so this does not align well with the described scenario.

C. **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:**
   - This technique involves using web services for data exfiltration. Given that the question mentions the use of legitimate cloud services and HTTP/HTTPS channels, this technique aligns well with the described scenario.

D. **T1585.003-Cloud Accounts:**
   - This technique involves the use of cloud accounts for data exfiltration. While this is a plausible method, the question specifically mentions the use of cloud services for archiving and transmitting data, which is more closely aligned with the exfiltration over web services technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
