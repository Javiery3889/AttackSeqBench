To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Software Bundlers**: This technique is not directly listed in the ATT&CK framework, but it is implied to be a method of delivering the installer.
2. **Obfuscated Batch Scripts**: This technique is listed in the ATT&CK framework as T1027.001 - Obfuscated Files or Information.
3. **Process Hollowing**: This technique is listed in the ATT&CK framework as T1055 - Process Injection, which includes the subtechnique T1055.003 - Process Hollowing.

Given the sequence of TTPs:
- The software bundlers are used to deliver the installer.
- Obfuscated batch scripts are used to evade defenses.
- Process hollowing is used to execute malicious code within legitimate system processes.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique is about hiding the presence of malicious artifacts, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.

B. **T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking COM objects, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.

C. **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described.

D. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters, which aligns with the use of obfuscated batch scripts to execute commands.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible technique that occurred before process hollowing is the use of a command and scripting interpreter to execute the obfuscated batch scripts.

Final Answer: D
