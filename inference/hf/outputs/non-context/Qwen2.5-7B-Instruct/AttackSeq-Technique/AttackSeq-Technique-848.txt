Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where critical systems have been discovered, and valid credentials have been obtained to enable legitimate access within the target network.
   - The adversaries then move across the network to further their objectives.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The adversaries have already gained access and are now moving laterally within the network to achieve their goals.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple channels to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to moving laterally within the network.
   - **B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**
     - This technique involves changing the security policies of a domain or tenant to gain additional access or privileges. While it can be part of a broader attack, it does not directly describe the movement across the network.
   - **C: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. It does not directly describe the movement across the network.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to systems or data. It can be used to move laterally within the network by exploiting services on other systems to gain access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversaries have already gained access and are moving across the network. This suggests they are looking for ways to access other systems or services within the network.
   - T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services directly aligns with the need to move laterally by exploiting remote services to gain access to other systems.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: D
