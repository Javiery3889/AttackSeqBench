To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **HTML Smuggling**: This technique is used to bypass security controls by injecting malicious content into web pages. It is a method to deliver malicious payloads through legitimate-looking web pages.

2. **ENVYSCOUT Delivery Scripts**: ENVYSCOUT is a type of malware used by the APT28 (also known as Sofacy or Sednit) group. It is often delivered through various methods, including HTML Smuggling.

3. **Ensuring Malicious Payloads Were Not Tagged with MOTW**: MOTW (Malicious Object in Trusted Web) refers to the use of trusted objects (like digital certificates) to disguise malicious content. The goal here is to avoid detection by security systems that rely on trusted indicators.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1596.003-Digital Certificates**: This technique involves using digital certificates to sign or embed malicious content. While it can be used to avoid detection, it does not directly address the bypassing of security controls through HTML Smuggling.

B. **T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**: This technique involves compromising a system or network to gain access or control. It does not directly relate to the use of trusted objects to avoid detection.

C. **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access or privilege escalation. It can be used to bypass security measures, but it does not directly address the use of trusted objects to avoid detection.

D. **T1564.009-Resource Forking**: This technique involves splitting a file into multiple parts, with one part being a normal file and the other part containing malicious code. This can be used to hide malicious payloads within trusted files, making it difficult for security systems to detect them.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using trusted objects to avoid detection, which aligns best with **T1564.009-Resource Forking**.

**Final Answer: D**
