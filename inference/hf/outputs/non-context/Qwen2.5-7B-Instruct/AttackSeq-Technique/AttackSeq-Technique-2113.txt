To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
1. **Backdoor Installation**: The attackers have installed a backdoor on the victim's system.
2. **Communication with C&C Server**: The backdoor is used to communicate with a Command and Control (C&C) server.
3. **Messages Exchanged**: The backdoor sends a 'Start conversation' message and receives a 'Get Victim Information' message in return.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:

**A: T1567.001-Exfiltration to Code Repository**
- This technique involves exfiltrating data to a code repository. The scenario does not mention any data exfiltration to a code repository, so this is unlikely.

**B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
- This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. The scenario describes communication with a C&C server and the exchange of messages, which aligns with this technique.

**C: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery**
- This technique involves discovering permission groups on a network. The scenario does not mention any discovery of permission groups, so this is unlikely.

**D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
- This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. The scenario does not mention any evasion of virtualization or sandbox environments, so this is unlikely.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The attackers have a backdoor installed and are communicating with a C&C server.
2. The communication involves sending and receiving messages, which suggests data exchange.
3. Among the given choices, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the only one that directly involves data exfiltration over a C2 channel, which aligns with the described scenario.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
