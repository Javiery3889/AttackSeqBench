Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs involves:
     1. WinDealer malware loading a DLL module into memory.
     2. Stolen information being encrypted.
     3. The encrypted information being staged in the %TEMP% directory with a ".a" file extension.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1546.002-Screensaver** - This technique involves using a screensaver to hide malicious activity. It does not directly relate to the loading of a DLL or the encryption and staging of stolen information.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts on the system. It could be relevant to hiding the encrypted and staged information, but it does not directly address the loading of a DLL or the encryption process.
   - **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT** - These are scripting languages that can be used to automate tasks. They are not directly related to the loading of a DLL or the encryption and staging of stolen information.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to reduce the size of the malware payload and evade detection. While it is related to the loading of a DLL, it does not directly address the encryption and staging of stolen information.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving malware (WinDealer), DLL loading, encryption, and file staging.
   - The most relevant technique would be one that directly addresses the encryption and file staging, which are the last two steps in the sequence.
   - T1564-Hide Artifacts (B) is the closest to the described sequence as it involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts, which could include the encrypted and staged information.

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
