To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware used defense evasion techniques such as HTML smuggling and DLL search order hijacking.
   - After these techniques, the malware gathered system information, including the username and a list of running processes.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system. It aligns well with the described action of gathering a list of running processes.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it is a defense evasion technique, it does not directly relate to gathering system information.
   - **C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating network shares. It does not align with the described action of gathering system information.
   - **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves establishing or maintaining access to a network or system. It is more about the initial compromise rather than the specific action of gathering system information.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware first uses defense evasion techniques (HTML smuggling and DLL search order hijacking).
   - After these techniques, the malware needs to gather specific system information (username and list of running processes).
   - Among the given choices, T1057-Process Discovery is the most relevant to the described action of gathering system information.

**Final Answer: A: T1057-Process Discovery**
