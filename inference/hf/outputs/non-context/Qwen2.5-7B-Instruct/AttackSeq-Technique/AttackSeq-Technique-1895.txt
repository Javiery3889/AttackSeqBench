To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the context and each answer choice in detail.

### Context Analysis
- **FIN13** is a known threat actor that has been associated with various cyber-attacks, including the use of utilities and libraries to archive data for fraudulent transactions.
- The collection phase involves gathering data that can be used for malicious purposes, such as financial fraud.

### Answer Choices Analysis

**A: T1074-Data Staged**
- **Description**: This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration or other malicious actions.
- **Relevance**: After archiving data, the next step would likely be to stage the data for exfiltration or further use. This aligns well with the collection phase and the subsequent actions that might follow archiving.

**B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**
- **Description**: This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection.
- **Relevance**: While renaming utilities can be a part of the attack lifecycle, it is more likely to occur during the initial compromise or during the persistence phase rather than immediately after archiving data.

**C: T1505-Server Software Component**
- **Description**: This technique involves using a server software component to establish a foothold or maintain access.
- **Relevance**: This technique is more relevant to the persistence phase rather than the immediate actions following data archiving.

**D: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**
- **Description**: This technique involves collecting email addresses from local systems.
- **Relevance**: Collecting email addresses is more relevant to the reconnaissance or initial compromise phase rather than the immediate actions following data archiving.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Archiving Data**: The question states that FIN13 used utilities and libraries to archive data.
2. **Next Step**: After archiving, the next logical step would be to prepare the data for further malicious actions, such as exfiltration or use in fraudulent transactions.
3. **Evaluating Choices**:
   - **T1074-Data Staged** directly aligns with preparing data for exfiltration or other malicious actions.
   - **T1036.003-Rename System Utilities** and **T1505-Server Software Component** are more relevant to the persistence phase.
   - **T1114.001-Local Email Collection** is more relevant to the initial compromise phase.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that follows the archiving of data for fraudulent transactions is the preparation of the data for further malicious actions.

Final Answer: A: T1074-Data Staged
