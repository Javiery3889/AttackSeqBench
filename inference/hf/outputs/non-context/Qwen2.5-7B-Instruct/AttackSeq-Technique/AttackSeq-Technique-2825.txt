Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions a phishing email delivering a CAB archive.
   - This is followed by the use of BlackSoul malware, which evades defenses using dynamic string construction and cipher-based deobfuscation.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves copying data to a removable medium, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described (phishing -> CAB archive -> BlackSoul malware).
   - **B: T1591.004-Identify Roles:** This technique involves identifying roles within the target organization, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious content. The question mentions a phishing email, which aligns with this technique.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events described in the question starts with a phishing email, which is a T1566-Phishing technique.
   - After the phishing email, a CAB archive is delivered, which is a step in the attack sequence.
   - The next step is the use of BlackSoul malware, which evades defenses using specific techniques (dynamic string construction and cipher-based deobfuscation).

Given the sequence of events and the alignment with the ATT&CK framework, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
