To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Mustang Panda initially deploys the PlugX implant and then fetches additional shellcode from a C2 IP address.
   - The focus is on the initial deployment of the PlugX implant.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using a protocol that is not typically used for the intended purpose. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly pertain to the deployment of the PlugX implant.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run a malicious payload. It is a plausible method for deploying the PlugX implant, but it does not directly address the initial deployment.
   - **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools laterally within a network. It is not directly related to the initial deployment of the PlugX implant.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools from an external source to the target network. It is more relevant to the initial deployment of the PlugX implant, as it suggests the initial transfer of the tool from an external source to the target system.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the initial deployment of the PlugX implant.
   - T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (D) directly addresses the initial transfer of the tool from an external source, which aligns with the initial deployment of the PlugX implant.
   - The other techniques (A, B, and C) are more relevant to different stages of the attack lifecycle, such as lateral movement or scheduling tasks, rather than the initial deployment.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
