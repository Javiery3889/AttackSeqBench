Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware Tickusb executes as a DLL file.
   - It activates upon the opening of specific programs rather than at startup.
   - The goal is to avoid detection by altering normal programs to load malicious DLLs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a program to execute malicious code. It fits the scenario where the malware is designed to activate upon the opening of specific programs.
   - **B: T1556.004-Network Device Authentication:** This technique is related to network device authentication and does not align with the described behavior of the malware.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. While it is related to loading malicious code, it does not specifically address the hijacking of execution flow upon program opening.
   - **D: T1590.005-IP Addresses:** This technique involves the use of IP addresses for malicious purposes, which is not relevant to the described behavior of the malware.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware Tickusb is designed to execute as a DLL and activate upon the opening of specific programs.
   - This behavior aligns with the concept of hijacking the execution flow of a program to load and execute malicious code.
   - T1574-Hijack Execution Flow is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the modification of the execution flow to load and execute malicious code upon the opening of specific programs.

**Final Answer: A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
