To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Explosive Trojan Leveraged Keylogging Capabilities**: This indicates that the attackers used a Trojan to capture keystrokes, which is a common method to steal credentials.

2. **Gained Access to Administrator Passwords**: After capturing the keystrokes, the attackers obtained administrator-level credentials.

3. **Employed a Command and Control Framework Involving Multi-Tiered Servers**: This suggests that the attackers established a communication channel with the compromised system to control it remotely, likely using a C2 server.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. It does not directly follow the keylogging and credential theft described in the question, nor does it align with the C2 framework.

B. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a C2 channel. While it could be part of the C2 framework, it does not directly follow the keylogging and credential theft.

C. **T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing**: This technique involves spoofing the parent process ID to evade detection. It is a method to hide the malicious process, but it does not directly follow the keylogging and credential theft or the C2 framework.

D. **T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to establish a C2 channel. It directly follows the credential theft and could be the method used to establish the multi-tiered C2 framework.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible TTP that follows the keylogging and credential theft and precedes the C2 framework is the use of remote services to establish the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: D**
