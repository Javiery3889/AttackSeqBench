Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks with malicious RTF and Excel files. This aligns with the ATT&CK technique T1190 (Spearphishing Attachment) and T1192 (Watering Hole).

2. **Execution of Malicious Code**: The question states that ProjectM executed their malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy along with Remote Access Tools (RATs). This execution of code is a critical step in the attack lifecycle and is best described by the ATT&CK technique T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).

3. **Reviewing the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.009-Cloud API**: This technique involves using cloud APIs to perform malicious activities. It does not directly relate to the execution of malicious code through Trojans and RATs.
   - **B: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**: This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which is not directly related to the execution of malicious code.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique directly involves the execution of code or commands on a host, which aligns with the use of Trojans and RATs.
   - **D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: This technique involves using messaging applications to exfiltrate data or deliver commands. It does not directly relate to the execution of malicious code.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is best described by T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).

**Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
