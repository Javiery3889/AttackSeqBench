Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - CosmicDuke is collecting sensitive information using tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitates the transfer of this information to remote servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - CosmicDuke is using tools to collect sensitive information, which is a form of data collection.
   - The next step is to transfer this collected information to remote servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves transferring data to or from a removable medium, such as a USB drive. This does not align with the scenario of transferring data to remote servers.
   - **B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information:** This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which is not related to the transfer of collected data to remote servers.
   - **C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location, which aligns with the scenario of transferring collected data to remote servers.
   - **D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which also aligns with the scenario of transferring collected data to remote servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - CosmicDuke is collecting sensitive information using various tools.
   - The next step is to transfer this information to remote servers.
   - T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service both involve transferring data to external locations.
   - T1020 is more general and can be used for various types of automated data transfer, while T1567 specifically mentions using web services, which is a common method for exfiltrating data.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Both T1020 and T1567 are plausible, but T1567 is more specific to the method of exfiltration over a web service, which is a common and direct method for transferring data to remote servers.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service.

Final Answer: D
