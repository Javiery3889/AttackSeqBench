To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
The question mentions that ActionSpy used modules to gather data such as device location, contacts, call logs, and chat logs from messaging applications. This indicates that the initial TTP involves data collection from various sources on the victim's device.

### Answer Choices:
A. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. While it could be relevant for data exfiltration, it does not directly address the collection of data from the device.

B. **T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique involves stealing a user's password hash to gain access to systems or services. It is not directly related to the data collection mentioned in the question.

C. **T1119-Automated Collection**: This technique involves the use of automated tools or scripts to collect data from a system. It aligns well with the scenario where ActionSpy used modules to gather data from the device.

D. **T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**: This technique involves the collection of email data from a remote email service. While it could be part of a broader data collection strategy, it is more specific to email data and does not directly address the variety of data types mentioned (device location, contacts, call logs, and chat logs).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Initial TTP**: The initial TTP is the collection of various data types from the device.
2. **Evaluate Each Option**:
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: Not directly related to the initial data collection.
   - **T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: Not directly related to the initial data collection.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection**: Directly related to the automated collection of data from the device.
   - **T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**: More specific and not directly related to the variety of data types mentioned.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described in the question, is **T1119-Automated Collection**.

Final Answer: C
