Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Turla malware has already used encryption and rootkit capabilities to evade detection and hide its tracks.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is gathering specific information from systems to enhance their spying operation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware has already used T1059.002 (Encryption) and T1564.001 (Rootkit) to evade detection and hide its tracks.
   - The next step is to gather specific information, which is a form of data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1561.001-Disk Content Wipe** - This technique involves wiping disk content, which is not directly related to gathering specific information for espionage.
   - **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive** - This technique involves accessing data from network shared drives. While it could be part of data collection, it is not the most specific or likely technique for espionage.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories** - This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, which is a more targeted and specific method for gathering information for espionage.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit** - This technique involves using a rootkit to hide malware, which has already been mentioned in the question and is not the next step in data collection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already hidden itself and its tracks.
   - The next logical step is to gather specific information to enhance the spying operation.
   - Among the given options, T1213-Data from Information Repositories (C) is the most specific and relevant for gathering targeted information for espionage.

**Final Answer: C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
