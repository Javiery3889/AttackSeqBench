To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Context**: The question mentions that FIN13 (a known APT group) used tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement. These tools are used to move laterally within a network, gaining access to different systems.

2. **Understand the Sequence**: After lateral movement, the group is described as staging data from network shared drives locally or remotely. This implies that the group has already gained access to multiple systems and is now collecting and preparing data for exfiltration or further analysis.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email content from local systems. While it could be part of a broader data collection strategy, it does not directly align with the described sequence of moving laterally and then staging data from network shared drives.
   - **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data, which aligns well with the described sequence. After gaining access to multiple systems and collecting data from network shared drives, the next logical step would be to archive this data for further analysis or exfiltration.
   - **C: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves compromising email accounts. While this could be part of the initial compromise or lateral movement, it does not directly align with the described sequence of staging data from network shared drives.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While this could be a step in the process, it typically occurs after data has been collected and is not the immediate next step after lateral movement and data collection.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the described sequence and the provided answer choices, the most plausible next step after lateral movement and collecting data from network shared drives would be to archive the collected data.

Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data
