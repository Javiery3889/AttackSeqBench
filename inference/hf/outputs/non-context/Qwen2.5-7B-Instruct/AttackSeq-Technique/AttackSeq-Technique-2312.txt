Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The adversary used discovery commands such as PsLogList to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log.
   - This is followed by exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Discovery of information (using PsLogList).
   - Data collection (extracting the contents of the Windows Security Event Log).
   - Data exfiltration (using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
     - This technique involves using a web portal to capture data. It does not directly align with the sequence of using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.
   - **B: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves accessing data from the local system. It aligns with the data collection step but does not specify the method of exfiltration.
   - **C: T1218.014-MMC**
     - This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to manage and manipulate system objects. It does not align with the data exfiltration step.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It aligns with the final step of exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is best represented by the exfiltration step, which is directly aligned with T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Final Answer: D
