To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **APT15 evaded policy settings disabling the command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe.**
   - This indicates a technique that involves modifying system files to bypass security measures.

2. **Facilitating the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.**
   - This suggests a technique that ensures the backdoor remains installed and operational over time.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
   - This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table to intercept and manipulate system calls. While it is a powerful technique, it does not directly relate to the evasion of policy settings or the installation of a backdoor.

B. **T1562-Impair Defenses**
   - This technique involves degrading, disrupting, or removing security controls. It aligns well with the evasion of policy settings and the installation of a backdoor, as it directly addresses the goal of maintaining persistence and evading detection.

C. **T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
   - This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect malicious payloads. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly address the evasion of policy settings or the installation of a backdoor.

D. **T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
   - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates to gain unauthorized access. It does not directly relate to the evasion of policy settings or the installation of a backdoor.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is one that directly addresses the evasion of policy settings and the installation of a backdoor. **T1562-Impair Defenses** best fits this description.

Final Answer: B
