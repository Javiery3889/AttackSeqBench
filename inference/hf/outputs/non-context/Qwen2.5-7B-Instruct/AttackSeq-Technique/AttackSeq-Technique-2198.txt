Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Deployment of containers
     2. Use of obfuscation techniques
     3. Dumping the memory of the lsass process using procdump to obtain credential hashes

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. It does not directly relate to the deployment of containers or the use of obfuscation techniques. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
   - **T1562-Impair Defenses:** This technique involves actions that prevent the target from detecting, containing, or responding to the attack. While obfuscation can be a part of impairing defenses, it is more specific to the concealment of activities rather than a broader action.
   - **T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from tools used in the attack. While this could be part of the obfuscation, it is not directly related to the deployment of containers or the dumping of the lsass process.
   - **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves using legitimate system or application features to gain elevated privileges. Dumping the memory of the lsass process to obtain credential hashes is a method to escalate privileges, which aligns with this technique.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The deployment of containers and the use of obfuscation techniques are likely part of the initial compromise and evasion tactics.
   - The dumping of the lsass process to obtain credential hashes is a method to escalate privileges, which is best described by the T1548 technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
