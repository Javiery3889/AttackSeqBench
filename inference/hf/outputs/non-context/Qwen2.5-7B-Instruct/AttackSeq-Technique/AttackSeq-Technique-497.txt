Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence starts with payload stagers executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.
   - The next step in the sequence is the use of a PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection to inject the final payload DLL into memory.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves the use of scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.
   - **T1587.003-Digital Certificates:** This technique involves the use of digital certificates to validate the authenticity of the payload.
   - **T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves the use of a proxy to route network traffic.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves the use of shared modules to facilitate the execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1587.003-Digital Certificates** - This technique is not directly related to the execution of payload stagers or the injection of a final payload into memory. It is more about validating the payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy** - This technique is about routing network traffic through a proxy, which is not directly related to the execution of payload stagers or the injection of a final payload into memory.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique directly aligns with the first step in the sequence, where payload stagers are executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique is about using shared modules, which is not directly related to the execution of payload stagers or the injection of a final payload into memory.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, as it directly corresponds to the first step in the sequence where payload stagers are executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.

Final Answer: C
