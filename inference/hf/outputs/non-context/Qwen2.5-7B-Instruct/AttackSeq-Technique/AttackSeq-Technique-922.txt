Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers.
   - It also mentions the use of the Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting a service running on a remote system. Given that the question mentions identifying exploitable web servers, this technique fits well as it aligns with the initial step of finding a vulnerable service to exploit.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While this could be relevant, the specific mention of web servers suggests a more direct service exploitation rather than an application.
   - **C: T1480.001-Environmental Keying**
     - This technique involves using environmental factors to key the malware's behavior. It does not directly relate to the initial exploitation or the use of the Explosive Trojan.
   - **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves spreading malware through removable media. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, which focuses on network-based exploitation and remote execution.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the initial step is identifying exploitable web servers, which aligns with T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
   - The Explosive Trojan and the use of dynamically loaded DLL components suggest a method of remote execution, which is consistent with the exploitation of a remote service.

**Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
