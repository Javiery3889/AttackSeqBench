To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique used by the Phosphorus group for executing commands and downloading additional payloads via the PowerLess Backdoor, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the provided attack sequence.

1. **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While it is relevant to maintaining persistence and communication, it does not directly describe the execution of commands and downloading payloads.

2. **T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to run commands or scripts at a specified time. This aligns with the part of the sequence where scheduled tasks were used for persistence, but it does not directly address the execution of commands and downloading payloads.

3. **T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and using valid accounts to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to executing commands or downloading payloads via a backdoor.

4. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. This directly aligns with the need to execute commands and download additional payloads, which is a core function of the PowerLess Backdoor.

Given the context of the Phosphorus group's actions, the most relevant technique is the one that directly addresses the execution of commands and downloading of payloads, which is best described by T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
