To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The question mentions that APT41 accessed game production environments through lateral movement.
   - It then asks which technique most likely occurred before APT41 collected source code and digital certificates.

2. **Analyzing Each Option:**
   - **A: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a webhook. However, the question asks about a technique that would have occurred before collecting source code and digital certificates, not after exfiltrating them.
   - **B: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**
     - This technique involves using a hash of a user's password to gain access to systems without needing the actual password. This could be a method used to move laterally within the network, but it doesn't directly relate to collecting source code and digital certificates.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold in a network. This could be a method used to move laterally and gain access to different systems, but it doesn't directly relate to collecting source code and digital certificates.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain access to systems. Phishing could be used to obtain credentials or other information that could be used to move laterally and eventually collect source code and digital certificates.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question implies that the technique in question should be a method that would allow APT41 to gain access to the necessary credentials or information to collect source code and digital certificates.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a common method used to obtain credentials or other sensitive information, which can then be used to move laterally and access the required resources.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT41 used phishing (T1566) to obtain the necessary credentials or information to move laterally and collect source code and digital certificates.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
