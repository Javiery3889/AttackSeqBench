Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the adversary gained initial access through credential stuffing or password spraying. This is a common method of initial access.

2. **Gathering Information from Cloud Resources**: After gaining access, the adversary gathers information from cloud resources. This could involve various techniques, but the question does not specify which technique is used for this step.

3. **Scheduled Tasks for Executing Batch Files**: The question states that the adversary then relied on scheduled tasks for executing batch files. This is a technique to ensure that malicious activities are performed at regular intervals.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves the use of cron jobs to schedule tasks. Cron jobs are commonly used in Unix/Linux environments to run scripts or commands at specific times. This could be a plausible technique for scheduling batch files, but it is not the most direct or common technique for initial access or information gathering.

B. **T1590.005-IP Addresses**: This technique involves the use of IP addresses for various purposes, such as command and control (C2) communication. While this could be relevant for maintaining access, it is not directly related to scheduling tasks or executing batch files.

C. **T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves the adversary enumerating logs to gather information about the environment, which could be useful for understanding the network and identifying potential targets. However, it does not directly relate to scheduling tasks or executing batch files.

D. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the use of command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. This could be used to execute batch files, but it is more general and does not specifically address the scheduling aspect.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible technique that would occur before the adversary relies on scheduled tasks for executing batch files is the use of a command and scripting interpreter to execute the batch files.

**Final Answer: D**
