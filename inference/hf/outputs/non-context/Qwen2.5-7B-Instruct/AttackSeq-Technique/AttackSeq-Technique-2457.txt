To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Metamorfo evaded defenses by abusing legitimate signed binaries to load malicious code.**
   - This indicates that the malware or attacker used a legitimate signed binary to execute malicious code, which is a common technique to bypass security measures that check for digital signatures.

2. **Using public cloud infrastructure for malicious payload delivery.**
   - This suggests that the attacker leveraged cloud services to host and deliver the malicious payload, which is a modern and stealthy method to avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1204-User Execution**
   - This technique involves executing code or programs by convincing users to run them. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly address the use of legitimate signed binaries or cloud infrastructure.

B. **T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution**
   - This technique involves using a legitimate system binary to execute malicious code. This aligns well with the description of abusing a legitimate signed binary to load malicious code.

C. **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
   - This technique involves encoding payloads in non-standard ways to evade detection. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly address the use of legitimate signed binaries or cloud infrastructure.

D. **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**
   - This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to perform actions such as credential theft or privilege escalation. It does not align with the described use of legitimate signed binaries or cloud infrastructure.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described attack sequence is **T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution**.

Final Answer: B
