To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Backdoor Deployment**: The question mentions the use of BLUEAGAVE for command execution and JSPRAT for local command capabilities. These are both techniques for maintaining persistence and gaining initial access.

2. **Credential Theft and Network Access**: The question then states that FIN13 used ProcDump and Mimikatz for credential theft and network access. This indicates a move from initial access to gaining deeper access and control over the network.

3. **Identifying the Preceding Technique**: We need to find a technique that logically precedes the credential theft and network access phase. The techniques provided are:
   - **A: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This involves using legitimate mechanisms to gain elevated privileges. While it can be a step in the process, it doesn't directly precede credential theft.
   - **B: T1053.003-Cron**: This involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks. It's not directly related to credential theft or network access.
   - **C: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**: This involves using unsecured credentials, which is a direct step towards credential theft.
   - **D: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**: This involves using PAM to gain access, which is also a step towards gaining deeper access but not directly related to the credential theft phase.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most logical step that precedes credential theft and network access is the use of unsecured credentials. This would allow the attacker to gain the necessary credentials to perform the subsequent actions.

**Final Answer: C: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**
