Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Tropic Trooper's backdoor decrypted its configuration file.
     2. The backdoor connected using the SSL protocol.
     3. The backdoor leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question is asking about the technique that likely occurred before the backdoor used custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server. This implies we need to find a technique that would enable or facilitate the use of custom SSL libraries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**
     - This technique involves using spearphishing to deliver malware. While it could be a vector for initial compromise, it does not directly relate to the use of custom SSL libraries.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. It aligns with the use of custom SSL libraries for secure communication, as it suggests the use of encrypted channels.
   - **C: T1001.002-Steganography**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other data. It is not directly related to the use of custom SSL libraries for secure communication.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves the use of software deployment tools to install or update malware. It does not directly relate to the use of custom SSL libraries for secure communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is asking for a technique that would enable the use of custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel (B) directly relates to the use of encrypted channels, which aligns with the use of custom SSL libraries for secure communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
