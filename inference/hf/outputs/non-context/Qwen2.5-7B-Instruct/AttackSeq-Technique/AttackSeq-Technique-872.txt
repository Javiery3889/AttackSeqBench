Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that GreyEnergy operators used tools like Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials.
   - After gaining credentials, they redirected requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Gaining credentials (likely through credential dumping or other means).
   - Redirecting requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management:** This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to establish a remote management session. While it can be used for remote management, it doesn't directly align with the redirection of requests through internal C&C proxies.
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access or perform actions. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it doesn't directly address the redirection of requests.
   - **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain access or perform actions. It is not directly related to the redirection of requests through internal C&C proxies.
   - **D: T1070.004-File Deletion:** This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks or prevent detection. It is not related to the redirection of requests.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The redirection of requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication is most closely aligned with the technique of establishing a covert channel or command and control (C2) infrastructure. This is best represented by the technique of using internal proxies to route traffic, which is not directly listed in the ATT&CK framework but can be inferred from the context of the question.

Given the context and the need to align with the redirection of requests, the closest match in the ATT&CK framework would be a technique that involves establishing a covert channel or C2 infrastructure, which is not directly listed but can be inferred from the need to redirect traffic.

**Final Answer: None of the provided options directly match the described TTP, but if we must choose the closest, it would be A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management, as it involves remote management and could be part of the overall attack sequence. However, it is important to note that the question does not have a perfect match in the provided options.** 

If the question were to be rephrased to include a technique that involves establishing a covert channel or C2 infrastructure, it would be more accurately represented.
