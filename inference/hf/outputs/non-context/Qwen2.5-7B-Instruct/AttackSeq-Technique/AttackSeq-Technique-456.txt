Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     1. RIG Exploit kit distributing CEIDPageLock by exploiting a vulnerability.
     2. Tampering with the victim's browser homepage.
     3. Starting a kernel-mode driver for persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The RIG Exploit kit is a known exploit kit that uses vulnerabilities to deliver malware.
   - CEIDPageLock is a type of malware that changes the browser homepage.
   - The kernel-mode driver is used for persistence, meaning the malware remains active even after the system restarts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a drive-by download, which aligns with the RIG Exploit kit distributing malware.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This is the same as A, so it's redundant.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or control the victim's system. It does not directly align with the sequence of events described.
   - **D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves using remote access software to gain access to a system. It is more related to post-exploitation activities rather than the initial exploitation and persistence.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The RIG Exploit kit exploiting a vulnerability and distributing malware (CEIDPageLock) fits the description of T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
   - Tampering with the browser homepage is a direct result of the malware being installed.
   - Starting a kernel-mode driver for persistence is the next step in maintaining control over the system.

Given the sequence of events and the alignment with the ATT&CK framework, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: A**
