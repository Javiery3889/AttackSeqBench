Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Waterbear (a hypothetical malware) uses API hooking to evade detection by modifying functions in memory.
   - After this evasion technique, the malware connects to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is API hooking (T1112.003).
   - The subsequent TTP involves connecting to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. It does not directly relate to receiving external payloads or files.
   - **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using software deployment tools to install or update software. It does not directly relate to receiving external payloads or files.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or data from an external source to an internal network. This aligns well with the scenario of receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to receiving external payloads or files.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

Final Answer: C
