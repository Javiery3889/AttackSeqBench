Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware collected stored passwords and access tokens from the registry.
   - The execution exploit used CVE-2017-11882.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was used to remove forensic evidence after these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves using a legitimate application or service to execute malicious code. This does not fit the context of removing forensic evidence.
   - **T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking:** This technique involves modifying the dynamic linker to load a malicious library. This also does not fit the context of removing forensic evidence.
   - **T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching:** This technique involves using sudo to gain elevated privileges and then using sudo caching to maintain those privileges. This does not fit the context of removing forensic evidence.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This fits the context of removing forensic evidence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution** - This technique is about executing code, not removing evidence.
   - **B: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking** - This technique is about modifying the dynamic linker, not removing evidence.
   - **C: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching** - This technique is about maintaining elevated privileges, not removing evidence.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal** - This technique is about removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise, which aligns with the context of removing forensic evidence.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware collected stored passwords and access tokens, which indicates a data collection TTP.
   - The exploit used CVE-2017-11882, which is a specific vulnerability.
   - The question asks about removing forensic evidence, which aligns with the T1070-Indicator Removal technique.
   - None of the other techniques (T1204, T1574.006, T1548.003) fit the context of removing forensic evidence.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
