Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The backdoor (Vyveva) collects files from the system and newly inserted removable media.
   - The collected data is then sent to the C&C (Command and Control) server in an encrypted manner.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The backdoor collects data.
   - The collected data is then exfiltrated over a C2 channel in an encrypted manner.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**
     - This technique involves blocking indicators of compromise to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the collection or exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves the automated collection of data. This aligns with the backdoor collecting files from the system and removable media.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel. While this is part of the sequence, it does not describe the action that occurs before the exfiltration.
   - **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves archiving the collected data before exfiltration. This is a plausible step that would occur after the data is collected and before it is sent to the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor first collects data (T1119-Automated Collection).
   - The collected data is then archived (T1560-Archive Collected Data).
   - Finally, the archived data is exfiltrated over the C2 channel (T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is that the backdoor first collects data and then archives it before exfiltrating it.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: T1560-Archive Collected Data.

Final Answer: D
