To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique that would prevent detection and forensic analysis on compromised systems, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the described sequence of TTPs.

1. **T1543 - Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to hide malicious activity. While it can help in evading detection, it does not directly address the prevention of forensic analysis.

2. **T1070 - Indicator Removal**: This technique focuses on removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection by security tools and forensic analysis. It directly addresses the prevention of detection and forensic analysis, which aligns well with the question's requirement.

3. **T1553 - Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves compromising or subverting trust controls, such as security certificates or digital signatures, to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly prevent detection and forensic analysis.

4. **T1078 - Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid user accounts to hide malicious activity. It can help in evading detection but does not directly address the prevention of forensic analysis.

Given the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that aligns with the requirement to prevent detection and forensic analysis is T1070 - Indicator Removal.

**Final Answer: B**
