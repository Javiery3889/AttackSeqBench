Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" in memory to execute Shellcode script functionalities without writing to the hard disk.
   - This is followed by multi-beacon communication to evade detection.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059.006-Python**
     - This technique involves using Python to execute code in memory. However, the question specifically mentions "powershell.exe" and not Python.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. "powershell.exe" is a command and scripting interpreter, so this could be a plausible choice.
   - **C: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**
     - This technique involves wiping the disk structure, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the question. The attack did not write to the hard disk and then wiped it.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While this could be part of the multi-beacon communication, it does not directly follow the use of "powershell.exe" in memory.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that "powershell.exe" was used in memory to execute Shellcode script functionalities without writing to the hard disk. This aligns with the use of a command and scripting interpreter.
   - The next step in the sequence is multi-beacon communication, which is a method to evade detection.

Given the sequence and the techniques involved, the most plausible answer is the one that directly follows the use of "powershell.exe" in memory.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
