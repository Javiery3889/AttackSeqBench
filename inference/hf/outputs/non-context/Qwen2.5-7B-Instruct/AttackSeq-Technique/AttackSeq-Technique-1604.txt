Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The question mentions persistence through a shortcut in the Windows startup folder pointing to a VBE startup script. This aligns with the T1543.003 - Persistence via File System technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Evading Defenses**: The evasion technique involves detecting virtualization or malware analysis tools. This aligns with T1082 - Evasion of Host-based Defenses.

3. **Communication with C&C Server**: The communication involves JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers. This suggests a method of exfiltrating or receiving data in a way that is less likely to be detected by network monitoring tools.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1113 - Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not related to the communication aspect described in the question.

B. **T1568.003 - DNS Calculation**: This technique involves calculating domain names from other data, which is not directly related to the JSON-encoded objects and public services mentioned.

C. **T1102 - Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service for command and control (C&C) communication. While it is related to web services, it does not specifically address the use of JSON-encoded objects and public services as dead drop resolvers.

D. **T1568 - Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names, which can be used to leverage public services as dead drop resolvers. The use of JSON-encoded objects for communication aligns well with this technique, as it can be used to encode and decode data in a way that is less likely to be detected.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers for communication, which aligns with T1568 - Dynamic Resolution.

Final Answer: D
