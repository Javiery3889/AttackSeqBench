Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers use CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' to download additional payloads.
   - The key TTP here is the use of a benign tool (CertUtil.exe) to disguise malicious activity, which is a form of evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using legitimate commands or scripts to execute malicious code. While it is related to using legitimate tools for malicious purposes, it does not specifically address the disguise aspect mentioned in the question.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves hiding the true nature of an attack by using legitimate files, processes, or network traffic to disguise malicious activity. This aligns closely with the scenario where CertUtil.exe is disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or altering indicators of an attack to avoid detection. While this is related to evasion, it does not specifically address the disguise of a benign tool as a malicious one.
   - **D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection:** This technique involves modifying the Security Identifier (SID) history to evade detection. This is not directly related to the disguise of a benign tool as a malicious one.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a benign tool (CertUtil.exe) is used to disguise malicious activity, which is a form of masquerading.
   - T1036-Masquerading (B) directly addresses the use of a legitimate file or process to disguise malicious activity, which matches the scenario described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading**
