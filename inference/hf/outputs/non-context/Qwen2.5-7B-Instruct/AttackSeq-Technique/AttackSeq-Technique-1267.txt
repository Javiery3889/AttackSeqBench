Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions a sequence of techniques used in an attack:
     1. Blind Eagle utilized a JavaScript downloader.
     2. The JavaScript downloader employed ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
     3. The attacker achieved persistence with a VBScript placed in the Startup folder.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM):**
     - This technique involves the use of Component Object Model (COM) to execute code. The question mentions the use of ActiveXObject, which is a COM object. This technique aligns well with the use of ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish command and control channels. It does not directly align with the use of ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules:**
     - This technique involves the use of shared modules to execute code. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly align with the use of ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **D: T1218.007-Msiexec:**
     - This technique involves the use of the msiexec command to install and execute payloads. It does not directly align with the use of ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands, which aligns with the use of Component Object Model (COM).

**Final Answer: A: T1559.001-Component Object Model**
