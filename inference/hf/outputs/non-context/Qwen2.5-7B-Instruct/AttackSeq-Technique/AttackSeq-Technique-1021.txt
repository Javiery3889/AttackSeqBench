Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malicious macros were injected into Word and Excel documents and sent via emails to other targets within the same organization.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are the injection of malicious macros and the use of emails with malicious attachments.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1546.002-Screensaver** - This technique involves using a screensaver to execute malicious code. It does not align with the scenario of using malicious macros in documents.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves convincing a user to execute a program or script. While it could be relevant, it is more general and does not specifically address the use of macros in documents.
   - **C: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)** - This technique involves using DCOM to execute code. It is not directly related to the use of macros in documents.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing** - This technique involves sending malicious content to internal users, which aligns with the scenario of sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The scenario describes the use of malicious macros in documents and emails to other internal targets.
   - T1534-Internal Spearphishing (D) directly addresses the use of emails with malicious content to internal users, which fits the described scenario.
   - The other techniques (A, B, and C) do not specifically address the use of macros in documents or the internal nature of the attack.

**Final Answer: D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
