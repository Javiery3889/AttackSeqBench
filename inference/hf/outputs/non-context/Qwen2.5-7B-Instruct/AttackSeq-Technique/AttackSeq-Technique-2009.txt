To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Reconnaissance and Open-Source Intelligence Gathering**: This is the initial phase where adversaries gather information about potential targets.
2. **Installation of BlackEnergy 3**: This is the final phase mentioned in the question, which is a malware installation.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves the use of valid user accounts to gain access to a system. It is a common step after reconnaissance to find accounts that can be used to escalate privileges or gain access to the network.

B. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves the use of malicious emails or other forms of social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. Phishing is a common method to gain initial access to a system, often following reconnaissance.

C. **T1559.003-XPC Services**: This technique involves the use of malicious or unauthorized XPC (Cross Process Communication) services to execute code or perform actions on a system. This is a method to execute code, but it is not typically the first step after reconnaissance.

D. **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves the execution of code or commands by a user, often through social engineering or other means. While this is a common technique, it is more likely to be a step after gaining initial access rather than the first step after reconnaissance.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible step after reconnaissance and before malware installation would be gaining initial access through a method that could trick users or leverage existing accounts. Phishing (T1566) is a common and effective method for this purpose.

**Final Answer: B**
