Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that CosmicDuke used Discovery techniques to identify targeted files, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names.
   - It also states that CosmicDuke gathered information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1127.002-ClickOnce** - This technique involves using the ClickOnce protocol to deploy and update applications. It does not align with the described behavior of identifying and gathering information from removable drives.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking** - This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials. It does not match the described behavior of identifying and gathering information from removable drives.
   - **C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates** - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates. It does not align with the described behavior of identifying and gathering information from removable drives.
   - **D: T1025-Data from Removable Media** - This technique involves accessing data from removable media, which aligns with the described behavior of gathering information from removable drives. The mention of skipping certain file types could imply selective data access, which is a plausible behavior for this technique.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke is identifying and gathering information from removable drives, which is directly aligned with the T1025-Data from Removable Media technique.
   - The additional detail about skipping certain file types is consistent with selective data access, which is a common behavior in this technique.
   - None of the other techniques (A, B, or C) describe the behavior of accessing data from removable media.

**Final Answer: D**
