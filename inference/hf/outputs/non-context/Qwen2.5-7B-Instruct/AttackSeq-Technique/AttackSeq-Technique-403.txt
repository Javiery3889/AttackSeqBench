Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described includes:
     - A malicious Excel file prompting the victim to enable Macro content.
     - Execution of the payload using `ShellExecute` under `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`.
     - The malware then hides from debuggers like Ollydbg and IDA.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick the user into performing an action that results in the compromise of the system. While this could be part of the initial attack vector, it does not directly relate to the malware's actions after execution.
   - **B: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller** - This technique involves an attacker compromising a domain controller to gain control over the network. This is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.
   - **C: T1622-Debugger Evasion** - This technique involves the malware taking steps to avoid being debugged, which aligns with the described action of hiding from debuggers like Ollydbg and IDA.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** - This technique involves the attacker gathering information about the system owner or user, which is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that start with a social engineering attack (malicious Excel file) and then move to execution and finally to evasion techniques.
   - The evasion techniques mentioned (hiding from debuggers) are a step that occurs after the malware has been executed and is running on the system.
   - Among the given options, only T1622-Debugger Evasion directly aligns with the described action of hiding from debuggers.

**Final Answer: C: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
