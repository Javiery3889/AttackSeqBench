To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Given TTPs:**
   - The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - The communication was encrypted with RC4 and encoded with Base64.
   - This indicates a C2 (Command and Control) channel is established and used for command and control operations.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1505-Server Software Component**
     - This technique involves using a software component that is already present on the target system. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data but rather to the use of existing software.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves using the same C2 channel that was established for command and control to exfiltrate data. Given that the Rising Sun implant already uses a C2 channel for communication, it is plausible that the same channel could be used for data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data but rather to the execution of commands.
   - **D: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services. While this is a valid method for data exfiltration, it does not directly align with the use of the existing C2 channel for communication.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the Rising Sun implant uses a C2 channel for communication, which is established using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and encoded with Base64.
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to use the same C2 channel for both command and control and data exfiltration.
   - Among the given choices, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel directly aligns with the use of the existing C2 channel for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
