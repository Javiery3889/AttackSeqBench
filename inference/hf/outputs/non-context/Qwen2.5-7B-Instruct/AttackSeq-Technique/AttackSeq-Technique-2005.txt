Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the KopiLuwak backdoor began communicating with two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands.
   - Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and saves the output for use in subsequent phases.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The primary TTP here is the communication between the backdoor and the compromised websites.
   - The communication is likely to be done in a way that avoids detection, possibly by using legitimate services or protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1135-Network Share Discovery** - This technique involves discovering accessible network shares, which is not directly related to the communication with websites.
   - **B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling** - This technique involves using one protocol to hide the use of another protocol. This could be relevant if the backdoor is using a legitimate protocol to communicate with the command and control (C2) servers.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using a web service to exfiltrate data or receive commands. This is directly related to the communication with the compromised websites.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run at a later time. This is not directly related to the communication with websites.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the backdoor is communicating with two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands.
   - The most plausible technique here is T1102-Web Service, as it directly involves using a web service for communication.
   - While T1572-Protocol Tunneling could also be relevant, T1102 is more specific to the communication with websites, which aligns better with the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
