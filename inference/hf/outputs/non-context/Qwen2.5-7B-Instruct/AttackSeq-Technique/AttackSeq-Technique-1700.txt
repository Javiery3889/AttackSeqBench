To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Lateral Movement**: The question mentions that Bvp47 (a known malware) conducted lateral movement by connecting to V2's SMB service from V1. This is a common technique used by malware to move laterally within a network.

2. **Sensitive Operations**: After the lateral movement, Bvp47 performed sensitive operations. This implies that the malware is now in a position to carry out actions that could be harmful or unauthorized.

3. **Covert Communication**: The question states that Bvp47 established covert communication with a command server. This suggests that the malware is trying to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to tunnel other protocols. While this could be a method to establish covert communication, it is not the most direct or common method for maintaining persistent communication with a command server.

B. **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves using legitimate mechanisms to elevate privileges or control. This is more about gaining higher access levels rather than establishing covert communication.

C. **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using network traffic to signal between systems. This could be a plausible method for establishing covert communication, as it uses normal-looking traffic to hide malicious activities.

D. **T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache to redirect traffic. While this can be used to intercept or manipulate traffic, it is not the most direct method for establishing persistent covert communication.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for establishing covert communication with a command server is **T1205-Traffic Signaling**. This technique aligns well with the need to maintain stealth and persistence in network communications.

**Final Answer: C**
