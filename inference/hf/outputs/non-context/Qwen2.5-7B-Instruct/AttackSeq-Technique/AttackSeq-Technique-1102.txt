To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Winnti implant registration as a service**: This indicates persistence, which is a common technique used by adversaries to maintain access to a system over a long period. This is covered by T1543.003 - Service.

2. **C&C communication via social network profiles and collaborative document editing sites**: This suggests the use of less conventional and harder-to-detect communication channels. Social network profiles and collaborative document editing sites are not typical C&C communication methods, which makes this a unique and sophisticated approach.

3. **Identifying the preceding TTP**: We need to find a TTP that would facilitate the use of these unconventional communication channels. Let's evaluate each option:

   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files to avoid detection. While it can be used to hide the implant or its communications, it does not directly relate to the use of social networks or collaborative document editing sites for C&C.
   
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the C2 server. However, the question specifies the use of social network profiles and collaborative document editing sites, which are not web services.
   
   - **C: T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing**: This technique involves using a legitimate process as a parent process to hide the implant. While it can help in maintaining persistence and evading detection, it does not directly relate to the use of social networks or collaborative document editing sites for C&C.
   
   - **D: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves making the implant appear as a legitimate process or file. While it can help in evading detection, it does not directly relate to the use of social networks or collaborative document editing sites for C&C.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible TTP that would precede the use of social network profiles and collaborative document editing sites for C&C communication is one that helps in evading detection and making the communication appear legitimate or less suspicious. **T1036-Masquerading** (D) is the most relevant because it can help the adversary make the C&C communication appear as normal traffic, thus using social networks and collaborative document editing sites without raising suspicion.

**Final Answer: D: T1036-Masquerading**
