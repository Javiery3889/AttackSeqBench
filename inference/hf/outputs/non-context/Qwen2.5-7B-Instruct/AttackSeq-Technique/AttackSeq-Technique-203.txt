Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that "FamousSparrow injected the encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes." This refers to the T1055-Process Injection technique.
   - The question also mentions that the group used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials from compromised systems. This refers to the T1003-Obtain Credentials technique.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves gathering data from local systems, which is not directly related to the injection of shellcode or credential dumping.
   - **B: T1612-Build Image on Host**
     - This technique involves building an image on the host, which is not directly related to the injection of shellcode or credential dumping.
   - **C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering network shares, which is not directly related to the injection of shellcode or credential dumping.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process, which directly aligns with the first part of the sequence where the shellcode is injected into processes.

3. **Determine the Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs should logically follow the order of events described in the question. After the process injection (T1055), the next step would be to use the injected code to perform actions such as credential dumping (T1003).

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- T1055-Process Injection (shellcode injection)
- T1003-Obtain Credentials (using custom Mimikatz to dump credentials)

Therefore, the answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the credential dumping step is:

Final Answer: D: T1055-Process Injection
