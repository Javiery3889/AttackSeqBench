Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an adversary gains access to a victim's network entry points (like a VPN or Citrix) after performing credential stuffing against remote services.
   - The goal is to identify which MITRE ATT&CK technique facilitated this access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves the use of valid user accounts to gain access to systems. Credential stuffing is a method of using a list of stolen credentials to try and gain access to systems. Therefore, T1078 aligns well with the described scenario.
   - **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**
     - This technique is about hiding email content from security tools. It does not directly relate to gaining access through credential stuffing.
   - **C: T1200-Hardware Additions**
     - This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access. It is not related to the use of stolen credentials.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system to identify potential vulnerabilities. While it can be a part of the overall attack, it does not directly facilitate the use of stolen credentials to gain access.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions "credential stuffing," which is a method of using stolen credentials to gain access.
   - T1078-Valid Accounts directly describes the use of valid user accounts (which can be stolen credentials) to gain access to systems.
   - The other techniques do not align with the specific method of credential stuffing.

**Final Answer: A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
