To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers used a new version of the Infy malware to target a single Canadian victim.
   - After the malware was used, the attackers exfiltrated encrypted and base64-encoded data, which included keylogger logs and information about the victim computer.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1543.001-Launch Agent**
     - This technique involves the use of a launch agent to maintain persistence on a system. While this could be a step in the attack, it does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1071.004-DNS**
     - This technique involves the use of DNS for data exfiltration. However, the question specifies that the data was exfiltrated over an alternative protocol, not necessarily DNS.
   - **C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of an alternative protocol for data exfiltration, which aligns with the description in the question where the data was exfiltrated using an alternative protocol (encrypted and base64-encoded).
   - **D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This technique involves the use of dynamic DNS resolution to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. While it could be a part of the attack, it does not directly address the exfiltration method described.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the attackers exfiltrated data using an alternative protocol, which is encrypted and base64-encoded.
   - Among the given choices, T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol is the only technique that directly addresses the method of exfiltration described in the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
