Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Infamous Chisel first collects predefined files of interest, then enumerates data directories and gathers system information, and finally exfiltrates the files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections. The task is to identify which ATT&CK technique enables the enumeration of data directories and gathering of system information.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1606.001-Web Cookies**: This technique involves the use of web cookies to maintain persistence or session information. It does not align with the task of enumerating data directories and gathering system information.
- **B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of protocols other than those used for application data transfer (e.g., HTTP, FTP) for data exfiltration. It does not fit the context of the initial data collection and directory enumeration.
- **C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This technique involves the use of cloud storage accounts for data exfiltration. It is not relevant to the initial data collection and directory enumeration phase.
- **D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves the discovery of files and directories on a system, which aligns perfectly with the task of enumerating data directories and gathering system information.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the malware first needs to enumerate data directories and gather system information before exfiltrating the files.
- T1083-File and Directory Discovery is the only technique that directly addresses the need to discover and gather information about files and directories on the system.
- The other techniques (T1606.001, T1095, and T1087.004) are related to different stages of the attack lifecycle, such as persistence, data exfiltration, and cloud storage, respectively.

Final Answer: D
