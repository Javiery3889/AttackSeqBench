To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the creation of the malicious domain falcancoin.io to distribute Bankshot implants, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1550.001-Application Access Token**: This technique involves the use of access tokens to gain access to applications or services. While this could be a step in the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the creation of a domain or the distribution of implants.

2. **T1596.005-Scan Databases**: This technique involves scanning databases to gather information. While it could be part of the reconnaissance phase, it doesn't directly lead to the creation of a domain or the distribution of implants.

3. **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim, such as names, email addresses, and other personal details. This information could be used to create a more convincing domain name (e.g., falcancoin.io) and to tailor the attack to the victim. This step logically precedes the creation of a domain and the distribution of implants.

4. **T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing the tools and capabilities needed for the attack. While this is a crucial step, it doesn't directly relate to the creation of a domain or the distribution of implants.

Given the context of the attack sequence, the most plausible sequence would be to gather as much information about the victim as possible before creating a domain and distributing implants. This ensures that the domain appears legitimate and increases the likelihood of successful distribution.

**Final Answer: C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
