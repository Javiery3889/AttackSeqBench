Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where TDrop2 malware has already retrieved a second-stage payload disguised as an image file.
   - The next step in the sequence is to collect information about specific paths on the infected system during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** - This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a network. It does not fit the context of collecting information about paths on the infected system.
   - **B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about files and directories on a system. It aligns well with the need to collect information about specific paths on the infected system.
   - **C: T1069.002-Domain Groups** - This technique involves the use of domain groups for privilege escalation or lateral movement. It does not fit the context of collecting information about paths on the infected system.
   - **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation** - This technique involves the obfuscation of data to evade detection. It does not fit the context of collecting information about paths on the infected system.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the next step is to collect information about specific paths on the infected system during the reconnaissance phase.
   - Among the given options, T1083-File and Directory Discovery (B) is the only technique that directly involves gathering information about files and directories, which aligns with the need to collect information about specific paths on the infected system.

**Final Answer: B**
