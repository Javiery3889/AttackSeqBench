Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Exploiting a vulnerability in SharePoint to install the AntSword webshell**: This indicates initial access and persistence.
2. **Achieving credential access using Mimikatz to dump credentials**: This suggests the actors have gained a foothold and are now looking to escalate privileges and gather more information.

Given that the actors are assessing the content of the compromised system, the next logical step would be to gather information about the system's files and directories to understand its structure and contents. This aligns with the ATT&CK technique T1083-File and Directory Discovery.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the files and directories on a system, which fits the scenario of assessing the content of the compromised system.
- **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or hide malicious activity. It does not align with the context of assessing the system's content.
- **C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**: This technique involves compromising a cloud account, which is not relevant to the context of assessing the local system's content.
- **D: T1036.006-Space after Filename**: This technique involves using a space after a filename to bypass certain security mechanisms, which is not relevant to the context of assessing the system's content.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
