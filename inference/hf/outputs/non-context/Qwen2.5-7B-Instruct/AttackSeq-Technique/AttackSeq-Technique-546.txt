Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Visitors to compromised websites.
     - Browser fingerprinting exploits for initial access.
     - Malicious scripts communicating with C&C servers using HTTPS.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely involved acquiring domain names and renting servers to support the attack.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using malicious content to entice victims to provide sensitive information. It does not directly involve acquiring domain names or renting servers.
   - **B: T1561-Disk Wipe** - This technique involves erasing data from a disk. It is not related to acquiring domain names or renting servers.
   - **C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure** - This technique involves acquiring or establishing infrastructure to support the attack, which could include domain names and servers. This aligns with the need to have a domain name and server for the malicious scripts to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **D: T1584.006-Web Services** - This technique involves using web services to host malicious content. While it is related to hosting content, it does not specifically mention acquiring domain names or renting servers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies the need to acquire domain names and rent servers, which are essential for hosting the malicious content and ensuring communication with the C&C servers.
   - T1583-Acquire Infrastructure directly addresses the need to acquire and establish the necessary infrastructure, including domain names and servers.

**Final Answer: C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
