To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the answer choices.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
- **Initial Access**: BlackEnergy 3 malware gained initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
- **Next Likely TTP**: We need to identify the next most likely technique that would follow gaining initial access.

### Answer Choices:
A. **T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique involves the use of container orchestration to run malicious code. It is not directly related to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.

B. **T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used by the attacker, such as C2 servers, to avoid detection. It is a common step after gaining initial access to establish a foothold and maintain persistence.

C. **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious payload. While it is a common technique, it is more likely to be used as a method of initial access rather than the next step after gaining initial access.

D. **T1622-Debugger Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by debuggers, which is a defensive measure to avoid analysis. It is not directly related to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access**: The malware has already exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to gain initial access.
2. **Next Step**: After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to establish a foothold and avoid detection. Hiding the infrastructure used for command and control (C2) is a common practice to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office is to hide the infrastructure used by the attacker.

**Final Answer: B - T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
