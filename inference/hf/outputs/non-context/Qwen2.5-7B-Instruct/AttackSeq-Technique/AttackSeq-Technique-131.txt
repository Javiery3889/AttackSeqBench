To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed APT-TOCS to establish initial access to the targeted systems before executing Shellcode scripts in memory, we need to analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves the use of compromised domain accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be a method of establishing initial access, it is more about lateral movement and privilege escalation rather than the initial entry point.

2. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access. This is a common method for initial access, especially in scenarios where the target has publicly accessible services that are not properly secured.

3. **T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique is about using or manipulating inter-process communication mechanisms to achieve a goal. It is not directly related to the initial access but rather to maintaining persistence or lateral movement.

4. **T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows registry to gain elevated privileges. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it is not typically the initial method of gaining access to a system.

Given the context of the question, which mentions the execution of Shellcode scripts in memory for network communication via Beacon mode, the most plausible initial access technique would be one that directly exploits a vulnerability to gain entry into the system. This aligns with the description of T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application, as it is a common method for attackers to initially compromise a system.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
