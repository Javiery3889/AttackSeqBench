To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

1. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - The attack sequence starts with an AutoIt downloader.
   - The AutoIt downloader uses WMI objects to perform reconnaissance and gather process lists.
   - The next step in the sequence is to identify what TTP would logically follow this reconnaissance phase.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices on the target system. While it is a valid TTP, it does not directly follow the gathering of process lists, which is more about system information.
   - **B: T1547.015-Login Items**: This technique involves adding items to the list of items that are executed when a user logs in. This is more about persistence and not directly related to the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as system configuration, installed software, and network details. This aligns well with the gathering of process lists and further system information.
   - **D: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**: This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which is more about network reconnaissance rather than system information discovery.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The AutoIt downloader uses WMI to gather process lists, which is a form of system information discovery.
   - The next logical step would be to gather more detailed system information, such as system configuration, installed software, and network details, which is covered by T1082-System Information Discovery.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1082-System Information Discovery, as it directly follows the gathering of process lists and provides more detailed system information.

Final Answer: C
