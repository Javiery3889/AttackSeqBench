Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the malware creates and executes a malicious PE file using concatenated ASCII character codes in a function.
   - The goal is to hide its activities from debuggers and sandboxes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key TTP here is the obfuscation of the malicious PE file, likely to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves encoding or encrypting files to make them less recognizable. This aligns with the use of concatenated ASCII character codes to create a PE file, which is a form of obfuscation.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard network protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not align with the described TTP of obfuscating the PE file.
   - **C: T1564.009-Resource Forking:** This technique involves splitting a file into multiple parts, which is not directly related to the described TTP of obfuscating the PE file.
   - **D: T1610-Deploy Container:** This technique involves using containers to host and run malicious code. It does not align with the described TTP of obfuscating the PE file.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.

Final Answer: A
