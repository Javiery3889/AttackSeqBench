Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where public exploits (like CVE-2019-19781) are used to deploy malware on vulnerable systems.
   - The next step in the sequence is APT29 maintaining persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials and using anonymizing services.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is deploying public exploits.
   - The second TTP is obtaining legitimate credentials.
   - The third TTP is using anonymizing services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
     - This technique involves the use of legitimate identities to blend in with normal user activity. While it could be part of the sequence, it doesn't directly follow the deployment of exploits and obtaining credentials.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain communication. While it could be used after obtaining credentials, it doesn't directly follow the deployment of exploits and obtaining credentials.
   - **C: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into web pages or other documents. It doesn't directly follow the deployment of exploits and obtaining credentials.
   - **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves the use of valid accounts to gain access to systems. This directly follows the deployment of exploits and obtaining credentials, as it describes the use of the obtained credentials to maintain persistent access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, where obtaining legitimate credentials (T1078-Valid Accounts) is the step that follows the deployment of public exploits, is best represented by answer choice D.

Final Answer: D: T1078-Valid Accounts
