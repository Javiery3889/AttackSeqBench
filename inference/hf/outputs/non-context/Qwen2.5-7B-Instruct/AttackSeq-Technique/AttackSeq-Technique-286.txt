To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack begins with spear-phishing documents or watering hole attacks. This is a common initial access technique.

2. **Dropping Elephant Backdoor**: The question states that the Dropping Elephant backdoor executes encoded blobs to evade detection. This implies that the backdoor itself is a payload that is dropped after initial access.

3. **Encoded Blobs**: The backdoor drops encoded blobs, which suggests that there is a need to decode or deobfuscate these blobs before they can be executed.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique directly aligns with the need to decode or deobfuscate the encoded blobs that the Dropping Elephant backdoor drops. This is a logical step that would occur before the execution of the backdoor.

- **B: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**: This technique involves using file transfer protocols to transfer files. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the decoding of the blobs dropped by the backdoor.

- **C: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: This technique involves smuggling data in HTML content. It is not directly related to the decoding of the blobs dropped by the backdoor.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for data exfiltration or command and control. It is not directly related to the decoding of the blobs dropped by the backdoor.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that involves decoding the blobs dropped by the backdoor.

**Final Answer: A: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
