Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that SideCopy used modular plugins for keylogging and file enumeration.
   - It specifically asks about the technique used for harvesting credentials by targeting access to Kavach, an MFA app.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The primary goal is to harvest credentials.
   - The method involves targeting an MFA app (Kavach).

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves persisting malware by adding it to the system's boot process or startup programs. While it can be used to ensure the malware runs, it does not directly target credentials or MFA apps.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, which can be used for keylogging. Keylogging is a method to harvest credentials, making this a strong candidate.
   - **C: T1213.001-Confluence**
     - This technique is related to Confluence, a collaboration tool, and does not align with the context of targeting credentials or MFA apps.
   - **D: T1115-Clipboard Data**
     - This technique involves stealing data from the clipboard. While it can be used to capture sensitive information, it is not as directly related to keylogging or harvesting credentials as input capture.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on harvesting credentials, which aligns with keylogging.
   - Keylogging is a method of capturing user input, which is directly related to T1056-Input Capture.
   - T1056-Input Capture is the most relevant technique for capturing credentials, especially when targeting an MFA app like Kavach.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
