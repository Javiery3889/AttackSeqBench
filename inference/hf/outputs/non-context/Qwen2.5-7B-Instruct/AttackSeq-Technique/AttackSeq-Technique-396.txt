Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a Linux Turla sample intercepts incoming packets without root access and then executes commands via '/bin/sh -c'.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**
     - This technique involves modifying the PATH environment variable to execute malicious code. However, the question already mentions that the sample executed commands via '/bin/sh -c', which is a direct command execution method, not necessarily involving the PATH variable.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the command execution via '/bin/sh -c'.
   - **C: T1053.003-Cron**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks using cron. While this could be a step after command execution, it is not directly related to the immediate execution via '/bin/sh -c'.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. The question already mentions the use of '/bin/sh -c', which is a command and scripting interpreter. Therefore, this technique is directly related to the immediate action described.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the use of '/bin/sh -c' for command execution.
   - '/bin/sh -c' is a command and scripting interpreter.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (D) directly corresponds to the use of '/bin/sh -c'.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
