Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - APT41 used rootkits and MBR bootkits for persistence.
   - These bootkits were executed before the operating system initializes, adding stealth.
   - Credentials were accessed using keyloggers after the system had booted.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**
     - This technique involves the use of messaging applications to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the sequence of TTPs described, as it comes after the system has booted and credentials have been accessed.
   - **B: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - This technique involves using time-based triggers to evade detection. While it could be a part of the overall strategy, it does not directly follow the sequence of TTPs described.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying containers to host malicious code. It does not align with the sequence of TTPs described, as it is not related to persistence or credential access.
   - **D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
     - This technique involves executing code before the operating system has fully booted. This aligns with the use of MBR bootkits and rootkits, which are executed before the OS initializes.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves persistence and stealth through MBR bootkits and rootkits, which are executed before the OS boots.
   - After the system has booted, keyloggers are used to access credentials.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
