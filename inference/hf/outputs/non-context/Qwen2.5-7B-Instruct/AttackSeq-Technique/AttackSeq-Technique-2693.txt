Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Elfin used PowerShell commands and other methods to bypass logging on infected systems.
   - This is followed by the deployment of DarkComet to extract credentials from compromised systems.
   - We need to find a technique that logically occurs between these two steps.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves the attacker actively scanning the network or system to gather information. It does not directly relate to bypassing logging or deploying a tool to extract credentials.
   - **B: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging**
     - This technique involves the attacker using legitimate processes to hide malicious activity. While it can be used for defense evasion, it does not directly relate to bypassing logging or deploying a tool to extract credentials.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
     - This technique involves the attacker taking actions to reduce the effectiveness of security controls, such as disabling or modifying security software. This aligns well with bypassing logging, which is a form of security control.
   - **D: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions on services to gain unauthorized access. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it does not directly relate to bypassing logging or deploying a tool to extract credentials.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the technique should occur after bypassing logging and before deploying DarkComet to extract credentials.
   - **T1562-Impair Defenses** (C) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the action of bypassing logging, which is a form of impairing defenses.

**Final Answer: C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
