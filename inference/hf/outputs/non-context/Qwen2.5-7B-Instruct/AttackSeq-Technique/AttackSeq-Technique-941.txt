To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the first stage of Zebrocy components was delivered via spearphishing, which is a common method for achieving initial access to a victim's machine.

2. **Enabling Command and Control**: After gaining initial access, the next step would be to establish a method to issue commands and execute subsequent malware stages. This is typically done through a Command and Scripting Interpreter (C2) to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1204.002-Malicious File**: This technique involves the use of a malicious file to deliver malware. While this could be part of the initial payload, it does not directly enable the issuance of commands and execution of subsequent stages.

B. **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative methods to communicate with the C2 server in case the primary method is detected or blocked. While this is a useful technique for maintaining persistence, it is not the immediate step after initial access.

C. **T1218.010-Regsvr32**: This technique involves using the `regsvr32` command to load a DLL, which can be used to execute arbitrary code. While this can be a method to execute malware, it is more of a payload delivery mechanism rather than a direct method for issuing commands and executing subsequent stages.

D. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute commands. This is the most direct method for enabling Sednit's operators to issue commands and execute subsequent malware stages on the victim's machine after initial access.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access is achieved via spearphishing.
2. The next step is to enable the ability to issue commands and execute subsequent stages.
3. T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter directly supports this by providing a method to execute commands and scripts, which is essential for maintaining control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.
