Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Cinobi (a hypothetical malware or threat actor) steals banking credentials through form-grabbing and web traffic modification.
   - The next step in the sequence is communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server using a .onion address.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Form-grabbing and web traffic modification are techniques used to steal credentials.
   - Communication with a C&C server using a .onion address is a method to ensure the communication is encrypted and less likely to be detected by network monitoring tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves compromising a security control to gain unauthorized access. It does not directly relate to the communication method using a .onion address.
   - **B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling:** This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security controls. While it could be used to communicate with a C&C server, it is not specifically about using a .onion address.
   - **C: T1090.002-External Proxy:** This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. While it can be used to obfuscate traffic, it is not specifically about using a .onion address.
   - **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process:** This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or evade detection. It does not directly relate to the communication method using a .onion address.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The most plausible technique for communication with a C&C server using a .onion address is **T1071.003-Uncommon Ports** or a similar technique that involves using a .onion address, which is a form of encrypted communication that is not easily detected by standard network monitoring tools.

Given the options provided, none of them directly mention .onion addresses, but the closest in context to using an encrypted and hidden communication channel is **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**, as it involves encapsulating one protocol within another, which could include using a .onion address.

**Final Answer: B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
