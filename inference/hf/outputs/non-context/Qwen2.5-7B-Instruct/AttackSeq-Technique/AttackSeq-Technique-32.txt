To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Stolen Credentials**: The attacker has obtained stolen credentials.
2. **Tools Used**: The attacker uses tools like ProxyChains for lateral movement.
3. **Downloaded Malware**: The attacker downloads PUPYRAT.
4. **Lateral Movement**: The attacker moves via RDP to a Windows server.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
- This technique involves the use of chat messages to exfiltrate data or deliver malicious content. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, as it does not involve stolen credentials or tools like ProxyChains.

**B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
- This technique involves the use of cloud services to host or exfiltrate data. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, as it does not involve stolen credentials or tools like ProxyChains.

**C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
- This technique involves the use of alternate authentication material, such as stolen credentials, to gain access to a system. This aligns well with the first step in the described sequence, where stolen credentials are used.

**D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
- This technique involves the use of obfuscated files or information to evade detection. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, as it does not involve stolen credentials or tools like ProxyChains.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Stolen Credentials**: The first step in the sequence is the use of stolen credentials, which aligns with T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material.
2. **Tools Used**: The next step involves using tools like ProxyChains for lateral movement, which is not directly covered by any of the provided options.
3. **Downloaded Malware**: The attacker downloads PUPYRAT, which is a malware, but this is not directly related to the initial use of stolen credentials.
4. **Lateral Movement**: The attacker moves via RDP to a Windows server, which is a method of lateral movement but is not directly covered by any of the provided options.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the initial step of using stolen credentials, is best represented by T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material.

**Final Answer: C**
