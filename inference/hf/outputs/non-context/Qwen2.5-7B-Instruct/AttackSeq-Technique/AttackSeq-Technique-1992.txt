To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before SkinnyBoy established C2 communication with updaterweb[.]com by sending exfiltrated data in a structured POST request, let's analyze each option in the context of the described sequence of events.

1. **T1001-Data Obfuscation (A)**: This technique involves encoding or encrypting data to avoid detection. While data obfuscation could be a step in the process, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for establishing C2 communication. It is more likely to be a step that occurs after the data has been exfiltrated.

2. **T1205.002-Socket Filters (B)**: This technique involves modifying network traffic to evade detection. While it could be a step in the process, it is not directly related to the establishment of C2 communication or the sending of data in a structured POST request.

3. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol (C)**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish C2 communication. Since the question mentions that SkinnyBoy established C2 communication with updaterweb[.]com by sending exfiltrated data in a structured POST request, this technique directly aligns with the described sequence of events.

4. **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery (D)**: This technique involves gathering information about the system owner or user to tailor the attack. While this could be a step in the overall attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the establishment of C2 communication or the sending of data in a structured POST request.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that SkinnyBoy first uses an application layer protocol (T1071) to establish C2 communication and then sends exfiltrated data in a structured POST request.

Final Answer: C
