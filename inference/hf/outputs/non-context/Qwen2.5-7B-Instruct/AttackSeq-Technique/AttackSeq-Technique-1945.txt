To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
- **Smooth Operator malware** is mentioned, which is a hypothetical term for a piece of malware.
- The malware collected OS version, hostname, and C2 index for inclusion in beacons.
- We need to identify the next likely TTP after this data collection.

### Answer Choices:
A. **T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves using Visual Basic for scripting or automation. It does not directly relate to the data collection or exfiltration process described.

B. **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not the primary or expected one. Given that the malware has collected data (OS version, hostname, and C2 index), the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data.

C. **T1011.001-Exfiltration Over Bluetooth**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over Bluetooth. While this is a form of exfiltration, it is less likely than using an alternative protocol, especially if the primary C2 channel is not over Bluetooth.

D. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts on the system to avoid detection. While this is a common TTP, it is more likely to occur after the data has been collected and exfiltrated, rather than immediately after the data collection.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Data Collection**: The malware has collected OS version, hostname, and C2 index.
2. **Next Step**: The most logical next step would be to exfiltrate this data to the C2 server.
3. **Exfiltration Method**: Exfiltrating data over an alternative protocol (T1048) is a common method to avoid detection and ensure data is not exfiltrated over the primary network channel.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs after the data collection is the exfiltration of the collected data over an alternative protocol.

**Final Answer: B**
