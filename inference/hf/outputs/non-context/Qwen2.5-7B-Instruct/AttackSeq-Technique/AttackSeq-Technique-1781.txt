Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is: gathering system data and running processes, capturing data from removable media, and then communicating with the C2 server to upload encrypted data.
   - We need to identify which technique involves capturing data specifically from removable media as part of its collection activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1125-Video Capture** - This technique involves capturing video data, which is not related to capturing data from removable media.
   - **B: T1025-Data from Removable Media** - This technique directly involves collecting data from removable media, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - **C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance** - This technique involves running a virtual instance to evade detection, which is not related to capturing data from removable media.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, which is not related to capturing data from removable media.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the technique should involve capturing data from removable media as part of its collection activities.
   - Among the given options, only T1025-Data from Removable Media directly matches this requirement.

**Final Answer: B**
