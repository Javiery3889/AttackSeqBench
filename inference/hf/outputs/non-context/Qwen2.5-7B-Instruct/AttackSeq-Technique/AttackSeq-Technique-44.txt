Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two TTPs:
     - KONNI malware executing arbitrary code on the infected host.
     - Stolen screenshots being uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**
     - This technique involves archiving data using a custom method. It does not directly relate to the execution of arbitrary code or the uploading of stolen screenshots.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots. This aligns with the stolen screenshots being taken, which would logically occur after the execution of arbitrary code.
   - **C: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**
     - This technique involves monitoring user activity. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the execution of arbitrary code or the uploading of stolen screenshots.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring malware runs at boot or logon. This would typically occur before the execution of arbitrary code, not after.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The execution of arbitrary code would likely occur after the malware has been installed and before any screenshots are taken.
   - The stolen screenshots would then be captured and uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware executes arbitrary code, then captures stolen screenshots (T1113-Screen Capture), and finally uploads them to the C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture**
