Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs leading to the exfiltration of data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.
   - The adversary has already completed the discovery phase, which includes collecting file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The discovery phase (which includes collecting file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes) is a preparatory step.
   - The next step would be to access and copy the data from the discovered locations.
   - The final step is exfiltrating the data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1114-Email Collection**
     - This technique involves collecting email content, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
     - This technique involves modifying shared content to include malicious code. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
     - This technique involves accessing and copying data from a network shared drive. This aligns well with the described sequence, as the adversary has discovered remote system shares and would need to access and copy data from these shares.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to the network. While this could be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly align with the described sequence of TTPs after the discovery phase.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the described attack sequence, is the access and copying of data from the discovered remote system shares, which aligns with T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive.

Final Answer: C
