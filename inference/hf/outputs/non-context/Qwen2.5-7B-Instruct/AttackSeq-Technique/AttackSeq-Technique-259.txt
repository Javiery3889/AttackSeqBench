Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two key TTPs:
     - Persistence via the creation of a service and a registry Run key.
     - Padding ShadowPad samples to over 50MB and deleting the third file in three-file execution chains to remove traces of malicious activity.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly relate to the persistence or cleanup actions mentioned.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to avoid detection. The deletion of the third file in the execution chain and padding the ShadowPad samples to remove traces of malicious activity aligns well with hiding artifacts.
   - **C: T1098.003-Additional Cloud Roles**
     - This technique involves using additional cloud roles to gain access. It does not relate to the persistence or cleanup actions mentioned.
   - **D: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**
     - This technique involves using time-based evasion to avoid detection. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly relate to the persistence or cleanup actions mentioned.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described actions (persistence and cleanup) is T1564-Hide Artifacts. This technique directly addresses the actions of hiding and obfuscating the malicious activities.

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
