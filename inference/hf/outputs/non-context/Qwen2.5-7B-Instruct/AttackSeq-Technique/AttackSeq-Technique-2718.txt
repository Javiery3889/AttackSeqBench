To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the IEXPL0RE RAT communicated with the C2 server using HTTP POST and GET methods with encrypted communication, let's analyze each option in the context of the given sequence of TTPs.

1. **T1053.005-Scheduled Task (A)**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a malicious payload. While this could be a precursor to the RAT's communication, it is more of a persistence mechanism rather than a direct precursor to the communication itself.

2. **T1564-Hide Artifacts (B)**: This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts on the system. While hiding the RAT's presence is important, it is not directly related to the communication method (HTTP POST and GET with encryption).

3. **T1071.004-DNS (C)**: This technique involves using DNS for command and control (C2) communication. However, the question specifies that the communication is via HTTP POST and GET methods, not DNS. Therefore, this is not the most likely technique.

4. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol (D)**: This technique involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication. Given that the communication is via HTTP POST and GET methods, this is the most relevant technique. Before using these methods, the attacker would need to establish the protocol and possibly configure it for encrypted communication.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question specifies that the RAT communicates with the C2 server using HTTP POST and GET methods with encrypted communication.
2. T1071-Application Layer Protocol (D) directly relates to the use of application layer protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the HTTP POST and GET methods.
3. The other techniques (Scheduled Task, Hide Artifacts, and DNS) are either not directly related to the communication method or are more about the aftermath or setup rather than the communication itself.

**Final Answer: D**
