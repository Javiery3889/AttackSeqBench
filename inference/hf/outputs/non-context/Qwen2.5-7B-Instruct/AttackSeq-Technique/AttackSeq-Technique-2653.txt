Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Dridex malware uses obfuscation and anti-debug techniques to evade detection.
   - The malware then communicates with its Command and Control (C2) servers using encrypted POST requests to send data such as the computer name and botnet ID number.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control communications. Since the malware is using encrypted POST requests, this aligns well with the use of an application layer protocol for communication.
   - **B: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
     - This technique is about evading debugging tools, which is already mentioned in the question. It does not pertain to the communication aspect.
   - **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to evade detection. While this could be part of the obfuscation, it does not directly address the communication aspect.
   - **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
     - This technique is about determining the physical location of the target. It does not align with the communication of data to C2 servers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the communication aspect of the malware, specifically using encrypted POST requests to send data.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol directly addresses the use of application layer protocols for C2 communications, which fits the scenario described.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
