Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     1. Execution of a malicious XLS macro.
     2. Silent download and installation of the SunSeed malware.
     3. Establishing a connection to the actor-controlled staging server.
   - The final step in the sequence is ensuring that the SunSeed malware automatically runs at Windows Startup.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. It is not directly related to ensuring malware runs at startup.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves adding malware to the Windows registry or other startup locations to ensure it runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns well with the requirement to ensure the malware runs at Windows Startup.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. It does not directly relate to ensuring malware runs at startup.
   - **D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the system's search order to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. While it can be used to execute malware, it is not specifically about ensuring malware runs at startup.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is specifically about ensuring the malware runs at Windows Startup. Among the given options, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (B) is the most relevant and directly addresses this requirement.
   - The other options either do not pertain to the startup execution or are more about the initial execution or injection of the malware rather than ensuring it runs at startup.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
