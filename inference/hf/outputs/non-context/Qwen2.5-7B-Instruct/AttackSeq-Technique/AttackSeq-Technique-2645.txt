Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: staging data in a temporary folder, encrypting it, and then transmitting it to C&C servers.
   - The focus is on the transmission step, which involves exfiltrating the encrypted data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network configuration information. It does not align with the exfiltration of data.
   - **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is symmetrically encrypted and not a C2 channel. While it involves encryption, it does not specifically mention C2 channels.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a channel that is used for command and control communications. This aligns well with the scenario of transmitting data to C&C servers.
   - **D: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning networks or systems to identify vulnerabilities or gather information. It does not align with the exfiltration of data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the data is transmitted to C&C servers, which implies a specific communication channel used for command and control.
   - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel directly matches this scenario as it involves exfiltrating data over a channel used for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
