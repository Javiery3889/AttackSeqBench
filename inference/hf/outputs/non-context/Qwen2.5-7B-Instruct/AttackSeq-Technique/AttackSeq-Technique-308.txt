Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a RAT (Remote Access Tool) is used to leverage Defense Evasion techniques by mimicking SSL traffic and encoding C&C (Command and Control) data.
   - The next step in the sequence is to enable communication with the C&C server using HTTP POST requests with encoded data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols for command and control. However, it does not specifically mention HTTP POST requests or encoding.
   - **B: T1590.006-Network Security Appliances**
     - This technique is about evading detection by network security appliances. It does not directly relate to the communication method being used.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. HTTP is an application layer protocol, and POST requests are a part of HTTP. This aligns well with the description of using HTTP POST requests.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. It does not directly relate to the communication method being used.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies the use of HTTP POST requests, which are a part of the HTTP protocol.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol (C) is the most relevant technique as it encompasses the use of application layer protocols, including HTTP.
   - The other techniques do not directly address the use of HTTP POST requests for C&C communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
