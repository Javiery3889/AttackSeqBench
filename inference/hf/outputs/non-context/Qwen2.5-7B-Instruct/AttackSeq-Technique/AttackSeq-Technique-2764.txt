To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Listener Configuration within Cobalt Strike**: This step involves setting up a listener to enable communication with the C2 server. This is a preparatory step for establishing a connection.

2. **Communication with C2 Server**: After the listener is configured, the next step would be to establish communication with the C2 server. This is a critical step to ensure the listener is operational and can receive further instructions.

3. **Reflective DLL Injection to Load Beacon.dll**: This is the final step where the attacker uses reflective DLL injection to load the beacon.dll, which is a key component of Cobalt Strike for maintaining persistence and control over the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of steps described (listener configuration, communication with C2 server, and reflective DLL injection).

B. **T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique involves using container orchestration to run malicious code. This is not directly related to the sequence of steps described, as it pertains to a different method of execution and is not a common TTP in the context of Cobalt Strike.

C. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. While this could be a step in the overall attack, it is not the immediate step after listener configuration and before reflective DLL injection.

D. **T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves using keylogging to capture keystrokes. While keylogging could be a post-exploitation activity, it is not the immediate step after listener configuration and before reflective DLL injection.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible step that occurs after listener configuration and before reflective DLL injection is establishing communication with the C2 server. This aligns with the T1071-Application Layer Protocol technique, as it involves the use of application layer protocols to establish and maintain communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
