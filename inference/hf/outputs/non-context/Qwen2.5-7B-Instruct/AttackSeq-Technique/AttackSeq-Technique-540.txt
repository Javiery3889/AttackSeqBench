Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - PIVY establishes persistence via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.
   - It uses DLL sideloading.
   - It modifies malware configuration.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1200-Hardware Additions** - This technique involves adding hardware to a system to evade detection. It does not align with the described TTPs.
   - **B: T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting** - This technique involves misleading security systems or users to avoid detection. While it could be relevant, it does not directly address the use of DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique involves hiding or obfuscating the presence of malicious artifacts on the system. DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration are both methods to hide or alter the behavior of malware, which aligns well with hiding artifacts.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not align with the described TTPs.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes techniques that are directly related to hiding and modifying malware behavior, which is best captured by the "Hide Artifacts" technique.
   - DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration are both methods to hide and alter the behavior of malware, which is the core of the "Hide Artifacts" technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
