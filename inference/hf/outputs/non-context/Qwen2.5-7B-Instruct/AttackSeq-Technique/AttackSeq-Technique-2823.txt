Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The scenario describes an initial access technique where Hacking Team's spyware gained entry by disguising an executable file as a PDF document and delivering it via a spearphishing email.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial access technique described is T1566-Phishing, as it involves the use of a spearphishing email to deliver the spyware.
   - After gaining initial access, the next step would be to establish a foothold and maintain access, which typically involves more sophisticated techniques.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading** - This technique involves disguising malicious files or processes to evade detection. While it could be a step after initial access, it is more of a persistence technique rather than a direct follow-up to gaining access.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing** - This is the initial access technique mentioned in the question, so it cannot be the next step.
   - **C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing** - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious code. It is a common technique used to maintain persistence and evade detection, which would logically follow initial access.
   - **D: T1647-Plist File Modification** - This technique involves modifying macOS plist files to execute malicious code. While it is a persistence technique, it is more specific to macOS and may not be the most general or likely follow-up to the described scenario.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is via T1566-Phishing.
   - After gaining access, the next step would likely be to establish a more persistent foothold.
   - T1055.012-Process Hollowing is a common technique for maintaining persistence and evading detection, which fits well as a follow-up to initial access.

**Final Answer: C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
