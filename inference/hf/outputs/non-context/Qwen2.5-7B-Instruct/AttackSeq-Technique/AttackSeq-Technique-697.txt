To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that cybercriminals downloaded remote administration tools during the execution phase.
   - The next phase of interest is the discovery phase, where the cybercriminals explored the financial systems of the targeted organization.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1201-Password Policy Discovery** - This technique involves discovering password policies, which is more relevant to the credential access phase rather than the discovery phase.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts** - This technique is about hiding artifacts to avoid detection, which is more relevant to the persistence or defense evasion phases rather than the discovery phase.
   - **C: T1027.008-Stripped Payloads** - This technique involves modifying payloads to avoid detection, which is also more relevant to the execution or defense evasion phases.
   - **D: T1087-Account Discovery** - This technique involves identifying and enumerating accounts, which is directly related to the discovery phase as the cybercriminals are exploring the financial systems to find relevant accounts.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the cybercriminals are in the discovery phase.
   - The goal is to find relevant accounts within the financial systems.
   - T1087-Account Discovery fits this scenario perfectly as it involves identifying and enumerating accounts, which is a common activity during the discovery phase to understand the target's environment.

**Final Answer: D: T1087-Account Discovery**
