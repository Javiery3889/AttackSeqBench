Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The scenario describes an attack sequence during Operation NightScout.
   - The attack starts with a supply chain attack on BigNox's update mechanism.
   - The next step is to evade detection before extracting C&C information to a file on the victim's system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The supply chain attack is already mentioned (T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice).
   - The next step is to evade detection before extracting C&C information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system to ensure it is in a state that allows the attacker to proceed with their actions. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address evading detection.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts on the system to evade detection. This aligns well with the need to evade detection before extracting C&C information.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique is already mentioned in the question as the initial access method. It does not fit the need to evade detection after initial access.
   - **D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique is already mentioned as the initial access method. It does not fit the need to evade detection after initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the need to evade detection before extracting C&C information is T1564-Hide Artifacts.

Final Answer: B
