Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with a spear-phishing attack using exploits for known vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
   - The attackers then establish a sophisticated C&C infrastructure with proxy servers and over 60 domain names.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique was most likely employed to infect remote hosts during lateral movement in the local area network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data** - This technique involves purchasing technical data, which is not directly related to the exploitation of vulnerabilities or lateral movement.
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system. This aligns with the initial access via spear-phishing and exploits for known vulnerabilities.
   - **C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket** - This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to gain access to resources without needing to authenticate. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities.
   - **D: T1078-Valid Accounts** - This technique involves using valid user accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is gained through a spear-phishing attack with exploits for known vulnerabilities, which aligns with T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
   - The question asks about the technique used for lateral movement in the local area network, which is a different phase of the attack.
   - T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is the most relevant technique for the initial exploitation phase, and it can be used to infect remote hosts during lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
