To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Exploitation of a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841)**: This is the initial step where the attacker gains access to the system.

2. **Execution of Tuyul malware**: After gaining access, the malware is executed.

3. **Execution of Perl scripts and shell commands**: The malware then uses these scripts and commands to operate on the victim system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While this is a step that occurs after the malware is executed, it is not the initial step in the sequence.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to communicate with the attacker. This is not directly related to the initial exploitation or the execution of the malware.

- **C: T1587.004-Exploits**: This technique specifically refers to the exploitation of software vulnerabilities. This aligns with the initial step of the attack sequence, where the attacker exploits a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems.

- **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This technique involves the use of systemd timers to schedule tasks. While this could be a step in the malware's operation, it is not the initial step in the sequence.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible initial step is the exploitation of the vulnerability, which is best represented by the T1587.004-Exploits technique.

**Final Answer: C**
