Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the threat actors gained initial access through a compromised software update using the Supply Chain Compromise technique. This is a valid starting point for the attack sequence.

2. **Executing Code Using System Services**: The next step in the sequence is that the threat actors executed code using system services. This implies that the threat actors are leveraging the system's services to run their malicious code, which is a common tactic to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating processes to find information about the system. While this could be a step in the attack, it does not directly relate to executing code using system services.
   - **B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence**: This technique involves creating or modifying system startup entries to ensure the malware persists across reboots. While this is a form of persistence, it does not directly involve executing code using system services.
   - **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: These are scripting languages that can be used to automate tasks. While they can be used to execute code, they do not specifically relate to using system services.
   - **D: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to execute code. This directly aligns with the question's description of executing code using system services.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly involves using system services to execute code, which is best represented by T1569-System Services.

Final Answer: D
