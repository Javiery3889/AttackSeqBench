To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The Duke group gained initial access to high-profile government networks using 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails. This indicates the use of social engineering techniques to gain initial access.

2. **Credential Access**: The next step mentioned is the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks to gain further access, which implies that the attackers have already obtained or are in the process of obtaining credentials.

Given this sequence, we need to find a TTP that logically follows initial access and precedes the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.

- **A: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves an adversary impersonating a legitimate user or system. While it could be used after gaining initial access, it doesn't directly relate to the credential access step involving Kerberos.

- **B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service. This is more likely to occur after the attackers have gained access and obtained valuable data, rather than before leveraging Kerberos for credential access.

- **C: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**: This technique involves using the AppDomainManager to execute code in a .NET application domain. This is a method to run malicious code and could be used to establish persistence or further access, but it doesn't directly relate to the credential access step.

- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This could be used to cover tracks after gaining initial access and before leveraging Kerberos for credential access, as it helps in maintaining persistence and avoiding detection.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible step that occurs after gaining initial access and before leveraging Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks is hiding artifacts to maintain stealth and persistence.

Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
