To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the wiper module employed RawDisk to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system under the Impact tactic, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection or to protect the data. It does not directly relate to the process of overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files, which is the primary action of the wiper module. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the technique that occurred before the wiper module's action.

2. **T1561-Disk Wipe**: This technique involves wiping data from a disk, which aligns closely with the action of overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files. However, T1561 is more about the act of wiping data, which is what the wiper module is doing. It is less likely to be the technique that occurred before the wiper module's action, as it is the action itself.

3. **T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache to redirect network traffic. It is a method of gaining network access or control, but it does not directly relate to the process of overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the technique that occurred before the wiper module's action.

4. **T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood**: This technique involves flooding a service with requests to exhaust its resources. It is a method of denial of service (DoS) and does not directly relate to the process of overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the technique that occurred before the wiper module's action.

Given the analysis, none of the provided techniques directly precede the wiper module's action of overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files. However, if we consider the context of the Impact tactic and the need to prepare the system for the wiper module's action, the most plausible technique would be one that could be used to gain control or access to the system before the wiper module is deployed. Among the given options, T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning is the closest to a preparatory step that could be used to gain network control, which might be necessary before deploying a wiper module.

Final Answer: C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning
