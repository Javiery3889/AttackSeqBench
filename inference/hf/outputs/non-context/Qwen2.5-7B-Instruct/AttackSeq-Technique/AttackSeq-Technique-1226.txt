Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a two-stage spear phishing process, which is a social engineering technique used to gather information and deliver a payload.
   - The question then asks about a technique that occurred before the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882, which is a specific vulnerability used to gain initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is:
     1. Two-stage spear phishing (social engineering).
     2. Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 (technical exploit).

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**
     - This technique involves using a list of words to guess passwords or other credentials. It is not directly related to the spear phishing process or the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882.
   - **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
     - This technique involves using network traffic to signal to the attacker that a target is online or available. It is not directly related to the spear phishing process or the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from the system. It is not directly related to the spear phishing process or the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882.
   - **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is a crucial step in a spear phishing campaign. It aligns with the first stage of the described attack sequence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first gathered victim identity information (T1589) through the two-stage spear phishing process, and then used CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access.

**Final Answer: D**
