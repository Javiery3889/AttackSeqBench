Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Grabit malware sends an HTTP request to a compromised remote server for downloading itself via a malicious macro.
   - The next step in the sequence is to maintain persistence on the infected system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware has already downloaded itself via an HTTP request.
   - The next step is to ensure that the malware remains on the system even after a reboot or system restart.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels** - This technique involves using alternative methods to communicate with the attacker if the primary method is detected or blocked. This does not directly relate to maintaining persistence.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves ensuring that the malware runs when the system boots up or when a user logs in. This is a common method to maintain persistence.
   - **C: T1546.011-Application Shimming** - This technique involves modifying the behavior of legitimate applications to execute malicious code. This is not directly related to maintaining persistence.
   - **D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association** - This technique involves changing the default file association to execute malicious code when a specific file type is opened. This is also not directly related to maintaining persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already downloaded itself via an HTTP request.
   - To maintain persistence, the malware needs to ensure it runs every time the system boots up or a user logs in.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (B) is the most relevant technique for ensuring the malware runs at system boot or user login.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
