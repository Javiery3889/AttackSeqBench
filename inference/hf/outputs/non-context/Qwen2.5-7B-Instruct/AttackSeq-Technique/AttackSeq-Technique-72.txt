Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Adwind RAT is using multi-layer obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
   - The RAT is then attempting to connect to its command and control (C2) server.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique enabled the capture of webcam images as part of the RAT's core functionality.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves the use of a C2 channel to exfiltrate data. While it is related to the C2 channel, it does not specifically mention the capture of webcam images.
   - **B: T1125-Video Capture:** This technique directly involves capturing video or images from a webcam, which aligns with the question's requirement to capture webcam images.
   - **C: T1608.002-Upload Tool:** This technique involves uploading a tool to a remote system. It does not specifically mention the capture of webcam images.
   - **D: T1213.002-Sharepoint:** This technique involves using Microsoft SharePoint for data exfiltration or data storage. It does not pertain to the capture of webcam images.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the RAT is capturing webcam images, which is a specific action.
   - T1125-Video Capture is the only technique that directly mentions the capture of video or images from a webcam, making it the most relevant to the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1125-Video Capture**
