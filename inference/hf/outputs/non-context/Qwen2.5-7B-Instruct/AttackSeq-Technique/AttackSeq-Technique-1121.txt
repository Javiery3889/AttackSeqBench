Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that LYCEUM gained additional access from credentials gathered via Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1.
   - After gaining this access, the next step was to target HR and IT personnel with spearphishing emails to acquire information for further operational planning.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating accounts and their associated information. While it could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly follow the credential gathering via Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 and precede the spearphishing.
   - **B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique is about evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. It doesn't fit the sequence as it is more about avoiding detection rather than the next step after gaining access.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to maintain access or control. While it could be a step in maintaining access, it doesn't directly follow the credential gathering and precede the spearphishing.
   - **D: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**
     - This technique involves using vulnerabilities to gain access to systems or networks. However, the question already states that LYCEUM gained access via credentials, so this is not the next step.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence would be to use the credentials gained to further explore and exploit the network, which aligns with the next step in the attack sequence.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to use the credentials to further explore and exploit the network, which is best represented by T1087-Account Discovery.

**Final Answer: A: T1087-Account Discovery**
