Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Dridex initially gains access through spambots delivering malicious documents with embedded macros.
   - The next step in the sequence is the download of the malware payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Spambots delivering malicious documents with embedded macros.
   - The next step is the download of the malware payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions on the system. It is not directly related to the download of a payload.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. It is more about hiding the payload rather than downloading it.
   - **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using software deployment tools to install or deploy malware. This is more relevant to the download and installation of the payload.
   - **D: T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling**
     - This sub-technique involves using LNK files to smuggle malicious content. It is more about delivery rather than the download of the payload.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the initial access and the subsequent download of the malware payload.
   - Among the given options, T1072-Software Deployment Tools (C) is the most relevant to the download and installation of the malware payload.

**Final Answer: C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
