To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Initial TTPs:**
   - CosmicDuke utilized a keylogger and a screenshotter for gathering user activity information. This indicates that the adversary is collecting sensitive data and visual information from the victim's system.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from the victim's system to a remote location. While it is a logical step after data collection, it does not directly follow the use of a keylogger and screenshotter.
   - **B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
     - This technique involves the use of a network provider DLL to establish a covert channel for data exfiltration. It is a specific method for data exfiltration but does not directly follow the use of a keylogger and screenshotter.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves the compression or archiving of collected data before exfiltration. It is a logical step after data collection to prepare the data for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1115-Clipboard Data**
     - This technique involves the use of clipboard data to exfiltrate information. While it is a method for data exfiltration, it does not directly follow the use of a keylogger and screenshotter.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - After using a keylogger and a screenshotter to gather user activity information, the next logical step would be to archive or compress this data to make it more manageable and secure for exfiltration.
   - T1560-Archive Collected Data fits this scenario as it directly addresses the need to organize and prepare the collected data for the next phase of the attack, which is likely exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
