Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves a backdoor ('IPsec Helper') communicating with C2 servers to receive commands and exfiltrate information.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to destroy data on targeted systems after these actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms** - This technique is about generating domains for C2 communications, which is not related to destroying data.
   - **B: T1485-Data Destruction** - This technique directly involves the destruction of data on the targeted systems, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - **C: T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation** - This technique involves exploiting applications or systems, which is not specifically about destroying data.
   - **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process** - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not related to destroying data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor ('IPsec Helper') is used to communicate with C2 servers and exfiltrate data.
   - The question asks what technique was used to destroy data on the targeted systems after these actions.
   - T1485-Data Destruction is the only technique that directly involves the destruction of data, which fits the scenario described.

**Final Answer: B: T1485-Data Destruction**
