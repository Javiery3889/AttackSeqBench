Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attacker gained command and control through HTTP POST communication or encrypted communications with compromised legitimate websites.
   - The attacker then used a `net use` command after receiving positive ping responses to move between systems.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking an SSH session. The question mentions HTTP POST communication and encrypted communications, which are not directly related to SSH hijacking.
   - **B: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves the use of remote services to establish a foothold on a system. The `net use` command is often used to map network drives, which is a form of remote service usage. This aligns well with the context of moving between systems.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves the use of native APIs to perform actions on a system. While `net use` can be considered a native API call, the context of moving between systems using ping responses is more aligned with remote service usage.
   - **D: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
     - This technique involves creating a hidden file system to store data. The `net use` command and moving between systems do not directly relate to hidden file systems.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is best described by the use of remote services to move between systems, which aligns with the `net use` command and the context of positive ping responses.

**Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services**
