Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that APT10 extracted data from Dropbox using cURL for Windows.
   - Before this, proprietary data was compressed using WinRAR.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, which could include cloud storage. However, it does not specifically address the compression of data or the use of cURL for Windows.
   - **B: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to perform actions on a system. While it could be relevant to the overall attack, it does not directly address the compression of data or the use of cURL for Windows.
   - **C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**
     - This technique involves accessing data stored in the cloud. Given that the data was extracted from Dropbox, which is a cloud storage service, this technique is highly relevant.
   - **D: T1614.001-System Language Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the system language to tailor the attack. It does not relate to the compression of data or the extraction of data from Dropbox.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves compressing data using WinRAR and then extracting it from Dropbox.
   - T1530-Data from Cloud Storage (Choice C) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the extraction of data from a cloud storage service, which is Dropbox in this case.

**Final Answer: C**
