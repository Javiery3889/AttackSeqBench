Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two key TTPs:
     - **ChromeLoader installed a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic.**
     - **Operation In(ter)ception's malware served as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2.**

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547.014-Active Setup**
     - This technique involves the use of Active Setup to execute malicious code. It doesn't directly relate to intercepting browser traffic or acting as a downloader.
   - **B: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic through a third-party server. While it could be used to intercept traffic, it doesn't directly describe the action of installing a listener or serving as a downloader.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a legitimate software supply chain to deliver malicious code. It doesn't directly describe the action of intercepting traffic or acting as a downloader.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools from a C2 server to a victim's system. It aligns well with the action of serving as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question asks for the TTP that occurred after ChromeLoader installed a listener and before the malware served as a downloader. The most plausible sequence would be:
     - **ChromeLoader installs a listener (T1134.001 - Traffic Intercept).**
     - **The malware then acts as a downloader (T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer).**

Given the options, **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** is the most relevant technique for the action of serving as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2.

**Final Answer: D**
