To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that after executing the malicious file `System.doc`, a Defense Evasion technique was detected by FireEye's ExploitGuard, which identified anomalous behaviors in Microsoft Excel.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which could be relevant if the attacker was trying to capture data from the user. However, it doesn't directly explain the detection of anomalous behavior in Microsoft Excel.
   - **B: T1491-Defacement**: This technique involves modifying or destroying content on a website or web application. It doesn't align with the context of executing a file and detecting behavior in Microsoft Excel.
   - **C: T1098-Account Manipulation**: This technique involves modifying user accounts or privileges. While it could be part of a broader attack, it doesn't directly explain the detection of anomalous behavior in Microsoft Excel.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run at a later time. If a malicious file like `System.doc` was executed, it could be part of a larger attack where a scheduled task was created to run the file at a later time, which could then lead to the detection of anomalous behavior in Microsoft Excel.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The execution of `System.doc` suggests that the initial payload was delivered and executed.
   - The detection of anomalous behavior in Microsoft Excel by FireEye's ExploitGuard implies that the payload or a subsequent action caused a deviation from normal behavior.
   - Among the given options, creating a scheduled task (T1053) could be a plausible step that would lead to the execution of the payload at a later time, which could then cause the detection of anomalous behavior in Microsoft Excel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   Final Answer: D
