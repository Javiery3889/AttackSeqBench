Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
     - Compromising websites through watering hole tactics.
     - Injecting exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
     - Executing custom shellcode.
     - De-obfuscating strings.
     - Initializing a network connection.
     - Downloading the payload 'dropper.dll'.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications. While it fits the initial part of the sequence (injecting exploits), it does not cover the subsequent steps of executing shellcode, de-obfuscating strings, initializing a network connection, and downloading a payload.
   - **B: T1651-Cloud Administration Command**
     - This technique involves using cloud services for command and control. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, as it does not cover the execution of shellcode, de-obfuscation, or downloading a payload.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities to execute code on the client machine. It aligns well with the described sequence, as it covers the execution of custom shellcode and de-obfuscation. However, it does not explicitly cover the network connection and payload download.
   - **D: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**
     - This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to perform lateral movement and privilege escalation. It does not align with the described sequence, as it does not cover the execution of shellcode, de-obfuscation, or downloading a payload.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best covered by **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**. While it does not explicitly cover the network connection and payload download, it is the closest match to the described sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
