Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is:
     1. Executing a VBA macro using 'mshta.exe'.
     2. Downloading a dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL.
     3. Ensuring continuous execution of malicious code every two hours.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1565-Data Manipulation:** This technique involves altering data to achieve a malicious purpose. It does not align with the requirement of ensuring continuous execution of code.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. It does not fit the context of ensuring continuous execution of code.
   - **C: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL:** This technique involves using a Terminal Services Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to load a DLL. It is not directly related to ensuring the continuous execution of code.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job:** This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run at a specific time or interval. This aligns with the requirement of ensuring the malicious code runs every two hours.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the malware needs to ensure its code runs continuously every two hours. This requirement is best met by creating a scheduled task or job.
   - T1053-Scheduled Task/Job (Answer Choice D) is the most appropriate technique for this purpose as it directly addresses the need to run code at specific intervals.

**Final Answer: D**
