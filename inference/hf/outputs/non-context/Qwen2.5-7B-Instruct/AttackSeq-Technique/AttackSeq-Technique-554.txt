Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used Meterpreter and Mimikatz, which are tools for post-exploitation and privilege escalation.
   - They evaded defenses, indicating they used techniques to maintain persistence and stealth.
   - The question mentions facilitating communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling** - This technique involves using domain generation algorithms (DGAs) or other methods to create a large number of domain names for C2 (Command and Control) communications. This aligns with the use of domains and proxy URLs for communication.
   - **B: T1564.005-Hidden File System** - This technique involves hiding files or directories on a system to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to communication methods.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. While it could be used in conjunction with other techniques, it does not specifically mention the use of domains and proxy URLs.
   - **D: T1548.004-Elevated Execution with Prompt** - This technique involves gaining elevated privileges on a system, which is more about privilege escalation rather than communication methods.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers used Meterpreter and Mimikatz, which are tools for post-exploitation and privilege escalation.
   - They evaded defenses, which suggests they used techniques to maintain stealth and persistence.
   - The use of domains and proxy URLs for communication aligns with the use of domain generation algorithms (DGAs) or similar methods to create a large number of domain names for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
