To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Attack Sequence Analysis:**
   - The attackers used `chroot` to run processes outside the container, which is a technique to limit the access of a process to a specific directory.
   - The purpose of this was to avoid detection when removing security software like Alibaba Aliyun Aegis cloud security software.

2. **Evaluating Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1136-Create Account** - This technique involves creating new user accounts or modifying existing ones. While this could be part of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the use of `chroot` or the removal of security software.
   - **B: T1557-Adversary-in-the-Middle** - This technique involves inserting an adversary-controlled entity into a communication path. It doesn't align with the described sequence of using `chroot` and removing security software.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to make them less detectable. While this could be a step after removing security software, it doesn't directly address the use of `chroot`.
   - **D: T1055.014-VDSO Hijacking** - This technique involves hijacking the Virtual Dynamic Shared Object (VDSO) to perform operations that would normally require a system call but are done in user space. This technique is more about bypassing certain security mechanisms and could be used to avoid detection after removing security software.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers used `chroot` to run processes outside the container, which is a technique to avoid detection.
   - They then removed Alibaba Aliyun Aegis cloud security software to further avoid detection.
   - The next logical step would be to perform an operation that would bypass or avoid detection by other means, such as VDSO hijacking.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is the use of VDSO hijacking to further avoid detection.

Final Answer: D
