Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used legitimate commands and tools to evade detection and maintain backdoor connections.
   - They specifically used `plink.exe` for RDP access over SSH.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers are using legitimate tools to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - `plink.exe` is a command-line tool for SSH connections, often used to establish secure shell connections.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance**
     - This technique involves running a virtual machine or container to hide malicious activity.
     - It does not directly relate to using legitimate tools for RDP access over SSH.
   - **B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
     - This technique involves executing commands through an intermediary, which can help evade detection.
     - It aligns with the use of legitimate tools to maintain backdoor connections.
   - **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves deploying software to systems, which is not directly related to the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access.
   - **D: T1137.006-Add-ins**
     - This technique involves adding or modifying add-ins to software to maintain persistence.
     - It does not directly relate to the use of `plink.exe` for RDP access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers are using `plink.exe` to establish RDP access over SSH, which is a method to maintain backdoor connections.
   - The use of `plink.exe` is a form of indirect command execution, as it is a legitimate tool being used to execute commands (SSH connections) in a way that helps evade detection.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is B: T1202-Indirect Command Execution.

Final Answer: B
