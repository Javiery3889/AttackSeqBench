To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Bypassing Blocking of Active C&C Servers**: This suggests the attackers are using a method to communicate with command and control (C&C) servers that are being blocked by security measures. Telegram channels are mentioned as a method to bypass this blocking.

2. **Executing Malicious Stealers**: This indicates that the attackers are using malware to steal system and sensitive data.

3. **Obscuring Communication and Maintaining Access Undetected**: This is the key part of the question, where we need to identify a technique that would help in hiding the communication and maintaining persistence.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to exfiltrate data. While it can help in data exfiltration, it does not directly address the need to obscure communication and maintain access undetected.

B. **T1021.007-Cloud Services**: This technique involves using cloud services to exfiltrate data. Similar to T1102, it focuses on data exfiltration rather than obscuring communication and maintaining access.

C. **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**: This technique involves using a stolen ticket to gain access to network resources. It is more about maintaining access and lateral movement within a network, which aligns with the need to maintain access undetected. However, it does not directly address the need to obscure communication.

D. **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using traffic signaling to control the timing and frequency of network traffic to avoid detection. This directly addresses the need to obscure communication and maintain access undetected by controlling when and how data is transmitted, making it the most relevant technique for the described scenario.

**Final Answer: D: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
