Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an Explosive Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during runtime.
   - The Trojan needs to maintain its presence across reboots, which implies persistence.
   - The persistence is achieved by placing the Trojan in paths such as `%systemroot%\system32` or `%programfiles%`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. However, the question specifically mentions dynamically loading a DLL, which is more related to module loading rather than creating a new process.
   - **B: T1110-Brute Force**
     - This technique involves using automated tools to try multiple passwords or other credentials. It does not align with the described scenario of dynamically loading a DLL.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to maintain persistence. This aligns well with the scenario of dynamically loading a DLL, as the DLL is a shared module that can be loaded into processes.
   - **D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**
     - This technique involves using the .NET AppDomainManager to maintain persistence. While it is related to .NET applications, the question does not specify that the Trojan is a .NET application, and the focus is on the DLL loading mechanism.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Trojan dynamically loads a DLL during runtime to maintain its presence across reboots.
   - The persistence mechanism involves placing the DLL in system directories like `%systemroot%\system32` or `%programfiles%`.
   - Among the given options, T1129-Shared Modules (C) is the most relevant because it directly involves the use of shared modules (DLLs) to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
