To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice.

1. **Bisonal malware evaded defenses using an RC4 cipher with the key "78563412" for encrypting its C2 address strings.**
   - This indicates that the malware uses encryption to obfuscate its communication with the command and control (C2) server.

2. **Hardcoded values for the initial HTTP POST connection.**
   - This suggests that the malware uses a specific HTTP POST method to establish an initial connection to the C2 server.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
   - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. While it is relevant, it does not directly address the encryption or the specific HTTP POST method.

B. **T1566-Phishing**
   - This technique involves the use of social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not align with the technical details provided about encryption and HTTP POST.

C. **T1021.004-SSH**
   - This technique involves the use of SSH (Secure Shell) for remote management. It does not align with the use of HTTP POST for the initial connection.

D. **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
   - This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass security controls. Given that the malware uses an RC4 cipher to encrypt its C2 address strings, it is plausible that the malware uses protocol tunneling to obfuscate its communication, making it appear as a legitimate protocol (like HTTP) to evade detection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The malware uses RC4 encryption, which is a form of protocol tunneling to obfuscate its C2 communication.
2. The initial connection is made using HTTP POST, which is a common method for data transmission.
3. The use of HTTP POST and encryption together suggests that the malware is using protocol tunneling to bypass security measures.

**Final Answer: D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
