Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with enticing a victim to interact with a malicious link leading to trojanized files under the guise of 'Know Your Customer' banking procedures.
   - The subsequent step is the removal of attack artifacts through a script named 'DeleteLeftovers'.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is the use of a malicious link to deliver trojanized files, which aligns with the 'Know Your Customer' banking procedures.
   - The second TTP is the removal of attack artifacts, which is a cleanup step to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it could be used to execute the 'DeleteLeftovers' script, it doesn't directly address the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **B: T1585-Establish Accounts:** This technique involves creating or using accounts to establish a foothold or maintain access. It does not align with the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It is not related to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell:** This sub-technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands. It is a plausible method to execute a script like 'DeleteLeftovers' to remove attack artifacts.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of executing a script to remove attack artifacts, is the use of a command shell to run the 'DeleteLeftovers' script.

Final Answer: D
