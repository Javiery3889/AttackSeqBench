Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: using leaked-data search engines and forums to gather intelligence.
   - The next step involves acquiring new PoS and ATM skimmers, as well as social engineering toolkits for social engineering attacks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is reconnaissance, which involves gathering intelligence.
   - The next step is acquiring tools and techniques to carry out the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1597-Search Closed Sources**
     - This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources, which aligns with using leaked-data search engines and forums.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
     - This technique involves acquiring the ability to perform a specific action, which could be relevant to obtaining skimmers and social engineering toolkits.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when a system boots or a user logs on. It does not directly align with the acquisition of tools.
   - **D: T1584.005-Botnet**
     - This technique involves using a botnet to perform actions, which is not directly related to the acquisition of skimmers and social engineering toolkits.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of gathering intelligence and then acquiring tools.
   - T1597 (Search Closed Sources) fits the initial gathering of intelligence.
   - T1588 (Obtain Capabilities) fits the acquisition of the tools and techniques needed for the attack.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the attack sequence described, is T1597 followed by T1588.
   - However, since the question asks for a single answer choice that forms the most plausible sequence, and T1588 is the most direct fit for acquiring the necessary tools and techniques, the best answer is T1588.

Final Answer: B
