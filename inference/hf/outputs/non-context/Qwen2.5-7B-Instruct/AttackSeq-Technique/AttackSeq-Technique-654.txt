To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Rootkit Usage**: The question mentions the use of a rootkit to hide files on disk for persistence. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1059.002 - Rootkit**.

2. **DLL Replacement**: The question states that the rootkit replaced the path to a DLL of an existing unused service. This is a technique to maintain persistence and can be categorized under **T1070.003 - DLL Search Order Hijacking**.

3. **Network Traffic Encapsulation**: The question mentions that Comfoo's network traffic was encrypted and encapsulated in HTTP requests and responses for Command and Control. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique **T1021.001 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence before the network traffic was encrypted and encapsulated in HTTP requests and responses for Command and Control.

- **A: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**: This technique involves using the .NET AppDomainManager to execute arbitrary code. It does not directly relate to the encapsulation of network traffic in HTTP.

- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots or video of the screen. It is not relevant to the encapsulation of network traffic.

- **C: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data. While it can be a method of data exfiltration, it does not directly relate to the encapsulation of network traffic in HTTP.

- **D: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through a third party. This can be a method to encapsulate traffic in HTTP for Command and Control, making it a plausible technique that could occur after the rootkit and DLL replacement but before the network traffic is encrypted and encapsulated in HTTP.

Given the sequence and the techniques involved, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy
