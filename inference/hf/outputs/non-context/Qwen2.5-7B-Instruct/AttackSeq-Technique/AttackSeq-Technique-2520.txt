Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that BlueDelta exploited Roundcube vulnerabilities to perform discovery activities on system and network information.
   - It then asks which technique occurred before securing sensitive victim credentials such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
     - This technique involves dumping credentials from the operating system. The question specifies that this occurred after the discovery activities and before securing sensitive credentials, so this does not fit the sequence.
   - **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network and system configurations. The question states that BlueDelta performed discovery activities on system and network information, which aligns with this technique.
   - **C: T1547.014-Active Setup**
     - This technique involves setting up and configuring systems to run malicious code. It does not fit the sequence as it is not a discovery activity.
   - **D: T1187-Forced Authentication**
     - This technique involves forcing a user to authenticate to a system. It does not fit the sequence as it is not a discovery activity and does not precede credential dumping.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers first performed discovery activities (T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery) and then secured sensitive credentials (T1003-OS Credential Dumping).

Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
