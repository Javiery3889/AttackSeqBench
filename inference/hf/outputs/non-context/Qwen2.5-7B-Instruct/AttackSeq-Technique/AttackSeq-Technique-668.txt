To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution, let's analyze each step and the provided answer choices.

1. **Global Mutex**: This technique is used to ensure that only one instance of a malicious process runs at a time, which helps in preventing detection by other security tools that monitor running processes.

2. **Runtime API Address Resolution**: This technique involves resolving API addresses at runtime to avoid detection by static analysis tools that look for hardcoded API addresses.

Given these techniques, the next step in the attack sequence would likely be to further obfuscate the malicious activities to avoid detection by other means. Let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **T1070.007-Clear Network Connection History and Configurations**: This technique involves clearing network connection history and configurations to avoid detection by network monitoring tools. While this is a valid technique, it is more focused on network activity and not directly related to the obfuscation of the malicious process itself.

B. **T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating data to make it harder for defenders to understand the true nature of the data being exfiltrated or manipulated. However, it is more about data rather than the process itself.

C. **T1547.012-Print Processors**: This technique involves using print processors to execute code, which can be used to evade detection by process monitoring tools. This is a plausible next step after ensuring the process is not detected by a global mutex and runtime API address resolution.

D. **T1622-Debugger Evasion**: This technique involves techniques to prevent the debugger from being attached to a process, which is a method to avoid analysis. While this is a valid technique, it is more about preventing analysis rather than further obfuscation of the process.

Given the context of the attack sequence, the most plausible next step would be to use a technique that further obfuscates the process to avoid detection, which aligns with the use of print processors to execute code.

Final Answer: C
