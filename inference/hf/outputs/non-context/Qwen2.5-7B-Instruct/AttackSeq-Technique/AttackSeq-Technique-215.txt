Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the initial access was achieved through aviation-related spear-phishing emails. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique, which involves using spear-phishing emails to deliver malware.

2. **Elirks Malware**: The malware used is Elirks, which is known for its use in cyber-attacks, particularly in the context of initial access and lateral movement.

3. **C2 Server Contact**: The malware establishes contact with a C2 server by accessing pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services. This suggests a method of communication that is not through traditional means like domain names but rather through social media or microblogging platforms.

4. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**: This technique involves using domain controller credentials to gain access to network resources. It does not align with the described method of using social media or microblogging services.
   - **B: T1087.003-Email Account**: This technique involves using email accounts to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. While it is related to email, it does not align with the described method of using social media or microblogging services.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. This could align with the described method of using social media or microblogging services, as these platforms often use web services.
   - **D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**: This technique involves using domain generation algorithms to generate a list of domain names for C2 servers. While this is a method of C2 communication, it does not align with the described method of using social media or microblogging services.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve using a web service to communicate with the C2 server, as this aligns with the described method of using social media or microblogging services.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
