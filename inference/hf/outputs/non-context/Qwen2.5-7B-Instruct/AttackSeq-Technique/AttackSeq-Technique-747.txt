To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for maintaining persistent access to the victim's system, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice.

1. **Reconnaissance Tool Execution**: This suggests the initial phase of gathering information about the target system.
2. **RAT (Remote Access Tool) Retrieved as Binaries**: This indicates that a malicious tool was downloaded and executed on the victim's system.

For maintaining persistent access, the attacker would need to ensure that the RAT remains active and undetected. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying a system process to maintain persistence. While this could be a method to keep the RAT running, it doesn't directly address the need for maintaining access over time.

B. **T1546.016-Installer Packages**: This technique involves using installer packages to deploy malware. This is more about the initial deployment rather than maintaining persistence.

C. **T1569-System Services**: This technique involves creating or modifying a system service to maintain persistence. System services are a common method to ensure that a malicious process runs at system startup, making it harder to detect and remove.

D. **T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-standard or unencrypted protocol. This is more about data exfiltration rather than maintaining access.

Given the context of maintaining persistent access, the most relevant technique is one that ensures the RAT remains active and undetected over time. System services (T1569) are a well-known method to achieve this.

**Final Answer: C: T1569-System Services**
