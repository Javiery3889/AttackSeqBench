Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
   - They created public registry accounts that mimicked popular software or packages.
   - They tricked developers into pulling and running malicious container images.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** - This technique involves the creation and use of domain accounts for malicious purposes. The scenario does not mention the use of domain accounts, so this is not relevant.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise** - This technique involves compromising a supply chain to deliver malicious code. The scenario describes attackers creating malicious container images that developers would pull, which fits the definition of a supply chain compromise.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves the use of web services for malicious purposes. While the scenario involves a web service (the public registry), the primary TTP here is the supply chain compromise, not the use of the web service itself.
   - **D: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice** - This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing. The scenario does not mention any voice-based communication, so this is not relevant.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs in the given scenario is best described by T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, as it directly addresses the attackers' actions of creating and distributing malicious container images through a public registry.

Final Answer: B
