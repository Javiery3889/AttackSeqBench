Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the Lazarus Group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement within the network.
   - It then asks about the technique used to communicate with C2 servers using disguised domains hosted on various countries' resources.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is the use of compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.
   - The next TTP is the communication with C2 servers using disguised domains.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves the use of malicious content to entice users to provide sensitive information. It does not directly relate to the use of disguised domains for C2 communication.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. While it could be used for communication, it does not specifically address the use of disguised domains.
   - **C: T1115-Clipboard Data** - This technique involves the use of clipboard data to exfiltrate information. It is not relevant to the communication with C2 servers using disguised domains.
   - **D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms** - This technique involves the use of algorithms to generate a large number of domain names that can be used for C2 communication. This aligns well with the use of disguised domains hosted on various countries' resources.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) to generate disguised domains for C2 communication.

Final Answer: D
