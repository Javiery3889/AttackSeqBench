To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
- **Rocket Kitten** utilized hard-coded IP addresses with GET requests from **GHOLE malware** as part of their C&C (Command and Control) communication.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial C&C communication.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
- This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it could be a subsequent step to hide the malware or its communications, it doesn't directly relate to the C&C communication described.

**B: T1090.002-External Proxy**
- This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. This could be a method to bypass network security measures and maintain C&C communications, but it is not directly related to the initial C&C communication using hard-coded IP addresses.

**C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
- This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems. While it could be a step to maintain persistence or access, it is not directly related to the C&C communication described.

**D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
- This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. Since the initial communication was via GET requests (an application layer protocol), it is logical that the next step would involve further use of application layer protocols to maintain or extend the C&C communication.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial C&C Communication**: Rocket Kitten used hard-coded IP addresses with GET requests (application layer protocol) for C&C.
2. **Next Step**: To maintain or extend this C&C communication, the attackers would likely continue to use application layer protocols to ensure the communication remains undetected and functional.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the initial C&C communication using application layer protocols, is to continue using application layer protocols for further C&C communication.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
