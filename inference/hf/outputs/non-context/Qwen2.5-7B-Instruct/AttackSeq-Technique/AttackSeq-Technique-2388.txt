To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before LightNeuron exfiltrated data through the email C&C channel and scheduled transfers during specific times, let's analyze each option in the context of the described attack sequence.

1. **T1553.004-Install Root Certificate (A)**:
   - This technique involves installing a root certificate to establish a trusted connection. While it can be used to facilitate data exfiltration, it is not directly related to the exfiltration method (email C&C channel) or the scheduling of transfers.

2. **T1119-Automated Collection (B)**:
   - This technique involves the automated collection of data. It is a plausible step before exfiltration, as it would involve gathering the data that is later exfiltrated. However, it does not directly address the scheduling of transfers.

3. **T1020.001-Traffic Duplication (C)**:
   - This technique involves duplicating network traffic to evade detection. While it can be a part of an overall attack strategy, it is not directly related to the exfiltration method or the scheduling of transfers.

4. **T1029-Scheduled Transfer (D)**:
   - This technique involves scheduling the transfer of data at specific times. Given that the question mentions "scheduled transfers during specific times," this technique directly aligns with the described behavior.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the automated collection of data (T1119) followed by the scheduling of transfers (T1029). However, since the question asks which technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration through the email C&C channel and scheduled transfers, the most direct and relevant technique is T1029-Scheduled Transfer.

**Final Answer: D**
