Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two TTPs:
     - **HTML Smuggling (T1136)**: Used to bypass security controls.
     - **DLL Hijacking (T1574.001)**: A malicious DLL was loaded into a legitimate process for defense evasion.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS**: This technique involves the use of DNS queries to exfiltrate data or to perform reconnaissance. It does not directly follow the sequence of HTML Smuggling and DLL Hijacking.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to evade detection. While it is related to shared code, it does not directly follow the sequence of HTML Smuggling and DLL Hijacking.
   - **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding from files or information. It could be a step after the DLL is loaded, but it is not directly related to the loading process.
   - **D: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of the intended one. This directly follows the DLL Hijacking technique mentioned in the question.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question states that a malicious DLL was loaded via DLL Hijacking into a legitimate process. The next logical step would be to ensure that the DLL is not detected or removed by security measures. Among the given options, T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking is the most relevant and directly follows the DLL Hijacking technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
