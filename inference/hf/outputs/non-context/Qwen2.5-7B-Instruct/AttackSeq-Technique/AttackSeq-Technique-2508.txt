Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already gained remote access to hotel front desks and stolen credit card details.
   - The next step involves collecting additional data by monitoring OTA (Online Travel Agency) websites and hotel personnel activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers are looking to gather more information beyond the stolen credit card details.
   - They are specifically targeting data from OTA websites and hotel personnel activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture** - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to monitoring external websites or hotel personnel activities.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not the context of monitoring external data sources.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories** - This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, which could include monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities to gather additional data.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools** - This technique involves deploying software to achieve a malicious purpose, which is not directly related to the described monitoring activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers need to gather more data, which suggests they are looking to access or monitor additional sources of information.
   - Monitoring OTA websites and hotel personnel activities implies accessing data from these sources, which aligns with the "Data from Information Repositories" technique.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1213-Data from Information Repositories.

Final Answer: C
