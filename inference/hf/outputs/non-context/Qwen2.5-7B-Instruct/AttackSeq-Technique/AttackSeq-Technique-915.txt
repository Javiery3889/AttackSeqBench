To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Tuyul botnet first gains access to victim systems and then executes commands using 'shell' and 'perl' functionalities.
   - The key point is identifying the technique that enables access to the vulnerable systems before executing commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access. This could be a plausible initial step if the botnet targets a specific application or service.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection to the target system. This could also be a plausible initial step, especially if the botnet uses a remote service to gain access.
   - **C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call:** This technique is related to making remote procedure calls, which is more about executing commands rather than gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. This is a step that occurs after gaining access, not the initial access itself.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question asks for the technique that enables access to the vulnerable systems, which is the initial step.
   - Both T1190 and T1133 are plausible for initial access.
   - T1055.004 and T1059 are related to command execution, not initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the question is asking for the technique that enables access, and both T1190 and T1133 are plausible, we need to consider which one is more commonly associated with gaining access to systems.
   - T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) is often used in scenarios where the botnet targets a specific application or service, which is a common method for gaining initial access.
   - T1133 (External Remote Services) is also a common method but is more general and less specific to a particular application.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for enabling access to the vulnerable systems is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

Final Answer: A
