To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Harvesting Credentials via Spear-Phishing and OLDBAIT**: 
   - Spear-phishing involves sending malicious emails to targeted individuals to steal credentials.
   - OLDBAIT is a technique where attackers use old, known vulnerabilities to gain access to systems.

2. **Moving Deeper into Victim Networks**:
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers need a method to move laterally within the network and maintain persistence.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**:
   - This technique involves exploiting a service running on a remote system to gain access or perform actions.
   - This could be relevant if the attackers are looking to exploit another service within the network to move further.

B. **T1021.007-Cloud Services**:
   - This technique involves using cloud services to exfiltrate data or maintain access.
   - It does not directly relate to moving laterally within the network.

C. **T1653-Power Settings**:
   - This technique involves manipulating power settings to evade detection.
   - It is not directly related to moving laterally within the network.

D. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**:
   - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection.
   - While useful for maintaining persistence, it does not directly relate to moving laterally within the network.

Given the context of moving deeper into the network after initial access, the most relevant technique would be one that allows the attackers to exploit another service or system within the network. **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** fits this description best.

**Final Answer: A**
