Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the Sednit group gathered information about the victim's system through a spoofed URL.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the group ensured persistence using a scheduled task.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The spoofed URL is a method of delivering a payload, which is a form of phishing.
   - Ensuring persistence using a scheduled task is a technique to maintain access to the victim's system over time.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice** - This technique involves using voice phishing to gather information. The question mentions a spoofed URL, not voice phishing, so this is not the correct choice.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique is about creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence. The question asks which technique occurred before this, so this is a potential candidate but needs to be evaluated in context.
   - **C: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable** - This technique involves modifying the kernel to gain persistence. This is not directly related to the spoofed URL mentioned in the question, so it is less likely.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to deliver a payload, which aligns with the spoofed URL mentioned in the question. This is the most likely technique to occur before ensuring persistence with a scheduled task.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the group used phishing (T1566) to gather information through a spoofed URL, and then used a scheduled task (T1053) to ensure persistence.

Final Answer: D
