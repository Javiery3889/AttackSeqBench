To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Shuckworm used `mshta.exe` for bypassing application control solutions and browser security settings, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. While it is a relevant technique, it does not directly relate to the use of `mshta.exe` for execution or bypassing security measures.

2. **T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves deploying containers to execute malicious code. It is more about the method of deployment rather than the execution method used by `mshta.exe`.

3. **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative methods to authenticate to a system or service. It is not directly related to the execution of `mshta.exe` or bypassing security measures.

4. **T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution**: This technique involves executing a system binary through a proxy or wrapper to bypass security controls. `mshta.exe` is often used to execute malicious payloads in a way that bypasses security measures, such as application control solutions and browser security settings. This technique directly aligns with the use of `mshta.exe` for such purposes.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that `mshta.exe` was used after some form of proxy or wrapper was employed to bypass security controls. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the use of `mshta.exe` for the described purpose is T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution.

Final Answer: D
