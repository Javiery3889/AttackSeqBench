To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Leveraging Proxy Tools**: The question mentions the use of proxy tools like Ngrok. Ngrok is typically used to expose local services to the internet, which can be a precursor to establishing a communication channel with a malicious external website.

2. **Lateral Movement and Data Exfiltration**: After establishing a connection, the next steps would be to move laterally within the network and exfiltrate data. This involves using a method to communicate with the external malicious website.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves the use of traffic signaling to establish a covert channel. While it could be used for communication, it doesn't directly follow the use of proxy tools for lateral movement and data exfiltration.

B. **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to avoid detection. This could be a method used after establishing a connection with a malicious external website, but it doesn't directly follow the use of proxy tools for lateral movement and data exfiltration.

C. **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using web services to establish a command and control (C2) channel. This is a plausible step after leveraging proxy tools to establish communication with a malicious external website, as it directly relates to the communication aspect.

D. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. While this could be part of the data exfiltration process, it doesn't directly follow the use of proxy tools for establishing communication with a malicious external website.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible next step after leveraging proxy tools for lateral movement and data exfiltration would be to use a web service to establish communication with a malicious external website.

Final Answer: C
