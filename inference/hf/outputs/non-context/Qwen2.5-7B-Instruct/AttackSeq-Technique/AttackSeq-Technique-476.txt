To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that Trickbot gained initial access to the victim's system through spam emails containing a Microsoft Word document with an enabled macro. This is a common method for delivering malware.

2. **Next Steps**: After gaining initial access, the next steps would typically involve establishing a foothold, maintaining persistence, and potentially executing commands or scripts to further compromise the system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While this could be a step after gaining initial access, it is more about executing commands rather than establishing persistence or further compromising the system.

B. **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute code when PowerShell starts. This is a common method for maintaining persistence and executing malicious code. It aligns well with the next logical step after gaining initial access, as it helps the attacker to maintain control over the system.

C. **T1609-Container Administration Command**: This technique involves using container administration commands to manage containers. This is less likely to be the next step after gaining initial access, as it is more specialized and less common in typical attack sequences.

D. **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. This is more about the initial transfer of tools rather than the next step after gaining access.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining initial access through a Microsoft Word document with an enabled macro would be to establish persistence and maintain control over the system.

**Final Answer: B (T1546.013-PowerShell Profile)**
