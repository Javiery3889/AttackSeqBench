Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Using tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, and net user commands to understand the network environment.
     - Subsequently, using BRONZE PRESIDENT's methods (which include Wmiexec and net commands) for lateral movement.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the initial reconnaissance phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial phase involves network reconnaissance and enumeration.
   - The subsequent phase involves lateral movement using remote services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows registry, which is not directly related to the initial network reconnaissance phase.
   - **B: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to establish a connection to a remote host. This aligns with the use of Wmiexec and net commands for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This is the same as B, so it is redundant.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control. While it is related to network communication, it is not specifically about the initial reconnaissance phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial phase (using Nmap, Nbtscan, and net user commands) is about understanding the network environment.
   - The next phase (using Wmiexec and net commands) is about moving laterally within the network.
   - T1021-Remote Services (both B and C) directly aligns with the use of Wmiexec and net commands for establishing connections and moving laterally.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is T1021-Remote Services.

Final Answer: C
