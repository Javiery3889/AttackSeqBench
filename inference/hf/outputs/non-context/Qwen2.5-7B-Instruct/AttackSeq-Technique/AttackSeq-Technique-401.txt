Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described involves enabling Macro content to execute a payload through `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`.
   - This is followed by SSL communication with a command and control server using an expired digital certificate.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. While it fits the SSL communication part, it does not specifically address the use of an expired digital certificate.
   - **B: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique involves bootkits, which are malware that infect the boot process of a computer. It does not directly relate to the SSL communication or the use of an expired digital certificate.
   - **C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
     - This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not directly related to the SSL communication or the use of an expired digital certificate.
   - **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to the SSL communication or the use of an expired digital certificate.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question specifically mentions SSL communication with an expired digital certificate. The technique that best fits this description is one that involves the use of SSL/TLS for C2 communications, which is covered by T1071.
   - However, T1071 does not specifically mention the use of an expired digital certificate. The use of an expired digital certificate is more closely related to the use of a weak or compromised certificate, which is not directly covered by T1071.

Given the options, the closest match to the described sequence of TTPs is T1071, as it covers the SSL communication aspect. However, none of the options perfectly match the use of an expired digital certificate. If we must choose the most plausible based on the given options, T1071 is the best fit.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
