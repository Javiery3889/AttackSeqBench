Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where initial access to target systems is achieved via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded macros.
   - Before this initial access, the question asks about the ATT&CK technique used for gathering information about potential victims.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is: Gathering information about potential victims → Phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded macros → Initial access to target systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1565-Data Manipulation:** This technique involves altering data to achieve a malicious purpose. It does not fit the context of gathering information about potential victims.
   - **B: T1596.003-Digital Certificates:** This technique involves the use of digital certificates to establish trust and legitimacy. It is not directly related to gathering information about potential victims.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information about potential victims. This fits the context of the question as it directly relates to the gathering of information before the initial access via phishing emails.
   - **D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases:** This technique involves searching open technical databases for information. While it can be a method to gather information, it is not as directly related to the phishing context as T1598.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1598-Phishing for Information.

Final Answer: C
