To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Earth Wendigo used a Service Worker script to intercept HTTPS POST requests and steal webmail login credentials, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1557.004-Evil Twin (A)**: This technique involves setting up a rogue access point to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While it can be used to intercept HTTPS POST requests, it is more of a setup technique rather than a direct precursor to the specific action of using a Service Worker script.

2. **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (B)**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one intended. It is more relevant to the exfiltration phase rather than the initial setup or interception phase.

3. **T1021.006-Windows Remote Management (C)**: This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to establish a remote management session. It is not directly related to intercepting HTTPS POST requests or using a Service Worker script.

4. **T1056-Input Capture (D)**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or form submissions. It is closely related to intercepting HTTPS POST requests and stealing webmail login credentials, as it involves capturing the user's input data.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that the attacker first needed to capture the user's input (login credentials) before using a Service Worker script to intercept and steal them. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the use of a Service Worker script is T1056-Input Capture.

**Final Answer: D**
