Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the attackers modified the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file on the Afghan Government's CDN server to load additional malicious code.
   - This action is described as a form of drive-by compromise, where a user's browser is tricked into executing malicious code without their knowledge.
   - The attackers then used the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to evade detection.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack:** This technique involves an attacker downgrading a protocol or service to a less secure version. It does not align with the described scenario of modifying a JavaScript file to load additional malicious code.
   - **B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache to redirect traffic to a malicious host. It is not directly related to modifying a JavaScript file or using a packer to evade detection.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a user's system through a web page that automatically executes malicious code. This aligns well with the scenario of modifying a JavaScript file to load additional malicious code.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to make them harder to detect or understand. This aligns with the use of the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to evade detection.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves a drive-by compromise (modifying the JavaScript file) followed by evasion (using a packer to obfuscate the code).
   - While T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is used for evasion, T1189-Drive-by Compromise is the initial technique that leads to the need for evasion.

**Final Answer: C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
