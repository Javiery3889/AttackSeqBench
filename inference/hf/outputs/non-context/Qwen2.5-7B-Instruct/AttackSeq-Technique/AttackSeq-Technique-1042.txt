To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The question mentions "uploading tools like Mimikatz for credential access." This indicates that the initial step involves deploying a tool to gain access to credentials.
   - "Emissary Panda maintained access and evaded defenses using the China Chopper webshell" suggests that after gaining initial access, the adversary used a webshell to maintain persistence and evade detection.

2. **Evaluating Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
     - This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table to hide or alter system calls. While it can be used to hide artifacts, it is not directly related to the initial credential access or the maintenance of access using a webshell.
   - **B: T1112-Modify Registry**
     - This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to maintain persistence or evade detection. It is a common method for maintaining access and evading defenses, but it is not the first step in the sequence.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, processes, and network connections to avoid detection. While it is useful for maintaining access and evading defenses, it is not the initial step in the sequence.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using software deployment tools to install or deploy malicious software. This aligns well with the initial step of uploading tools like Mimikatz for credential access.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step in the sequence is the deployment of tools like Mimikatz, which is best described by T1072-Software Deployment Tools.
   - After deploying the tools, the adversary would likely use them to gain credentials (which is not directly listed but implied by the initial step).
   - Then, the adversary would maintain access and evade defenses using a webshell, which could involve techniques like T1112-Modify Registry or T1564-Hide Artifacts, but these are not the first steps in the sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described in the question, starts with the deployment of tools like Mimikatz.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools.

Final Answer: D
