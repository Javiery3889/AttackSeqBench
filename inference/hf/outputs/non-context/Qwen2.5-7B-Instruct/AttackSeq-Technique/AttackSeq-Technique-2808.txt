To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Grandoreiro used RealThinClient SDK over HTTP for Command and Control (C2) after collecting information about its victims.
   - The information collected includes the computer name, username, operating system version, and bitness.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves deploying software to a target system. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it doesn't directly relate to the information gathering phase described in the question.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for C2. Given that Grandoreiro used RealThinClient SDK over HTTP for C2, this technique aligns well with the described sequence.
   - **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
     - This technique involves manipulating ARP tables to redirect traffic. It is more relevant to network-level attacks and does not directly relate to the information gathering or C2 phase described.
   - **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. While it could be a part of the attack, it is not directly related to the information gathering phase described in the question.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Grandoreiro first gathers information about its victims and then uses a specific C2 method (RealThinClient SDK over HTTP).
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol (B) is the most relevant technique because it directly relates to the use of an application layer protocol (HTTP) for C2, which is the method used by Grandoreiro after the information gathering phase.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
