To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Mustang Panda used execution methods involving benign executables to side-load malicious DLLs for deploying the PlugX implant.**
   - This indicates that the initial step involved using benign executables to load malicious DLLs, which is a form of code injection.

2. **Identifying the correct ATT&CK technique:**
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (A)**: This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when a system boots or a user logs on. While this is a common technique, it doesn't directly address the method of loading malicious DLLs into benign executables.
   - **T1037.003-Network Logon Script (B)**: This technique involves using network logon scripts to execute malicious code. This is not directly related to the method of loading DLLs into benign executables.
   - **T1547.009-Shortcut Modification (C)**: This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code. While this can be a method to execute code, it is not directly related to the method of loading DLLs into benign executables.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules (D)**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. This is closely related to the method of loading malicious DLLs into benign executables, as it involves the use of shared modules to execute code.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the technique that directly addresses the method of loading malicious DLLs into benign executables, which is best described by T1129-Shared Modules.

**Final Answer: D**
