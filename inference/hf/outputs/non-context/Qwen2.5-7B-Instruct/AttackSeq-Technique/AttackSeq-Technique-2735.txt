To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Lazarus group conducted network share and system service discovery using ThreatNeedle malware, we need to analyze the sequence of actions and the prerequisites for such an attack.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The Lazarus group used ThreatNeedle malware to perform network share and system service discovery.
   - This implies that the malware was already installed and operational within the target environment.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves deploying software to a target system. While it could be a precursor to malware installation, it is not specifically about network share or service discovery.
   - **B: T1087.002-Domain Account**: This technique involves using a domain account to gain access to a system. This could be a step in gaining initial access but does not directly relate to network share or service discovery.
   - **C: T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves the use of domains for command and control (C2) communications. It is more about establishing a communication channel rather than discovering services or shares.
   - **D: T1007-System Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering services running on a system. Given that the malware is used for collecting details on services, this is a direct precursor to the action described.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The Lazarus group would need to first discover the services running on the system before using ThreatNeedle to collect details on them.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the network share and system service discovery is the discovery of the services themselves.

**Final Answer: D: T1007-System Service Discovery**
