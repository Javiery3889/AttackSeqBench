To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Milestone backdoor sent session information to the C2 server over an uncompressed communication channel, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting content into a system or application. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly relate to the communication channel or session information being sent to the C2 server.

2. **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating software on a system. While it could be a preparatory step, it doesn't directly relate to the communication channel or session information being sent to the C2 server.

3. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control. This is directly related to the communication channel and session information being sent to the C2 server. However, it is more about the method of communication rather than a preparatory step.

4. **T1014-Rootkit**: This technique involves the use of rootkits to maintain persistence and hide malicious activities. Rootkits can be used to establish a foothold and ensure that the backdoor can communicate with the C2 server. This is a preparatory step that would likely occur before the backdoor sends session information to the C2 server.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that a rootkit is used to establish a foothold and maintain persistence, which would then allow the Milestone backdoor to send session information to the C2 server over an uncompressed communication channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1014-Rootkit**
