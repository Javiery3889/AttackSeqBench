To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Base64-built files on the host to expose misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access**: This indicates that the attackers used a technique to gain initial access to the system by exploiting misconfigurations in Docker API ports.

2. **Established contact with C2 servers via encoded binaries compiled from decoded snippets**: This suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers used encoded binaries to communicate with their Command and Control (C2) servers, likely to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1611-Escape to Host**: This technique involves an attacker moving from a guest virtual machine to the host system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers via encoded binaries.

B. **T1134-Access Token Manipulation**: This technique involves an attacker using stolen or misused access tokens to gain elevated privileges. This is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers via encoded binaries.

C. **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from the target environment. Given that the attackers used encoded binaries to communicate with C2 servers, this could be a plausible next step to exfiltrate data.

D. **T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to a cloud storage service. While this could be a plausible step, it is more specific than the general automated exfiltration mentioned in T1020.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible next step after establishing contact with C2 servers via encoded binaries would be the automated exfiltration of data.

**Final Answer: C**
