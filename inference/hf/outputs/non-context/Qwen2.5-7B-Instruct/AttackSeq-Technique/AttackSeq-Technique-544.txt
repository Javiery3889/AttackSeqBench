Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors gained initial access via spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure** - This technique involves acquiring or establishing access to systems or networks. It is not directly related to the initial access via spearphishing.
   - **B: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood** - This technique involves overwhelming a system with requests to exhaust resources. It is not relevant to the initial access via spearphishing.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise** - This technique involves compromising a third-party system to gain access to the target organization. While it can be a method to prepare for an attack, it is not directly related to the initial access via spearphishing.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious files. Spearphishing is a form of phishing, and the use of malicious Word documents with VBA macros is a specific method of phishing.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions "spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros" as the method of initial access.
   - Among the given options, T1566-Phishing (D) is the most directly related to the described method of initial access.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
