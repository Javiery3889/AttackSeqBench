To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Downloader Execution**: The question mentions that a Delphi downloader executed the 'cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST' process to gather initial information. This indicates that the first step is the execution of a specific command to gather system information.

2. **Information Gathering**: After the initial information is gathered, the next step is the use of WMI objects and other reconnaissance techniques to gather more detailed information on the victim's computer. This suggests that the attacker needs to discover more about the system's processes and possibly its configuration.

3. **Process Discovery**: The ATT&CK technique T1057-Process Discovery is specifically designed to gather information about running processes on a system. This aligns well with the next step after gathering initial system information, as it helps the attacker understand the current state of the system and identify potential targets or points of interest.

4. **Other Techniques**: 
   - **T1037.005-Startup Items**: This technique involves identifying and modifying startup items to ensure persistence. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the immediate information gathering phase.
   - **T1597-Search Closed Sources**: This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources, which is not directly related to the immediate process discovery phase.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the system owner or user, which is also a step that could follow process discovery but is not the immediate next step after gathering initial system information.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the need to understand the current state of the system before proceeding with more detailed reconnaissance, the most plausible next step is T1057-Process Discovery.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
