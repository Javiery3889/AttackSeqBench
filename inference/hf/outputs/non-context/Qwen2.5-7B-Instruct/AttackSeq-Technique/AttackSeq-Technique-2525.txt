To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before BlueDelta exploited Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities to gather system information, network configuration, owner/user details, and network connections, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1110.004-Credential Stuffing (A)**: This technique involves using lists of known credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems. While it could be a precursor to exploiting vulnerabilities, the question specifies gathering system information and network configuration, which is more directly related to reconnaissance and post-exploitation activities.

2. **T1592-Gather Victim Host Information (B)**: This technique involves collecting information about the target host, such as system and network details. This aligns closely with the information gathering phase before exploiting vulnerabilities, as it would provide the necessary context and details to exploit the Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities effectively.

3. **T1614.001-System Language Discovery (C)**: This technique involves determining the language of the system to tailor the attack or evade detection. While it is a part of the reconnaissance phase, it is more specific and less directly related to the broad scope of information gathering mentioned in the question.

4. **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery (D)**: This technique involves discovering network configuration details, such as IP addresses, network topology, and services running on the network. This is highly relevant to the question as it directly pertains to gathering network configuration, which is part of the information that would be needed to exploit vulnerabilities effectively.

Given the need to gather a broad range of information including system information, network configuration, owner/user details, and network connections, the most plausible sequence would start with gathering victim host information, which encompasses a wide range of details necessary for the subsequent exploitation.

**Final Answer: B: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
