To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The attack sequence involves the use of Grandoreiro malware, which employs techniques to evade detection, such as hooking APIs to prevent the loading of DLLs of banking protection software and checking for debugging tools.
   - The next step in the sequence is to collect information about the username and other system details.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves identifying network connections and services on a host. While it can provide useful information, it is not directly related to collecting username and system details.
   - **B: T1574.012-COR_PROFILER:** This technique involves using the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) profiler to gather information about the application. It is not directly related to collecting username and system details.
   - **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system owner or user, which directly aligns with the goal of collecting the username and other system details.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection:** This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or modify its behavior. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not directly related to collecting username and system details.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the malware is collecting information about the username and other system details.
   - Among the given options, T1033-System Owner/User Discovery is the most relevant technique for this purpose.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1033-System Owner/User Discovery.

Final Answer: C
