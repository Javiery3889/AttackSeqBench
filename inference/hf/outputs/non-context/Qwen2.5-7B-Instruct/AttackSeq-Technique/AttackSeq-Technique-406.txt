To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Gholee (a malware or threat actor) establishes communication with a command and control (C2) server using an expired SSL certificate for HTTP GET and POST requests to /index.php.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs involved here are related to establishing a C2 channel, which includes the use of an expired SSL certificate and HTTP requests.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to the use of an expired SSL certificate or HTTP requests.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for data exfiltration or command and control. While it is related to communication, it does not specifically address the use of an expired SSL certificate.
   - **C: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves the use of digital certificates, including expired or invalid certificates, to establish trust and evade detection. This directly aligns with the use of an expired SSL certificate.
   - **D: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media for data exfiltration or command and control. It does not relate to the use of an expired SSL certificate or HTTP requests.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions the use of an expired SSL certificate for HTTP GET and POST requests. This directly points to the use of digital certificates.
   - Among the given choices, T1596.003-Digital Certificates (C) is the only one that directly addresses the use of digital certificates, including expired ones.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: C: T1596.003-Digital Certificates
