Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Gamaredon's modules used HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (C2).
   - It then asks about the technique that most likely occurred when these modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves using C2 channels (HTTP and HTTPS) and then exfiltrating data (harvested documents) to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**
     - This technique is about limiting the size of data transferred, which does not directly relate to the exfiltration of harvested documents.
   - **B: T1137.006-Add-ins**
     - This technique involves using add-ins to perform malicious actions, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique specifically involves exfiltrating data over a C2 channel, which aligns with the scenario of uploading harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to perform malicious actions, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, as it directly relates to the exfiltration of harvested documents over the C2 channel (HTTP and HTTPS).

Final Answer: C
