Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a custom tunneling tool is used for data exfiltration.
   - The goal is to enable communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments.
   - This communication is facilitated through a compromised router.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The use of a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration suggests that the attacker is using a non-standard method to move data out of the network.
   - The communication between the corporate and restricted network segments via a compromised router indicates that the attacker is using the compromised router to route traffic between these segments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1070.006-Timestomp** - This technique involves modifying the timestamp of files to evade detection. It does not align with the scenario of using a compromised router for communication.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic. While it could be a method to route traffic, the question specifically mentions a compromised router, not a proxy.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** - This technique involves discovering network configurations. It does not align with the scenario of using a compromised router for communication.
   - **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using a protocol that is not part of the application layer (e.g., ICMP, TCP, UDP) to exfiltrate data. However, the question is more about enabling communication between network segments via a compromised router, which is more closely aligned with T1098.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the scenario of using a compromised router to enable communication between the corporate and restricted network segments is T1098, which is not listed in the choices. However, the closest match in the given choices is T1095, as it involves using a protocol that is not part of the application layer, which could be used to route traffic through a compromised router.

Final Answer: D
