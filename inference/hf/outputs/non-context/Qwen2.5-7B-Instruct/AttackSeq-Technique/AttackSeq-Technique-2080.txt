Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack starts with "Drive-by Compromise" and "malvertising or compromised websites." This aligns with the T1213 technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves adversaries using malicious advertisements or compromised websites to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Execution of Obfuscated PowerShell Script**: The next step is the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell script. This is a common technique used to execute malicious code in a way that is difficult to detect and analyze. The technique that best fits this description is T1059.003 - Command and Scripting Interpreter - PowerShell, which involves using PowerShell to execute commands or scripts.

3. **Fetching Malware**: The PowerShell script is used to fetch malware. This action is best described by T1091 - External Remote Services, which involves adversaries using remote services to download and execute malware.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**: This technique involves modifying the PowerShell profile to execute code when PowerShell starts. While this can be used to execute scripts, it is not the most direct or common method for executing an obfuscated script to fetch malware.

B. **T1053.003-Cron**: This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule and run commands. This is not typically used for executing obfuscated PowerShell scripts to fetch malware, as it is more about scheduling tasks rather than executing scripts in real-time.

C. **T1588-Obtain Capabilities**: This technique involves adversaries obtaining system capabilities, which is a broader category and not specific to executing scripts or fetching malware.

D. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This is the most relevant technique for executing a PowerShell script. T1059 involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts, which aligns with the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.

**Final Answer: D**
