Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware executed a fake decoy document using the RichEdit function.
   - The malware then protected shellcode in memory through hijacking a DLL using `localAlloc` and `VirtualProtect`.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which doesn't directly align with the sequence of executing a fake decoy document and protecting shellcode in memory.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters, which also doesn't directly align with the sequence of executing a fake decoy document and protecting shellcode in memory.
   - **C: T1525-Implant Internal Image**
     - This technique involves embedding malicious code within a legitimate image file, which could be part of the fake decoy document. However, it doesn't directly align with the next step of protecting shellcode in memory.
   - **D: T1070.005-Network Share Connection Removal**
     - This technique involves removing network share connections, which is not directly related to the sequence of executing a fake decoy document and protecting shellcode in memory.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves executing a fake decoy document and then protecting the shellcode in memory. The technique that best fits the step of protecting shellcode in memory through hijacking a DLL using `localAlloc` and `VirtualProtect` is not directly listed in the choices. However, the closest and most plausible technique that could be part of the sequence is T1525-Implant Internal Image, as it involves embedding malicious code, which could be part of the fake decoy document.

**Final Answer: C: T1525-Implant Internal Image**
