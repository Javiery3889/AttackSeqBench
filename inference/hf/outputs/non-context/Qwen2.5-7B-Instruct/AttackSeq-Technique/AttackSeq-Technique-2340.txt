Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that APT12 used spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158 for initial access. This is a clear indication of a social engineering attack.
   - The next part of the question focuses on Command and Control (C2) involving HIGHTIDE's communication with an IP address.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:** This technique involves the use of dynamic DNS (DDNS) or other mechanisms to resolve domain names at runtime. While this can be used in C2, it doesn't directly address the encrypted or encoded nature of the communication.
   - **B: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File:** This technique involves the use of encryption or encoding to protect the content of files. However, the question specifically mentions communication with an IP address, not files.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves the use of phishing to obtain sensitive information. Since the question is about C2 communication, this is not the most relevant technique.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain C2 communications. This directly addresses the need for secure and potentially undetectable communication with an IP address.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs for maintaining C2 communication with an IP address, given the context of the question, is the use of an encrypted channel to ensure the communication remains secure and potentially undetectable.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
