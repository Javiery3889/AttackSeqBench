To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for hiding the 'mothership' control server's location in the 'Red October' campaign, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line shells or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly address the issue of hiding the location of the C&C server.

2. **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This can be used for persistence and evasion but does not directly hide the location of the C&C server.

3. **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names at runtime, which can be used to evade static domain blacklisting and DNS-based detection. By using techniques like DNS tunneling or domain generation algorithms (DGAs), the C&C server's location can be obfuscated, making it harder to track and block.

4. **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**: This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols to distribute data or commands. While it can be used for communication, it does not directly address the issue of hiding the location of the C&C server.

Given the context of the 'Red October' campaign, which involved sophisticated methods to maintain stealth and evade detection, the most plausible technique for hiding the 'mothership' control server's location would be one that can dynamically change the server's address, making it difficult to track.

**Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
