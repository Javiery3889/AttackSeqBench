Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance.
     - Compromised domain credentials.
     - Access to shared folders over SMB.
   - The question asks about the lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
     - This technique involves using cloud accounts for lateral movement. The question does not mention cloud accounts, so this is unlikely.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's identity, which is more about reconnaissance rather than lateral movement.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold on a system. It can include accessing shared folders over SMB, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - Similar to T1087.004, this technique involves using cloud services for lateral movement, which is not relevant to the question.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the lateral movement between IIS servers, which is a form of remote service.
   - The use of compromised domain credentials and access to shared folders over SMB are consistent with the T1021 technique.
   - T1021.007 is not relevant as it pertains to cloud services, and T1589 and T1087.004 are more about reconnaissance and cloud accounts, respectively.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs for the lateral movement between IIS servers is T1021-Remote Services.

Final Answer: C
