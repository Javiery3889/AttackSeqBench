To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
- **Obfuscated .NET Loaders (T1553.003)**: This technique involves using .NET assemblies to load and execute malicious code, often obfuscated to evade detection.
- **CppHostCLR**: This is a specific technique where the .NET assembly is loaded into the CLR (Common Language Runtime) and then used to execute the payload in memory.
- **In-memory decryption and execution**: The payload is decrypted and executed in memory, which is a common technique to avoid leaving traces on the disk and evade traditional antivirus solutions.
- **QuasarRAT backdoor**: This is a specific type of malware that provides remote access to the compromised system.

### Answer Choices:
A. **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves compromising the trust relationships between systems, which is not directly related to the in-memory execution of a backdoor.
B. **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to facilitate the execution of malicious code. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the in-memory execution of the payload.
C. **T1059.011-Lua**: This technique involves the use of Lua scripts for execution. However, the question specifies .NET loaders and in-memory execution, which does not align with Lua.
D. **T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves the use of chat messages to exfiltrate data or deliver commands. Given that the payload is a backdoor (QuasarRAT), it is likely that the attackers would use chat messages to communicate with the compromised system and control the backdoor.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Obfuscation and In-memory Execution**: The question describes the use of obfuscated .NET loaders and in-memory execution, which aligns with T1553.003.
2. **Execution of QuasarRAT**: The payload is a backdoor (QuasarRAT), which is a form of remote access tool.
3. **Communication with the Compromised System**: Given the nature of a backdoor, it is highly likely that the attackers would use some form of communication to control the backdoor, which aligns with T1552.008 (Chat Messages).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
