Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: decoding and executing a base64 encoded PowerShell script from a file named 'sdmc.jpg'.
   - The goal is to identify which ATT&CK technique was used to hinder detection and conceal the malicious components before moving to the command and control phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path:** This technique involves modifying the system's PATH environment variable to intercept and execute malicious code. However, the question does not mention any changes to the PATH variable or interception of paths.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves encoding or encrypting files or information to make them less detectable. The question mentions a base64 encoded PowerShell script, which is a form of obfuscation.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control server. While this is a common technique for hiding C2 traffic, the question is specifically about hiding the malicious components before the C2 phase.
   - **D: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect network traffic. This is not related to hiding or obfuscating the malicious components.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the PowerShell script was base64 encoded, which is a form of obfuscation.
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information directly corresponds to the use of base64 encoding to hide the malicious script.
   - The other techniques (Path Interception, Encrypted Channel, and ARP Cache Poisoning) do not align with the specific action of encoding the script.

**Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
