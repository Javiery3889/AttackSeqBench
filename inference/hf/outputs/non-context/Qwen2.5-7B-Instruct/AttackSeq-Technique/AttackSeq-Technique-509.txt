Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign used a SombRAT backdoor.
   - The backdoor archived collected data in a custom storage file format.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK technique for transferring this data from the victim's system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using a USB device. Given that the data is stored in a custom format and not directly exfiltrated via a USB, this is unlikely.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to evade detection. It does not pertain to data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1590.001-Domain Properties:** This technique involves modifying domain properties to evade detection. It is not related to data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Given that the SombRAT backdoor is likely communicating with a C2 server, this is the most plausible method for transferring the data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The SombRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor is known to use a C2 channel for communication.
   - The data is stored in a custom format, which suggests it is being prepared for exfiltration.
   - The most logical and common method for transferring data from a compromised system to a C2 server is through a C2 channel.
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique for transferring the data is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

**Final Answer: D**
