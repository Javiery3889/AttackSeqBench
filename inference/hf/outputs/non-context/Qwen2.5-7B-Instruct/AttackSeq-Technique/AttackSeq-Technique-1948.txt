Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers first gain execution through DLL side-loading techniques and then create persistence mechanisms using a Service + Run Key.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique allowed the attackers to implant the PlugX RAT in the target's system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves gaining execution and then creating persistence.
   - DLL side-loading is a technique used to gain execution.
   - Persistence is achieved through a Service + Run Key.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a social engineering technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. It does not directly relate to DLL side-loading or persistence mechanisms.
   - **B: T1134.002-Create Process with Token**
     - This technique involves creating a process with a token that has elevated privileges. While it can be used to gain execution, it does not directly relate to DLL side-loading.
   - **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts. It is not directly related to DLL side-loading or persistence mechanisms.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves placing files in directories that are processed by the operating system during boot or logon, such as the Windows Startup folder or the Run registry key. This aligns with the sequence of gaining execution and then creating persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the attackers first gain execution through DLL side-loading.
   - After gaining execution, they create persistence using a Service + Run Key.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (D) directly relates to the creation of persistence mechanisms like placing files in the Startup folder or Run registry key.

**Final Answer: D**
