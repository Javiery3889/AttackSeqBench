Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Volatile Cedar uses keylogging to gain credentials.
   - It then states that the campaign connects with multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Keylogging to gain credentials (TTP related to credential access).
   - Connecting to multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems (TTP related to command and control).

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it doesn't directly relate to the connection to backend frameworks.
   - **B: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system to ensure it is in the desired state. It doesn't directly relate to the connection to backend frameworks.
   - **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves obfuscating data to avoid detection. It doesn't directly relate to the connection to backend frameworks.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the command and control server. This aligns well with the description of connecting to multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: D
