Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Adversaries used BlackEnergy 3 plugins.
   - Conducted credential harvesting.
   - Conducted network discovery to identify targets within corporate networks.
   - Enumerated all networked devices on the ICS network.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves actively probing a network to identify open ports and services. While it could be part of the overall attack sequence, it is not directly related to the enumeration of networked devices on an ICS network.
   - **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the network discovery and enumeration of networked devices on the ICS network.
   - **C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance**
     - This technique involves running a virtual machine or container to execute malicious code. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **D: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
     - This technique involves compromising a cloud account, which is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs focused on an ICS network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves identifying and enumerating networked devices on an ICS network. The most relevant technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework for this is T1018-Remote System Discovery, as it directly pertains to discovering and gathering information about remote systems, which aligns with the enumeration of networked devices.

**Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
