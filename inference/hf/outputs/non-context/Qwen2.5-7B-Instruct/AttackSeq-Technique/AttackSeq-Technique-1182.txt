Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The backdoor has already collected machine information and screenshots and sent them to a C&C server.
   - The next step involves querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned are related to querying external services and transmitting data, likely in an encrypted manner.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it doesn't directly relate to querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.
   - **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive. It doesn't align with the described TTPs of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service to communicate with a remote server. This aligns well with the described TTPs as it involves querying external services and could be used for transmitting encrypted messages.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. It doesn't fit the described TTPs of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1102-Web Service, as it directly involves querying external services and could be used for transmitting encrypted messages.

Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
