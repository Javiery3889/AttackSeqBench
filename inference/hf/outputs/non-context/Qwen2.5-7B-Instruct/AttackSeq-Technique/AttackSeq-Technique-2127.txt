Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs starts with scanning tools and stolen credentials for discovery.
   - The next step is the deployment of RDP to target servers, which is a form of lateral movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Discovery: Scanning tools and stolen credentials.
   - Lateral Movement: Deployment of RDP to target servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**
     - This technique involves collecting email content from remote systems. It does not align with the sequence of TTPs described, as it is not a method of lateral movement.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command shells or scripting interpreters to execute commands on a remote system. While it can be used for discovery and lateral movement, it is not specifically about deploying RDP.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to establish a connection to a remote system. Deploying RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to target servers is a specific instance of using remote services.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services to establish a connection to a remote system. It is not directly related to the deployment of RDP to target servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where scanning and credential theft are used for discovery, followed by the deployment of RDP for lateral movement.
   - Among the given choices, T1021-Remote Services (C) is the most relevant because it encompasses the use of remote services, which includes RDP.
   - T1021.007-Cloud Services (D) is not relevant as it specifically refers to cloud services, not RDP.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (B) is a broader technique that could be used for both discovery and lateral movement but does not specifically mention RDP.
   - T1114.002-Remote Email Collection (A) is not relevant to the sequence of TTPs described.

5. **Final Answer:**
   Final Answer: C
