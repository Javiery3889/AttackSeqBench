To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host.**
2. **The next step is to collect files, keystrokes, and screenshots from the victim's system.**

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**
- This technique involves intercepting or bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms. It does not directly relate to the collection of files, keystrokes, or screenshots.

**B: T1056-Input Capture**
- This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with collecting keystrokes. However, it does not cover the collection of files and screenshots.

**C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
- This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. While it is related to data collection, it is more about the exfiltration process rather than the collection itself.

**D: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**
- This technique involves using stolen hashes to authenticate as a user on the network. It does not directly relate to the collection of files, keystrokes, or screenshots.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurs after executing arbitrary code and before collecting files, keystrokes, and screenshots is **T1056-Input Capture**. This is because T1056 specifically deals with capturing user input, which aligns with collecting keystrokes.

**Final Answer: B**
