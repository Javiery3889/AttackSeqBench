To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack started with a weaponized link directing the user to a .wsc file. This is a form of initial access, but it does not specify the technique used to achieve this.

2. **Redirection and Fileless Implementation**: The question states that after the initial access, the attack utilized redirections and fileless implementations of legitimate tools to evade defenses. This suggests that the attackers were looking to hide their malicious activities and avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**: This technique involves an attacker setting up a rogue domain controller to perform actions such as modifying user accounts or stealing credentials. While this could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly relate to the redirection and fileless implementation mentioned in the question.

B. **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or misrepresenting indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While this could be a part of the attack, it does not directly address the redirection and fileless implementation of legitimate tools.

C. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. This could be a method to implement fileless attacks, as it allows for the execution of code without writing files to disk. This aligns well with the redirection and fileless implementation mentioned in the question.

D. **T1559.001-Component Object Model**: This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code. While this can be used for fileless execution, it is more specific to the use of COM objects and does not directly address the redirection and fileless implementation of legitimate tools.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the redirection and fileless implementation of legitimate tools is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

Final Answer: C
