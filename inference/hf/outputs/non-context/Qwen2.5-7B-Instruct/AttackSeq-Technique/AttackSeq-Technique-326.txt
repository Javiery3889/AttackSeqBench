Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor is used to inject additional modules into device memory for execution.
   - After this, infected devices connect to C2 servers to ensure they remain part of the botnet.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is the use of a backdoor to inject additional modules into device memory.
   - The second TTP is the connection to C2 servers to maintain the botnet.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**
     - This technique involves renaming system utilities to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the connection to C2 servers.
   - **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. It is more about altering the execution flow rather than connecting to C2 servers.
   - **C: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting file permissions to execute malicious code. It is also more about the execution of code rather than the connection to C2 servers.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. While it is related to the injection of modules, it does not directly address the connection to C2 servers.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question is asking for the technique that ensures infected devices remain part of the botnet after connecting to C2 servers. This implies a technique that is more about maintaining the connection and control over the infected devices.
   - The most relevant technique in this context is T1091 (Proxy or Gateway for C2 Traffic), which is not listed in the choices. However, the closest and most plausible technique from the given choices is T1136 (Proxy or Gateway for C2 Traffic), which is not listed but is implied by the need to maintain the connection to C2 servers.

Given the choices provided, none directly match T1136, but the closest in nature to maintaining the connection to C2 servers is not listed. However, if we consider the context and the need to maintain the connection, the most plausible choice would be a technique that ensures the persistence and control over the infected devices, which is not directly listed but implied by the need to connect to C2 servers.

**Final Answer: None of the provided choices directly match the context of maintaining the connection to C2 servers. However, if we must choose the closest, it would be D: T1129-Shared Modules, as it is related to the execution of code, which is a necessary step before connecting to C2 servers.** 

Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules
