Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions a malicious Word document containing VBA-Macro functions, which is a form of social engineering to execute code.
   - The next step is obfuscating a JavaScript payload to hinder analysis.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls:** This technique involves compromising a trusted system or control to gain an advantage. It doesn't directly relate to the use of a malicious Word document or obfuscating a JavaScript payload.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using deceptive communication to lure victims into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. While it could be related to the initial malicious Word document, it doesn't directly follow the execution of code.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it could be related to executing the JavaScript payload, it doesn't specifically address the obfuscation step.
   - **D: T1053.002-At:** This choice seems incomplete and does not provide a full ATT&CK technique identifier.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence would be the use of a malicious Word document (which could be a form of T1566-Phishing) to execute code, followed by obfuscating a JavaScript payload to hinder analysis. The technique that best fits the obfuscation of the JavaScript payload is likely to be a technique that involves modifying or encoding the payload to avoid detection.

Given the options, the most plausible sequence is not directly provided in the choices, but the closest fit for the obfuscation step would be a technique that involves encoding or modifying the payload, which is not directly listed in the choices. However, if we must choose the most relevant one, T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter could be the closest, as it involves executing scripts, which could include obfuscation.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
