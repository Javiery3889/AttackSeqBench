Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack started with socially engineered emails containing password-protected Office files. This aligns with the initial access phase.

2. **LURK Malware**: The question states that LURK malware maintained defense evasion by utilizing obfuscated files or information. This indicates that after gaining initial access, the malware was used to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: We need to identify which technique occurred before the malware's obfuscation method. The obfuscation technique (T1027) is a method used by the malware to evade detection, so it must occur after the malware has been deployed.

4. **Evaluating Each Option**:
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves running code in the boot process or at logon to ensure persistence. While it is a method of maintaining persistence, it does not directly relate to the obfuscation of files or information.
   - **B: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a running process. It is a method of execution but does not directly relate to the obfuscation of files or information.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique directly involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. Since the question states that the malware utilized this technique, it must occur after the malware has been deployed.
   - **D: T1558.003-Kerberoasting**: This technique involves stealing Kerberos tickets to gain access to service accounts. While it is a method of lateral movement, it does not directly relate to the obfuscation of files or information.

5. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access (socially engineered emails with password-protected Office files), the malware is deployed, and then it uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
