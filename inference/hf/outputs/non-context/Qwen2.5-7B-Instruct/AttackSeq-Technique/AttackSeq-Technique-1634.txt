To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **SUNSPOT Malware and AES128-CBC Encryption**: This indicates that the malware is using encryption to protect its payload or the targeted files. This is a form of data protection and is not directly related to the TTPs listed in the answer choices.

2. **Monitoring Running Processes to Detect MsBuild.exe**: This suggests that the malware is looking for specific processes, which is a common technique used in the discovery phase to identify and potentially interact with legitimate tools that might be used by the defenders.

3. **Identifying the Preceding TTP**: We need to find a TTP that logically precedes the monitoring of running processes. The TTP should be one that would enable the malware to establish persistence or maintain access, which would then allow it to monitor processes.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: This technique involves embedding malicious content in HTML documents. It is not directly related to monitoring processes or establishing persistence.

B. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding or obfuscating the malware's presence. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly lead to the monitoring of processes.

C. **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**: This technique involves capturing web traffic to steal credentials or other sensitive information. It is not directly related to monitoring processes.

D. **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run the malware at a later time. This would allow the malware to establish persistence and then monitor processes, making it a logical step before the monitoring phase.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that the malware first establishes persistence (T1053) and then monitors running processes to detect MsBuild.exe.

**Final Answer: D**
