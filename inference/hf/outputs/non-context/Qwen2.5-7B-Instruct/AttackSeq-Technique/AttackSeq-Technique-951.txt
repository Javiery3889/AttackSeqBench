Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the malware has already staged data by scanning for files with specific extensions and creating a file containing paths of all files to exfiltrate. This is part of the Collection phase.
   - The next step involves communication with a C&C server over ports 80 or 443, which is likely for command and control or further instructions.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1543.001-Launch Agent** - This technique involves the use of a launch agent to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to exfiltration or communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not related to the described data collection and exfiltration process.
   - **C: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage** - This technique involves exfiltrating data to a cloud storage service. While it is related to exfiltration, it does not specifically mention communication with a C&C server.
   - **D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** - This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data to an external server. It is more general and does not specify the method of communication, but it is the closest to the described process of exfiltrating data after communication with a C&C server.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the malware communicated with the C&C server over ports 80 or 443. This implies that the exfiltration is likely to be automated and possibly through a web-based service, which aligns with the T1020 technique.
   - T1567.002 (Exfiltration to Cloud Storage) is more specific to cloud storage and does not necessarily involve communication with a C&C server.
   - T1113 (Screen Capture) and T1543.001 (Launch Agent) are not related to the described exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
