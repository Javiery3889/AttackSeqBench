To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Social Engineering and Spear Phishing**: These are initial techniques used to gain initial access and obtain credentials.
2. **Credential Access**: This is the next step after gaining access through social engineering and spear phishing.
3. **Suspicious String Obfuscation and Harder to Detect API Calls**: These are techniques used to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1622-Debugger Evasion**: This technique is used to prevent the attacker from being detected by a debugger. It is more likely to be used after gaining access and maintaining persistence, not before.

B. **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which is not directly related to the initial access or credential access phases. It is more relevant to data exfiltration or command and control activities.

C. **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique is used to perform network-level attacks, such as poisoning network protocols to redirect traffic. It is more likely to be used to gain initial access or maintain persistence, but it is not directly related to the credential access phase.

D. **T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**: This technique involves clearing event logs to avoid detection. It is more likely to be used after gaining access and maintaining persistence, not before.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible technique that would occur before the suspicious string obfuscation and harder to detect API calls is one that helps in gaining initial access or maintaining it without being detected. Among the choices, **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay** (C) is the most relevant as it can help in gaining initial access or maintaining persistence by redirecting traffic, which can be a precursor to more sophisticated techniques like obfuscation and harder to detect API calls.

Final Answer: C
