To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Gaining Credentials Using Mimikatz**: This is a clear indication of the T1107 technique, which involves the use of a tool to extract credentials from memory.

2. **Mapping the Network**: This step involves identifying and enumerating network resources, which aligns with the T1046 technique (Network Service Discovery).

3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities to Discover Further Systems**: This step involves using the credentials obtained to exploit vulnerabilities and discover additional systems, which aligns with the T1218 technique (Exploitation for Lateral Movement).

Given the sequence of events, the question asks which technique most likely occurred before the network was mapped and further systems were discovered. The mapping of the network (T1046) and the exploitation of vulnerabilities (T1218) are subsequent steps after gaining credentials.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique is about mapping the network, which happens after the credentials are obtained.
- **B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**: This technique is not a standard ATT&CK technique. The correct technique for exploiting credentials is T1107.
- **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
- **D: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion**: This technique involves delaying detection by the adversary, which is not relevant to the sequence described.

The most plausible technique that would occur before mapping the network and exploiting vulnerabilities is the technique used to gain the initial credentials. The correct technique for this is T1107 (Gather Credentials).

However, since T1107 is not among the choices, the closest and most relevant technique in the provided list is T1046, which is the first step in the sequence after gaining credentials.

Final Answer: A: T1046-Network Service Discovery
