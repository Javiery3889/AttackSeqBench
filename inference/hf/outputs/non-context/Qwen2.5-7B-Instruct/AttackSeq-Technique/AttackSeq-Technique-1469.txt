Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
   - It then mentions the use of GitHub gists for discovery.
   - The question asks which technique was used to ensure the SLUB backdoor remained active upon system startup.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
     - This technique is not directly related to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup. It is more about adding an additional layer of security.
   - **B: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
     - This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load a malicious DLL at system startup. This could be a plausible method to ensure a backdoor remains active.
   - **C: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not related to ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves placing malware in locations that are executed during system boot or logon. This is a direct method to ensure a backdoor remains active upon system startup.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Both T1546.010-AppInit DLLs and T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution are valid techniques for ensuring a backdoor remains active upon system startup.
   - However, T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is a more general and commonly used technique for this purpose, as it encompasses various methods of ensuring malware is executed at boot or logon, including AppInit DLLs.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
