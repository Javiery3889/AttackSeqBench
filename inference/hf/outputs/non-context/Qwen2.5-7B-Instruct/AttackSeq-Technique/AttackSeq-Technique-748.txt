To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Tortoiseshell used their malware to confirm Google was reachable.**
   - This suggests the malware is checking for a network connection or a specific service (Google) to ensure it can communicate with the command and control (C2) server or to validate the network environment.

2. **Ensuring it could bypass network-based defenses.**
   - This implies the malware is performing some form of evasion to avoid detection by network security measures.

3. **Before the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed system information.**
   - This indicates that the next step in the sequence is reconnaissance, where the malware is gathering information about the target system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
   - This technique involves using a phishing attack to gain access to a system. However, the question does not mention any phishing activity, and the malware is already confirmed to be active and checking network reachability.

B. **T1566-Phishing**
   - Similar to T1534, this technique involves phishing. Again, there is no indication of phishing in the sequence described.

C. **T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
   - This technique involves stealing or misusing access tokens to gain elevated privileges. While this could be a step in the attack chain, it does not directly relate to the network reachability check or the reconnaissance phase.

D. **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
   - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. Given that the malware is confirming network reachability and ensuring it can bypass network-based defenses, this technique fits well as it aligns with the need to avoid detection by security tools.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible TTP that occurs after confirming network reachability and before system reconnaissance is T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.

Final Answer: D
