To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the sequence of techniques involved:

1. **Encrypted Configuration Files for Defense Evasion**: This suggests that the attackers are trying to avoid detection by using encrypted files, which is a common tactic to evade security measures.

2. **Compromised Privileged Accounts for Lateral Movement**: This indicates that the attackers have gained access to high-level accounts to move laterally within the network, which is a step taken after initial compromise and evasion.

3. **Collection of Information Related to the Target's System Details**: This is the step that precedes the use of compromised privileged accounts and encrypted configuration files. The attackers need to gather information about the target's system to understand the environment and identify valuable accounts or systems to target.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices connected to the target system. While it can provide some information, it is not the most direct or common method for gathering system details.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information. It is not directly related to the collection of system details.

- **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target system, such as the operating system, network topology, and other system details. This is a direct and common method for attackers to understand the target environment before moving further.

- **D: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts. While it can be part of the attack chain, it is more about creating access rather than gathering information.

Given the sequence and the need to gather system details before using compromised privileged accounts and encrypted configuration files, the most plausible technique is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

Final Answer: C
