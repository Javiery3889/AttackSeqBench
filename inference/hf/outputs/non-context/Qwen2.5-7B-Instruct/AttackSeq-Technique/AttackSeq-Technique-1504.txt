Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Iron group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Checking for VM execution during the installation process.
     2. Using a hardcoded shellcode to load a Cobalt Strike beacon in-memory through a reflective loader.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service to deliver malware. It does not fit the sequence as it is not related to checking for VM execution or loading a beacon in-memory.
   - **T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It is not related to the described sequence.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** This technique involves evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. It fits the context of checking for VM execution.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (repeated):** This is the same as the previous choice and is redundant.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1102-Web Service:** Does not fit the sequence.
   - **T1197-BITS Jobs:** Does not fit the sequence.
   - **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion:** Fits the context of checking for VM execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The technique that most likely occurred after the malware installer checked for VM execution is T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.

Final Answer: D
