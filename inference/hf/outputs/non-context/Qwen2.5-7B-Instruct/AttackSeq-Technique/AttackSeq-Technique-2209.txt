To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
- **Earth Lusca** engaged in lateral movement.
- Exploited remote services.
- Used tools like `lcx` and `frp` to establish network tunnels.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Lateral Movement**: This is the initial step where the adversary moves from one system to another within the same network. The question does not specify the exact technique used for lateral movement, but it is mentioned that it involved exploiting remote services.

2. **Exploiting Remote Services**: This indicates that the adversary used a vulnerability or misconfiguration in remote services to gain access to other systems.

3. **Establishing Network Tunnels**: The use of `lcx` and `frp` suggests that the adversary created encrypted tunnels to maintain persistence and stealth. `lcx` is a tool for creating encrypted tunnels, and `frp` is a tool for port forwarding and reverse proxying.

### Evaluating the Answer Choices:

- **A: T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting a weakness in file permissions to install an executable. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly follow the described lateral movement and tunnel establishment.

- **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive. While this could be a step after establishing network tunnels, it does not directly follow the described lateral movement and tunnel establishment.

- **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network services. While this could be a step before lateral movement, it does not directly follow the described lateral movement and tunnel establishment.

- **D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**: This technique involves poisoning the LLMNR/NBT-NS protocol to redirect traffic to a malicious server and using SMB relay to gain access to systems. This technique aligns well with the described lateral movement and tunnel establishment, as it involves exploiting network protocols to gain access to other systems and maintain persistence.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the described scenario, is the use of `T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay` to further the attack after the initial lateral movement and tunnel establishment.

**Final Answer: D**
