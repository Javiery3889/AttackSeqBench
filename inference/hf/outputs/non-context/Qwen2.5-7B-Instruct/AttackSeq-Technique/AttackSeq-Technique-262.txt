To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The Hellsing APT group sent a backdoor disguised as a document error message.
   - The backdoor then connected to a command server at philippinenews[.]mooo[.]com.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547.001-Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**
     - This technique involves adding a malicious entry to the registry or startup folder to ensure persistence. However, it doesn't directly relate to the initial delivery of the backdoor disguised as a document error message.
   - **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly explain how the backdoor was initially delivered.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using social engineering to trick the user into executing a malicious payload. The question states that the backdoor was disguised as a document error message, which is a common phishing tactic.
   - **D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves using remote access software to gain access to a system. While this could be part of the post-exploitation phase, it doesn't directly explain the initial delivery of the backdoor.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor was disguised as a document error message, which is a form of social engineering.
   - The most plausible technique that aligns with this initial delivery method is T1566-Phishing, as it involves using social engineering to trick the user into executing a malicious payload.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
