To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers and utilized methods such as `DownloadString` and `DownloadData` to request and download payloads, let's analyze each option in the context of the described sequence of TTPs.

1. **T1090.001-Internal Proxy (A)**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While it could be a method to bypass network security measures, it does not directly relate to the initial steps of downloading payloads via `DownloadString` and `DownloadData`.

2. **T1078-Valid Accounts (B)**: This technique involves the use of valid user accounts to gain access to systems. While this could be a method to establish initial access, it does not directly relate to the process of downloading payloads via `DownloadString` and `DownloadData`.

3. **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (C)**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. This could be a plausible step before downloading payloads, as it involves the initial transfer of malicious tools or scripts into the target environment, which could then be used to download additional payloads.

4. **T1027.003-Steganography (D)**: This technique involves hiding data within other data. While it could be a method to exfiltrate or transfer data, it does not directly relate to the initial steps of downloading payloads via `DownloadString` and `DownloadData`.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the initial transfer of tools or scripts into the target environment, which can then be used to download additional payloads. Therefore, the technique that best fits this description is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

**Final Answer: C**
