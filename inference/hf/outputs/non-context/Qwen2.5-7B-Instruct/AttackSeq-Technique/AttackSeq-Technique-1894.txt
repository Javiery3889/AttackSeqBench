To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Initial TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that FIN13 utilized lateral movement methods such as WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. These are techniques used to move laterally within a network to access additional systems.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging** - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to steal sensitive information. While it is a common post-exploitation technique, it is not directly related to the lateral movement described.
   - **B: T1123-Audio Capture** - This technique involves capturing audio from a system. It is not relevant to the lateral movement described.
   - **C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which is a plausible next step after gaining access to additional systems through lateral movement. It aligns well with the use of custom web shells (BUSTEDPIPE) mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive** - This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive. While it is a post-exploitation technique, it is not as directly related to the use of web shells and WMI for lateral movement as T1567.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes the use of WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - After gaining access to additional systems, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate data, which is a common goal of cyber attackers.
   - T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service (Choice C) directly aligns with the use of web shells for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
