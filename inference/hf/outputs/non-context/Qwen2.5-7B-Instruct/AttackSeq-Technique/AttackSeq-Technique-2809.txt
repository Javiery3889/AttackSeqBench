To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The question mentions that the attacker created a `.LNK` file in the Windows startup directory. This is a common method for persistence and is associated with the ATT&CK technique **T1055.002 - Create or Modify System Startup Object**.

2. **Hooking APIs and Registering a Binary**: The next step described is that Grandoreiro hooked APIs and registered a binary as the default handler for `.MSC` files. This is a method to gain elevated privileges and is associated with the ATT&CK technique **T1548.001 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**.

3. **Identifying the Preceding TTP**: The question asks which technique most likely occurred before the API hooking and binary registration. We need to find a technique that would precede these actions and enable the attacker to perform them.

- **A: T1055.013 - Process Doppelg√§nging**: This technique involves creating a process that mimics another process to evade detection. While it can be used for persistence, it does not directly enable the hooking of APIs or registering a binary as a default handler.
  
- **B: T1548.001 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique is about gaining elevated privileges, which is the goal after the API hooking and binary registration. It does not precede these actions.
  
- **C: T1518 - Software Discovery**: This technique involves discovering software on the system, which could be a precursor to understanding the system's environment and identifying potential targets for persistence and privilege escalation. However, it is not directly related to the specific actions of hooking APIs or registering a binary.
  
- **D: T1546.007 - Netsh Helper DLL**: This technique involves using the `netsh` command to register a helper DLL, which can be used to gain elevated privileges. This is a plausible technique that could precede the API hooking and binary registration, as it would enable the attacker to perform actions with elevated privileges.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **T1546.007 - Netsh Helper DLL** would occur before the API hooking and binary registration.

Final Answer: D
