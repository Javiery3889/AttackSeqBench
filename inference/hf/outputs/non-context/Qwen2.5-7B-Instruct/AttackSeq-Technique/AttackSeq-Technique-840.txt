To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - Executing WinDealer malware
     - Configuring the malware by reading a configuration file
     - Loading a DLL module
     - Discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware execution and configuration are part of the initial stages of the attack.
   - The next step is the discovery of information about the infected PC and network configuration, which is a form of reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to mask the attacker's IP address. It is not directly related to the discovery of information about the infected PC and network configuration.
   - **B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique is about evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to the discovery of information about the infected PC and network configuration.
   - **C: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves making the malware appear as legitimate software to evade detection. It is not directly related to the discovery of information about the infected PC and network configuration.
   - **D: T1518-Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating software on the target system. This aligns well with the step where the malware discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has been executed and configured.
   - The next logical step is to gather information about the system and network, which is best described by the T1518-Software Discovery technique.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: D
