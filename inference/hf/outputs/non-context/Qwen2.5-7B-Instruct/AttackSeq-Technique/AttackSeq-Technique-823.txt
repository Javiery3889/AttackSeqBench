Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where targeted individuals are organized using campaign codes, credentials are stolen, and the stolen credentials are transmitted to C2 servers.
   - The specific TTP mentioned is that FIN4 captured user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

2. **Identify the Relevant ATT&CK Techniques:**
   - **T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which could be relevant if the VBA macros were designed to capture keystrokes or other user inputs.
   - **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to redirect emails to a C2 server, which is not directly related to the credential capture through VBA macros.
   - **T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the credential capture through VBA macros.
   - **T1528-Steal Application Access Token:** This technique involves stealing access tokens from applications, which is not directly related to the credential capture through VBA macros.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1528-Steal Application Access Token:** This technique is not directly related to capturing credentials through VBA macros.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique could be relevant if the VBA macros were designed to capture user inputs, such as keystrokes or other data that could be used to steal credentials.
   - **C: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule:** This technique is not directly related to the credential capture through VBA macros.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique is not directly related to the credential capture through VBA macros.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the VBA macros were designed to capture user inputs, which aligns with the T1056-Input Capture technique.

Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture
