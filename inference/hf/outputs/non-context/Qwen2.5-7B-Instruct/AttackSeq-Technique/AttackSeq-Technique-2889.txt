To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Discovery Techniques**: The question mentions querying registry values and manipulating thread contexts. These actions are typically associated with reconnaissance and initial access techniques, which are part of the initial attack phase.

2. **Establishing Communication**: The question then asks about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols. This indicates that the attacker is looking to maintain or establish a covert channel for data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communications.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic through a third-party server. While this can be used for communication, it does not directly relate to the specific mention of HTTP and HTTPS protocols in the question.

B. **T1498-Network Denial of Service**: This technique is about disrupting network services, which is not relevant to the question as it does not pertain to establishing communication.

C. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for C2 or data exfiltration. This directly aligns with the question's mention of using HTTP and HTTPS for communication.

D. **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions within the target environment. While this might be part of the initial access or execution phase, it does not directly relate to the communication aspect mentioned in the question.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the question's description of establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols is:

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
