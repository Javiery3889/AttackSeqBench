Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The backdoor has established an active connection with C2 servers.
   - It enables the remote installation of new apps or code.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitates the threat actors' ability to evade detection and maintain a legitimate appearance during operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception** - This technique involves intercepting or bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms. While it can be used to gain unauthorized access, it does not directly help in evading detection or maintaining a legitimate appearance.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts** - This technique involves using valid credentials to gain access to systems. This can help in maintaining a legitimate appearance and evading detection by appearing as a legitimate user.
   - **C: T1584.002-DNS Server** - This technique involves modifying DNS records to redirect traffic. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly help in maintaining a legitimate appearance.
   - **D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution** - This technique involves executing commands through an intermediary to avoid detection. While it can help in evading detection, it does not directly help in maintaining a legitimate appearance.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question emphasizes the need to evade detection and maintain a legitimate appearance.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts** is the most relevant because using valid accounts can help the threat actors appear as legitimate users, thereby evading detection. This technique is commonly used to maintain persistence and avoid raising alarms.

**Final Answer: B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
