Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Elise malware uses defense evasion techniques and communicates with a hardcoded C2 server.
   - The next step in the sequence is the harvesting of extensive system information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Defense evasion (likely T1072 or another relevant technique).
   - Communication with a hardcoded C2 server (likely T1071 or another relevant technique).
   - Harvesting of system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying files and directories on the system, which is a form of information gathering but not necessarily the most comprehensive system information harvesting.
   - **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering network configuration details, which is also a form of information gathering but more specific to network configurations.
   - **C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
     - This technique is not directly related to information gathering or system information harvesting. It is more about manipulating file attributes.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server, which is already mentioned in the question. It does not directly relate to harvesting system information.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question is asking for the technique that most likely occurs after the malware has already employed defense evasion and communicated with a C2 server. The next step is to gather comprehensive system information.
   - T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) and T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) are both forms of information gathering, but T1083 is more general and could encompass a broader range of system information, including files, directories, and potentially other system details.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1083-File and Directory Discovery, as it aligns best with the harvesting of extensive system information.

Final Answer: A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
