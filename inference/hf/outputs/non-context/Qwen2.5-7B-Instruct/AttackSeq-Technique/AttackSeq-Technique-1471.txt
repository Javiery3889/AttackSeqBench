To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of TTPs and evaluate each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Discovery by retrieving a gist snippet from GitHub to parse commands and gather system information:**
   - This indicates reconnaissance and initial information gathering, which aligns with the T1083 - Reconnaissance technique.

2. **Use of SLUB backdoor to collect data from the victim's system:**
   - The SLUB backdoor is a specific type of backdoor used to gain persistent access and control over a victim's system. This is more aligned with the T1578.003 - Backdoor technique.

Given the context of using a backdoor to collect data, we need to determine which of the provided answer choices best fits the scenario of data collection and possibly further actions that might be taken after gaining access.

**Answer Choices Analysis:**

A. **T1056.004-Credential API Hooking:**
   - This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to capture credentials. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly align with the use of a backdoor to collect data.

B. **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:**
   - This technique involves poisoning network protocols to redirect traffic. It is more about network manipulation rather than data collection from a backdoor.

C. **T1562-Impair Defenses:**
   - This technique involves actions to prevent the victim from detecting or responding to the attack. While it can be part of an overall strategy, it does not directly align with the use of a backdoor to collect data.

D. **T1113-Screen Capture:**
   - This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. While it can be a method to collect data, it is more specific and less likely to be the primary technique used after gaining access via a backdoor.

Given the context of using a backdoor to collect data, the most plausible technique is one that directly involves data collection. Among the choices, T1578.003 - Backdoor is the most relevant, but it is not listed. The closest and most plausible technique from the given choices is T1113-Screen Capture, as it directly involves collecting data (screenshots) from the victim's system.

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
