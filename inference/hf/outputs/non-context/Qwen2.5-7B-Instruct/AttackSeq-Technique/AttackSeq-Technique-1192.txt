To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **Download of Malicious Payloads via Nefarious Macros**: This indicates that the initial attack vector was through macros that were used to download and execute malicious payloads.

2. **RMS Executable Maintaining Contact with Threat Actor's Infrastructure**: This suggests that the malware (RMS executable) is performing some form of communication or maintaining persistence to allow the threat actor to control or exfiltrate data from the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1665-Hide Infrastructure**: This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used by the attacker, such as C2 servers, to avoid detection. While this is a valid technique, it does not directly address the maintenance of contact or communication with the threat actor's infrastructure.

B. **T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves the use of JavaScript to execute code. While JavaScript can be used for various malicious activities, it does not directly relate to maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

C. **T1219-Remote Access Software**: This technique involves the use of remote access software to maintain access to the target system. This is a strong candidate as it directly addresses the need for the RMS executable to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

D. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. While this is an initial attack vector, it does not address the maintenance of contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the RMS executable uses remote access software to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

**Final Answer: C**
