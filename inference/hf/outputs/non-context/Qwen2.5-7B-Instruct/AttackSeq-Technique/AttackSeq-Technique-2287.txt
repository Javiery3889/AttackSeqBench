To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Identify the TTPs in the Question:**
   - The question mentions Regin's capability to capture screenshots, control the mouse's point-and-click functions, and retrieve credential information. These actions are indicative of techniques that allow for monitoring and controlling user interactions and system processes.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL:** This technique involves filtering password hashes from memory. While it is related to credential information, it does not directly address the actions of capturing screenshots or controlling the mouse.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves executing code in the context of a user. While it can be used to gain execution rights, it does not directly address the specific actions of capturing screenshots or controlling the mouse.
   - **C: T1560.002-Archive via Library:** This technique involves archiving data using a library. It is not directly related to the actions of capturing screenshots or controlling the mouse.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the actions of controlling the mouse's point-and-click functions and potentially capturing screenshots. It is a more direct match for the described TTPs.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes actions that are closely related to user interaction and system monitoring.
   - T1056-Input Capture (D) is specifically designed to capture user input, which directly aligns with the ability to control the mouse and capture screenshots.
   - The other techniques (A, B, and C) do not directly address the specific actions mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
