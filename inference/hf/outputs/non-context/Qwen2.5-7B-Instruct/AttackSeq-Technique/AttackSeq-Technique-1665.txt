Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware gathers victim system information (T1027.001).
   - Bidirectional communication with C2 servers using HTTPS (T1071-Application Layer Protocol).
   - HTTPS is encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**:
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 traffic. While it can be used in conjunction with T1071, it does not directly describe the use of HTTPS or the specific encryption and encoding methods mentioned.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**:
     - This technique specifically mentions the use of application layer protocols like HTTPS for C2 communication. It aligns well with the description of bidirectional communication using HTTPS.
   - **C: T1546.009-AppCert DLLs**:
     - This technique involves using legitimate application certificates to sign malicious DLLs. It does not relate to the use of HTTPS or the specific encryption and encoding methods mentioned.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**:
     - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions on the system. It does not directly relate to the use of HTTPS or the specific encryption and encoding methods mentioned.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly addresses the use of HTTPS for C2 communication.

Final Answer: B
