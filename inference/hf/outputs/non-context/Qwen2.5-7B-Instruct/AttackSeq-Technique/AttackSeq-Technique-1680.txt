To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the WastedLocker attack infrastructure, let's analyze the provided answer choices in the context of the attack's end goal of significant disruption to the victim's IT infrastructure.

1. **Cobalt Strike Beacon Communicating with C&C Domain (T1071.001 - Remote Services - Beacon):**
   - This is the initial step where the malware establishes a connection with the C&C server to receive further instructions.

2. **Identifying the End Goal:**
   - The end goal is significant disruption to the victim's IT infrastructure, which typically involves either data destruction, data encryption, or credential dumping to gain further access.

3. **Evaluating Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547.015-Login Items:** This technique involves adding malicious login items to a user's system. While it can provide persistence, it does not directly lead to significant disruption of the IT infrastructure.
   - **B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to render it unusable, which aligns with the goal of significant disruption. Encrypting critical data can severely impact the victim's operations.
   - **C: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves deleting or corrupting data, which also aligns with the goal of significant disruption. Destroying critical data can lead to severe operational issues.
   - **D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which can provide the attacker with further access but does not directly lead to significant disruption of the IT infrastructure.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Both T1486 and T1485 directly align with the goal of significant disruption. However, T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact) is more likely to achieve the goal of rendering the IT infrastructure unusable by making critical data inaccessible, which is a more direct form of disruption compared to data destruction.

**Final Answer: B: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
