Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where NanHaiShu initially communicates with C&C servers using IP addresses in the United States and later switches to a Chinese IP address.
   - The final step involves gathering and uploading system information using HTTP POST.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step involves establishing communication with C&C servers.
   - The communication involves resolving IP addresses, which could be dynamic or static.
   - The IP addresses are initially in the United States and later switch to a Chinese IP address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses, which fits the scenario where the IP addresses switch from the US to China.
   - **B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This is the same as A, so it's redundant.
   - **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves decoding information, which is not directly related to the IP address resolution or switching.
   - **D: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing web traffic, which is not directly related to the IP address resolution or switching.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs for establishing communication with C&C servers, where the IP addresses switch from the US to China, is T1568-Dynamic Resolution.

Final Answer: A
