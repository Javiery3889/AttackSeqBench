To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Compromise**: The question mentions that Gamaredon received spearphishing emails, which is a common initial vector for many cyber attacks.
2. **Persistence**: The group then achieved persistence by registering modules as scheduled tasks and inserting malicious macros into existing documents.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**: This technique involves adding entries to the XDG autostart directory to ensure that malware starts automatically when a user logs into a Linux system. This does not align with the initial compromise via spearphishing emails but rather with the persistence mechanism.

- **B: T1221-Template Injection**: This technique involves injecting malicious content into templates, which can be used to spread malware. However, the question specifies that the initial compromise was via spearphishing emails, not template injection.

- **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**: This technique involves embedding malicious code within image files. While this could be a method of initial compromise, it is not the most common or likely method for spearphishing emails.

- **D: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file or script. This aligns well with the initial compromise via spearphishing emails, as the emails would contain a malicious attachment or link that the user would need to execute.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for the initial compromise via spearphishing emails is T1204-User Execution.

**Final Answer: D**
