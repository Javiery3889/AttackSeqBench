Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The iOS malware app is installed with a hidden icon.
   - The app runs in the background immediately after installation.
   - The app then collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware is installed.
   - It runs in the background.
   - It collects data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding** - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be part of the malware's behavior, it doesn't directly relate to the installation or background execution.
   - **B: T1055.005-Thread Local Storage** - This technique involves using thread local storage to maintain state or data. This is more about how the malware stores data rather than how it installs or runs.
   - **C: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves executing code in a user context, which aligns with the malware running in the background after installation. This is a plausible step before data collection.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers** - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. This is more relevant to Linux systems and not directly related to iOS malware behavior.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware is installed, which is a prerequisite for any further actions.
   - The malware runs in the background, which is a critical step before it can start collecting data.
   - The technique that best fits the step of running in the background is T1204-User Execution, as it directly pertains to executing code in a user context.

**Final Answer: C: T1204-User Execution**
