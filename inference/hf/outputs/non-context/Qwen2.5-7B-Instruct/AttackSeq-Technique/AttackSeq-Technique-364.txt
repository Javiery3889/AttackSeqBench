Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - Execution of a credential dumping script (`mimi.ps1`).
     - Conducting memory reads on `lsass.exe`.
     - Lateral movement using `wmic.exe` to deploy `BADHATCH` to the Domain Controller.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1003.002 - Credential Dumping:** This technique involves dumping credentials from memory, which aligns with the use of `mimi.ps1` and memory reads on `lsass.exe`.
   - **T1021.001 - Lateral Movement:** This technique involves moving laterally within a network, which aligns with the use of `wmic.exe` to deploy `BADHATCH` to the Domain Controller.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching:** This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **B: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer:** This technique involves transferring tools to a target system for lateral movement, which is not the exact technique used in the question (it's more about deploying a tool rather than transferring it).
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This is the same as C, and it is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves credential dumping and then lateral movement. The most relevant technique for the initial step of credential dumping is T1003.002, but this is not listed as an option.
   - The most plausible technique from the given options that aligns with the described sequence is T1021.001, which is not listed, but the closest match in the options provided is T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer, which involves the deployment of a tool for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
