Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with exploiting known vulnerabilities through malicious documents.
   - The next step in the sequence is to conceal the identity of the C2 (Command and Control) server during communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Exploiting known vulnerabilities through malicious documents is a common initial access technique.
   - Concealing the identity of the C2 server is a technique used to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to evade detection. While it can be used to conceal data, it is not specifically about concealing the identity of the C2 server.
   - **B: T1197-BITS Jobs:** This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to concealing the C2 server's identity.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to obtain credentials or other sensitive information. It does not directly relate to concealing the C2 server's identity.
   - **D: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which can be used to conceal the true origin of the traffic and thus the identity of the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on concealing the identity of the C2 server.
   - Among the given options, T1090-Proxy is the most relevant because it directly involves routing traffic through a proxy, which can obscure the true origin of the communication.
   - The other options do not directly address the concealment of the C2 server's identity.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy
