Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The dropper malware delivered the main Bisonal payload.
   - The payload then established boot or logon autostart execution for persistence by creating a registry entry.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish command and control (C2) communications. It does not align with the persistence mechanism described.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves creating mechanisms that cause malware to run at startup or when a user logs on. This aligns with the described persistence mechanism of creating a registry entry for autostart execution.
   - **C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique involves maintaining bidirectional communications between the attacker and the compromised system. It does not align with the persistence mechanism described.
   - **D: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**
     - This technique involves using SSH authorized keys to gain access to a system. It does not align with the persistence mechanism described.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves establishing persistence through boot or logon autostart execution, which is directly aligned with the T1547 technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
