To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for initiating attacks by leveraging trusted relationships, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the initial compromise does not rely on user execution of malicious email attachments. Instead, it leverages trusted relationships to initiate the attack.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1137-Office Application Startup** - This technique involves the attacker causing a user to start an Office application that has been modified to execute malicious code. This does not align with the question's requirement of leveraging trusted relationships.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves the attacker using malicious content in an email to trick the user into taking an action, such as clicking a link or opening an attachment. This does not fit the requirement of leveraging trusted relationships.
   - **C: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment** - This technique is a more targeted form of phishing, where the attacker crafts a message that appears to come from a trusted source. This aligns well with the requirement of leveraging trusted relationships.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts** - This technique involves the attacker gaining access to a user's cloud account. While this can be used to initiate an attack, it does not directly leverage trusted relationships in the context of email or initial compromise.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the initial compromise does not rely on user execution of malicious email attachments but rather on leveraging trusted relationships.
   - Among the given options, T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (C) is the most relevant because it involves crafting a message that appears to come from a trusted source, which aligns with leveraging trusted relationships.

**Final Answer: C**
