To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
- **Pierogi backdoor** is communicating with predefined URLs.
- The backdoor is receiving commands and sending machine information.

### Answer Choices:
A. **T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique involves the attacker using a sequence of packets to a service on a port to gain access to a service. This does not directly relate to the backdoor communicating with predefined URLs.

B. **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves the attacker using a web service to exfiltrate data or to establish a command and control (C2) channel. Given that the backdoor is communicating with predefined URLs, this technique seems highly relevant as it involves using a web service for communication.

C. **T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves the attacker taking actions to reduce the defender's ability to detect or respond to the attack. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the communication aspect described.

D. **T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing**: This technique involves the attacker using a process with a parent process ID (PID) that is not the true parent of the process. This is not directly related to the communication aspect described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Communication Aspect**: The scenario describes a backdoor communicating with predefined URLs, which suggests a method of establishing a C2 channel.
2. **Evaluate Each Option**:
   - **T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This is not directly related to the communication with predefined URLs.
   - **T1102-Web Service**: This directly aligns with the use of predefined URLs for communication.
   - **T1562-Impair Defenses**: This is a defensive impairment technique, not directly related to the communication.
   - **T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing**: This is a process manipulation technique, not directly related to the communication.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the scenario, is the use of a web service for communication with predefined URLs.

Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
