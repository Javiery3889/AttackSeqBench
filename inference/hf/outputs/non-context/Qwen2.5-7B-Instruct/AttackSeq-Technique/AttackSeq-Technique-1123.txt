Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two main TTPs:
     1. Deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL.
     2. Establishing a simple remote command shell connecting to its C2 server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1218.008-Odbcconf**
     - This technique involves using the ODBC configuration tool to establish persistence. However, it does not directly relate to loading a malicious DLL or establishing a remote command shell.
   - **B: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS**
     - This technique involves using DNS queries to exfiltrate data or establish command and control (C2) communications. While it could be part of the C2 communication, it does not directly relate to the initial loading of the malicious DLL.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence and avoid detection. It is more about securing the communication channel rather than the initial loading of the malicious DLL.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to load a malicious DLL. This directly aligns with the first TTP mentioned in the question, which is deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is:
     1. Deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load a malicious DLL.
     2. Establishing a simple remote command shell connecting to its C2 server.
   - The technique that most plausibly occurs after deploying a renamed Microsoft component to load the malicious DLL is T1574-Hijack Execution Flow.

**Final Answer: D**
