Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where transaction data is intercepted using malicious scripts and sent to a collection server.
   - It then mentions that the stolen assets are funneled through a global exfiltration network using hijacked legitimate sites.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to execute the code. It is not directly related to intercepting transaction data or exfiltration.
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. It could be a precursor to injecting malicious scripts into checkout pages.
   - **T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves transferring funds or data at a scheduled time. It does not fit the context of intercepting and exfiltrating data.
   - **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not the intended one, which fits the description of using a global exfiltration network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This is the most plausible technique that could precede the injection of malicious scripts into checkout pages. Phishing can be used to distribute malware that injects the malicious scripts.
   - **T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:** This is not directly related to the interception and exfiltration of data.
   - **T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This is not relevant to the interception and exfiltration of data.
   - **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This is the technique used for exfiltrating data, but it does not fit the sequence as it is mentioned after the interception and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, where phishing (T1566) could precede the injection of malicious scripts (which is not directly listed but can be inferred as a precursor to T1055.001), and then the exfiltration over an alternative protocol (T1048), is best described by the answer choice that fits the initial phase of the attack.

Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
