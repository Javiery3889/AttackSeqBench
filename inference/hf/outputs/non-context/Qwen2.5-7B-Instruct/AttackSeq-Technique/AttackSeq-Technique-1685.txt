To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the attackers sent spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to the victim's systems, let's analyze each step and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing**: The question states that the attackers sent spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. This is the initial step in the attack sequence.

2. **Identifying the Next TTP**: After gaining initial access, the attackers would need to execute the malicious payload to establish a foothold on the victim's system. This execution is typically the next step in the attack sequence.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1098-Account Manipulation**: This technique involves modifying or creating accounts on a system. While it could be a step in the attack, it is not directly related to the execution of a payload that would follow the initial access via spear-phishing.

B. **T1059.007-JavaScript**: This technique involves the use of JavaScript to execute code. While it could be a method to execute the payload, it is not the most common or direct method following initial access via spear-phishing.

C. **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. This is more about the communication channel rather than the execution of the payload.

D. **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves convincing a user to execute a file or command. This is the most direct and common method to execute the payload after gaining initial access via spear-phishing.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access via spear-phishing is to convince the user to execute the malicious payload. Therefore, the most appropriate TTP is T1204-User Execution.

Final Answer: D
