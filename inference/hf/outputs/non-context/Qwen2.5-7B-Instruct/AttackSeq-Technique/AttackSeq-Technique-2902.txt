To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The question mentions the use of the 'yty' framework, which utilized plugins like 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots and 'mboard.exe' for system information gathering. This indicates that the initial phase of the attack involved data collection.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data. Given that the attack has already collected data (screenshots and system information), the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data.
   - **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves accessing data from information repositories. While this could be part of the data collection phase, the question already mentions specific plugins for data collection, so this might not be the next step.
   - **C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not a command and control (C2) channel. This is a specific method of exfiltration, but it is more detailed than the general exfiltration step implied by T1020.
   - **D: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique involves using a bootkit to maintain persistence. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the data collection phase described in the question.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack has already used the 'yty' framework to collect data through 'dspcheck.exe' and 'mboard.exe'.
   - The next logical step would be to exfiltrate this collected data.
   - Among the given options, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most general and directly related to the exfiltration of the data collected in the previous steps.

**Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
