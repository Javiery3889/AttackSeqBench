To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that TeamTNT compromised an exposed Weave Scope service to gain initial access. This step is not directly addressed in the answer choices, but it sets the stage for the subsequent TTPs.

2. **Deployment and Execution of Payload**: The question specifies that after gaining initial access, the attackers deployed and executed a coin miner payload. This implies that the attackers needed to use a technique that would allow them to run arbitrary code or scripts on the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves the execution of code in a serverless computing environment. While it is a valid technique, it is less likely to be the immediate step after gaining initial access to a system, especially if the system does not have a serverless computing environment.

B. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the use of a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. This is a common method for deploying and executing payloads on a compromised system, as it allows for the execution of arbitrary code.

C. **T1055.009-Proc Memory**: This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process. While this is a powerful technique, it is more advanced and typically used after gaining more control over the system, rather than immediately after initial access.

D. **T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves scanning the network to discover additional targets. This is not directly related to deploying and executing a payload on the compromised system.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the use of a command or scripting interpreter to execute the coin miner payload immediately after gaining initial access.

Final Answer: B
