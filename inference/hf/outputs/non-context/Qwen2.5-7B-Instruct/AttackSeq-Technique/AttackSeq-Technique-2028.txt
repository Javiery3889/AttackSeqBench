To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The Duke group used Seaduke to retrieve detailed bot/system information.
   - They then used a self-delete function named 'seppuku' to securely delete the malware from the system.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1218.013-Mavinject**: This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to maintain persistence. However, the question does not mention persistence or maintaining a presence on the system after the initial attack. It focuses on information gathering and cleanup.
   - **B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to hide malicious traffic. While this could be a part of the overall attack strategy, it is not directly related to the cleanup or information gathering steps mentioned.
   - **C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves encoding or encrypting data to make it harder to understand. Given that the malware was deleted using a self-delete function, it is plausible that the data or information gathered was obfuscated to avoid detection.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information. This does not align with the described cleanup and information gathering process.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Duke group used Seaduke to gather information, which aligns with data collection.
   - They then used 'seppuku' to delete the malware, which is a form of cleanup.
   - Among the given options, T1001-Data Obfuscation (Data Obfuscation) is the most relevant to the process of ensuring that the data collected is not easily detected or understood after the malware is removed.

**Final Answer: C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
