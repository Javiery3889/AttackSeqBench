To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique that facilitated the further delivery of malicious payloads after the initial Emotet phishing emails, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access via Emotet**: The attackers used Emotet to send out phishing emails.
2. **Delivery of Malware via Trickbot**: The phishing emails were used to deliver Trickbot spyware.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. While this could be a step in the process, it is not directly related to the initial delivery of the payload via phishing.
  
- **B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves sending a malicious attachment in a spearphishing email. Given that the initial attack involved sending phishing emails, this could be a plausible technique for delivering the Trickbot spyware.
  
- **C: T1542.004-ROMMONkit**: This technique involves using a ROMMON (Remote Operations Maintenance Monitor) to gain access to a device. This is not directly related to the phishing attack described.
  
- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is a broader category that includes various forms of phishing, including spearphishing. While this is relevant, it is more general and less specific to the delivery of a malicious attachment.

Given the context of the question, the most specific and relevant technique for delivering the malicious payload (Trickbot spyware) via a phishing email would be **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**.

**Final Answer: B**
