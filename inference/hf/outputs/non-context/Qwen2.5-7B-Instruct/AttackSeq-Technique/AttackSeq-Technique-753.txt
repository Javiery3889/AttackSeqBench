To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the NewPass implant is executed using the dropper's 'LocalDataVer' function.
   - After this, the loader decodes a binary file and extracts the agent component for defense evasion.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. It does not align with the described sequence as it is more about data exfiltration rather than the initial steps of decoding and extracting an agent component.
   - **B: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft:** This technique involves stealing or impersonating tokens to gain elevated privileges. While it can be a part of an attack, it is not directly related to the decoding and extraction of an agent component.
   - **C: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking:** This technique involves modifying or injecting code into dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to achieve persistence or evade detection. It is more about persistence and evasion but does not directly relate to the decoding and extraction of an agent component.
   - **D: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information:** This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information to reveal their true nature. This aligns closely with the described sequence where the loader decodes a binary file and extracts the agent component.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question mentions that after the execution of the NewPass implant, the loader decodes the binary file and extracts the agent component.
   - The decoding and extraction of the agent component are directly related to the deobfuscation and decoding of files or information, which is covered by T1140.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described attack sequence is T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.

Final Answer: D
