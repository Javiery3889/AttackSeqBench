Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where OnionDog uses USB worms similar to the Stuxnet approach to penetrate network isolation.
   - After this penetration, the Trojan successfully releases and downloads additional malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is the use of USB worms to penetrate network isolation, which aligns with the Stuxnet approach.
   - The next TTP is the release and download of additional malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools into a target network. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly describe the download of additional malware.
   - **B: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
     - This technique involves using WMI to execute code or commands. It is not directly related to the download of additional malware.
   - **C: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging**
     - This technique involves establishing a connection across network boundaries. It is more about maintaining persistence and access rather than downloading malware.
   - **D: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
     - This technique involves establishing a one-way communication channel from the target to a command and control server. This is a plausible TTP for downloading additional malware after the initial penetration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the malware has already penetrated the network and is now downloading additional malware.
   - The most relevant TTP for this scenario is one that describes the communication and download of additional malware, which aligns with the "One-Way Communication" technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
