Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors compromised over twenty high-profile websites to inject JavaScript code.
   - This JavaScript code then loaded additional malicious code from their Command and Control (C&C) servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs involves:
     1. Compromising the websites.
     2. Injecting JavaScript code.
     3. Loading additional malicious code from the C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves gaining access to a system or network to establish a foothold. While it is a precursor to the compromise of websites, it does not directly describe the injection of JavaScript or the loading of additional malicious code.
   - **B: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**
     - This technique involves modifying network traffic to include malicious content. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly describe the initial compromise of the websites.
   - **C: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**
     - This technique involves using code signing certificates to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate. This is not directly related to the initial compromise or the injection of JavaScript.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. In the context of the question, the JavaScript code that is injected and used to load additional malicious code from the C&C servers is a form of command and scripting interpreter. This aligns well with the sequence of events described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is best represented by the use of a command and scripting interpreter to execute the malicious JavaScript code.
   
Final Answer: D
