To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Taidoor modifies its network callback traffic to avoid detection. This implies that Taidoor has already performed some action to initially establish a foothold or retrieve information.
   - Specifically, the question states that Taidoor retrieves and decrypts encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts before modifying its network traffic.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using malicious websites, emails, or other methods to trick users into providing sensitive information. While phishing could be used to obtain credentials or other information, it does not directly address the decryption of encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts.
   - **B: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code** - This technique involves code that changes its appearance each time it runs but maintains the same functionality. While this could be used to evade detection, it does not directly address the decryption of encrypted text.
   - **C: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump)** - This technique involves dumping Management Information Base (MIB) data from network devices. This is not relevant to decrypting text from Yahoo Blogs posts.
   - **D: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** - This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding to reveal the true content of files or information. This directly aligns with the action of decrypting encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Taidoor needs to first obtain and decrypt the encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts.
   - The most relevant technique for decrypting encrypted text is T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.
   - After decryption, Taidoor modifies its network traffic to avoid detection, which is a separate TTP.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: D
