Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the attack began with Initial Access through phishing emails containing malicious Word documents. This is a clear indication of the T1566.001 technique, which involves using malicious documents to gain access.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**: The question asks which ATT&CK technique occurred before the PowerShell script executed payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. This implies we need to identify the technique that would logically precede the execution of a PowerShell script.

3. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique is not relevant to the initial stages of an attack and is more related to managing containerized environments, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **B: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which is not the same as the initial access through malicious documents. It is more about information gathering rather than the initial breach.
   - **C: T1552.003-Bash History**: This technique involves using the bash history to exfiltrate data. It is not relevant to the initial access or the execution of a PowerShell script.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute code. Given that the next step is the execution of a PowerShell script, this is the most logical choice as it directly precedes the execution of the script.

4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs, based on the attack sequence described, is that after the initial access through malicious documents, the next step would be the use of a command or scripting interpreter to execute the PowerShell script.

Final Answer: D
