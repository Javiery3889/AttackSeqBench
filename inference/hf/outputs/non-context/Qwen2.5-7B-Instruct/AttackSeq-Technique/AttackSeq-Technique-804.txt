Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the Higaisa group renamed 'certutil.exe' to 'gosia.exe' as a defense evasion tactic.
   - It also states that the group executed commands via 'cmd /c ipconfig' for discovery purposes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves defense evasion (renaming the executable) followed by command execution for discovery (using 'ipconfig').

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1124-System Time Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not directly related to the command execution for network configuration discovery.
   - **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which aligns with the use of 'ipconfig' for discovery.
   - **C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
     - This technique involves using reversible encryption, which is not directly related to the command execution for network configuration discovery.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands, which aligns with the use of 'cmd /c ipconfig'.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the group first evades detection by renaming an executable and then uses a command interpreter to execute a command for discovery.
   - T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) directly involves the use of a command interpreter, which is the step that follows the renaming of the executable.
   - T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) is the purpose of the command execution, but it does not describe the method of execution.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the steps described, is the use of a command interpreter to execute the command for discovery.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

Final Answer: D
