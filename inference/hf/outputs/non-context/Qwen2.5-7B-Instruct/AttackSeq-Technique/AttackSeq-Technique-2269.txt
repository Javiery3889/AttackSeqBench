Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack began with emails impersonating Mexico's tax department.
   - Victims were tricked into downloading a malicious attachment.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these initial steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial TTP: Email impersonating Mexico's tax department.
   - Follow-up TTP: Victims downloading a malicious attachment.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1187-Forced Authentication** - This technique involves forcing a user to authenticate to a system or service. It doesn't directly follow the scenario of downloading a malicious attachment.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - This technique involves collecting information about the victim, which could be done after the initial attack but doesn't directly follow the downloading of a malicious attachment.
   - **C: T1114-Email Collection** - This technique involves collecting email addresses or other email-related information. While it could be part of the initial reconnaissance, it doesn't directly follow the downloading of a malicious attachment.
   - **D: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies** - This technique involves exploiting trust relationships within a network. It could be a follow-up step after the initial attack to gain deeper access, but it's not the most direct follow-up to downloading a malicious attachment.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most direct and plausible follow-up to downloading a malicious attachment would be to execute the payload and establish a foothold in the network. However, none of the provided options directly describe this action.
   - Given the options, the closest to a plausible follow-up would be a technique that involves further exploitation or establishing a persistent presence, which is not directly listed but could be inferred as a follow-up to T1590.003.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - While none of the options perfectly fit the sequence, the closest and most plausible answer based on the provided choices is D: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies, as it involves further exploitation which could follow the initial download of a malicious attachment.

Final Answer: D
