To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question mentions that after the Shellbot gathers information about the infected host and its defenses, it uses an IRC channel to maintain communication with the C&C server. This implies that the Shellbot has already established a foothold and is now looking to maintain persistence and communication.

2. **Analyzing Each Option**:
   - **A: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting a weakness in the Windows Registry to maintain persistence. While this could be a method to maintain persistence, it does not directly relate to the communication channel (IRC) mentioned in the question.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain access. While this could be a method to communicate with the C&C server, it does not specifically address the use of an IRC channel.
   - **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access. This is more about the initial compromise rather than maintaining communication.
   - **D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves using dynamic DNS resolution to maintain persistence and avoid detection. This could be a method to maintain communication with the C&C server, especially if the C&C server is using a dynamic IP address.

3. **Reasoning**:
   - The question specifically mentions the use of an IRC channel to maintain communication. Among the options, T1568-Dynamic Resolution is the most relevant because it directly addresses the use of a dynamic resolution method, which could be used to maintain a persistent and covert communication channel, such as an IRC server.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of using an IRC channel to maintain communication, is T1568-Dynamic Resolution.

Final Answer: D
