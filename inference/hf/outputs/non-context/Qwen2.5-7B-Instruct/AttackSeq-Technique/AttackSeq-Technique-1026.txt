Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Screenshots taken every minute using a backdoor.
     2. Harvested sensitive data from removable drives.
     3. Uploading the harvested data to the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1600.001-Reduce Key Space:** This technique is related to reducing the key space of encryption, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C&C) channel. While it fits the last part of the sequence (uploading data to the C&C server), it does not address the harvesting of data from removable drives.
   - **T1056.003-Web Portal Capture:** This technique involves capturing data from web portals, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **T1025-Data from Removable Media:** This technique involves accessing and exfiltrating data from removable media, which directly aligns with the second part of the sequence (harvested sensitive data from removable drives).

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attacker first takes screenshots using a backdoor, then harvests sensitive data from removable drives, and finally uploads the data to a C&C server.
   - The technique that best fits the harvesting of data from removable drives is T1025-Data from Removable Media.
   - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel would be the technique that follows, but it is not the one that directly precedes the harvesting of data from removable drives.

**Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
