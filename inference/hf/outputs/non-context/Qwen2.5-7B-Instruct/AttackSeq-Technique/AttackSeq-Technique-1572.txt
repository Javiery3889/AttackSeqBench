To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
- **Turla** is a known APT group that has used sophisticated techniques, including leveraging PowerShell to run malware directly in memory.
- The malware is then executed in memory, which means it is not stored on the disk, making it harder to detect.
- After this, the malware is said to encrypt payloads to evade detection.

### Answer Choices:
A. **T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves using events to trigger the execution of malicious code. While it could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly relate to the memory execution or encryption of payloads.

B. **T1578-Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure**: This technique involves modifying cloud-based infrastructure to gain persistence or exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the in-memory execution or encryption of payloads.

C. **T1137-Office Application Startup**: This technique involves using legitimate office applications to execute malicious code. While it could be a method to execute malware, it doesn't directly follow the in-memory execution and encryption of payloads.

D. **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**: This technique involves discovering and using peripheral devices to exfiltrate data or gain access to the system. It is not directly related to the in-memory execution or encryption of payloads.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **In-Memory Execution**: The malware is executed in memory, which is a sophisticated technique to avoid detection.
2. **Encryption of Payloads**: After execution, the malware encrypts payloads to further evade detection.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible step after in-memory execution and before encryption would be a technique that involves data exfiltration or persistence, which is a common follow-up step in advanced persistent threats.

### Conclusion:
- **T1546-Event Triggered Execution** (A) could be a follow-up step to ensure the malware is executed at specific times, but it doesn't directly relate to the encryption of payloads.
- **T1578-Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure** (B) is not directly related to the in-memory execution or encryption of payloads.
- **T1137-Office Application Startup** (C) could be a method to execute malware but doesn't directly follow the in-memory execution and encryption of payloads.
- **T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery** (D) is a technique for data exfiltration or persistence, which is a logical follow-up to in-memory execution and encryption of payloads.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
