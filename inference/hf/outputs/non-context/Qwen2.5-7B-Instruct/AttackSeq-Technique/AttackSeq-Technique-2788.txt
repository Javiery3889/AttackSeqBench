To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that malicious JavaScript code was deployed into the MiMi chat application's installers for Defense Evasion.
   - It also states that Iron Tiger compromised MiMi's servers and injected backdoors during the application build process.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise** - This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malicious content to the target. It fits well with the scenario where Iron Tiger compromised MiMi's servers to inject backdoors during the application build process.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection** - This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate software or web pages. While it could be part of the deployment of malicious JavaScript, it does not directly address the initial compromise of MiMi's servers.
   - **C: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL** - This technique involves using the Netsh command to inject a helper DLL into network-related processes. It is not directly related to the scenario described.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not fit the scenario of compromising servers and injecting backdoors.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker (Iron Tiger) first compromises MiMi's servers and then injects backdoors during the application build process.
   - T1195-Supply Chain Compromise directly aligns with the scenario of compromising a third-party system (MiMi's servers) to deliver malicious content (backdoors) during the application build process.

**Final Answer: A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
