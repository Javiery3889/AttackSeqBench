To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Modular Malware with Partial AES-256 Encryption and Fileless Execution Techniques**: This indicates that the malware is designed to be modular, with parts of it encrypted and executed in memory to avoid detection.

2. **GreyEnergy Operators Used Only Selected Modules on Specific Targets for Increased Stealth**: This suggests that the attackers were selective in their use of malware components, likely to avoid detection and maintain stealth.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves using a remote service to gain access to a system. While it could be part of the initial compromise, it doesn't directly relate to the use of modular malware or the selective use of modules.

B. **T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling**: This technique involves using LNK files to spread malware. It is more about lateral movement and persistence rather than the modular nature of the malware or the selective use of modules.

C. **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols to exfiltrate data or deliver malware. It is more about data exfiltration or initial access rather than the modular nature of the malware or the selective use of modules.

D. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts on a system. It aligns well with the use of fileless execution techniques and the selective use of modules to avoid detection.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the one that directly supports the use of fileless execution and the selective use of modules for increased stealth. Therefore, the most fitting answer is:

Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
