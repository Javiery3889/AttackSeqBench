Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Delphi downloader has already executed and gathered system information.
   - It then sends this information to a C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to secure the communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning** - This technique involves an attacker using scanning tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. It does not pertain to securing communication.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encryption to secure the communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. This is directly related to securing the communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.
   - **C: T1071.004-DNS** - This technique involves using DNS to exfiltrate data or to establish a covert channel. While it can be used for communication, it is not specifically about securing the channel.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** - This technique involves altering the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. It does not pertain to securing communication.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is specifically about securing the communication channel.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel (B) is the only technique that directly addresses the security of the communication channel between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
