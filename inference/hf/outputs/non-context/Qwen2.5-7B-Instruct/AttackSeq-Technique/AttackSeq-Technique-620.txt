To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Initial Access (Template Injection)**: The question states that Gamaredon utilized template injection to deliver a malicious macro document. This is a method of initial access where the attacker uses a legitimate file format (like a Word document) to embed malicious code.

2. **Next Step**: After gaining initial access via the malicious macro document, the next step would likely be to ensure the malicious payload is executed automatically, without the need for user interaction.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves executing commands or scripts. While it is a valid technique, it is more about executing commands or scripts rather than ensuring the malicious payload is executed automatically.

B. **T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**: This technique involves using a virtual private server to host malicious content. This is not directly related to the execution of a payload on the victim's system after initial access.

C. **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that malicious code is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on. This is a plausible next step after initial access, as it ensures the malicious payload is executed automatically.

D. **T1569.001-Launchctl**: This technique involves using the launchd daemon on macOS to schedule the execution of a payload. This is also a valid technique for ensuring the payload is executed automatically, but it is more specific to macOS.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible next step after delivering a malicious macro document would be to ensure the payload is executed automatically. Both T1547 and T1569.001 are valid for this purpose, but T1547 is more general and can be applied across different operating systems, making it a more versatile and likely choice.

**Final Answer: C**
