To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the Moafee and DragonOK groups utilized custom-built backdoors and RATs to maintain access to victim networks.
   - It then states that 'CT/NewCT' payloads were executed using a 'CPU core check' for evasion.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**
     - This technique involves modifying or replacing software binaries on the host to gain or maintain access. This could be a step before executing 'CT/NewCT' payloads, as it would involve the initial compromise of the system.
   - **B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves sending a malicious link via spearphishing. While this could be a method to initially compromise a system, it does not directly align with the use of custom-built backdoors and RATs mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - Similar to B, this technique involves phishing to gain initial access. It does not directly align with the use of custom-built backdoors and RATs.
   - **D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
     - This technique involves developing capabilities to support the adversary's objectives. While this could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly align with the initial compromise or the execution of 'CT/NewCT' payloads.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attackers have already utilized custom-built backdoors and RATs to maintain access. This implies that the initial compromise has already occurred.
   - The next step would be to execute the 'CT/NewCT' payloads, which are likely to be the final payload used for malicious activities.
   - Among the given choices, T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary is the most plausible technique that would occur before the execution of 'CT/NewCT' payloads, as it directly involves the compromise of the host's software binaries, which could be the method used to maintain access and execute the final payload.

**Final Answer: A: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**
