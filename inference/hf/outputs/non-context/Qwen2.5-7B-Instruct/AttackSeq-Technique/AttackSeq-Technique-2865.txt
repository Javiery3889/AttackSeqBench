To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Suckfly's attempt to move laterally within the e-commerce company's internal network, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice.

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The initial step was scanning for open ports to expand the foothold.
   - The next step would be to move laterally within the network.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking a session to a remote service. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not the most direct or common method after port scanning.
   - **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access. This is a common method after identifying open ports and can be used for lateral movement.
   - **C: T1558.003-Kerberoasting**
     - This technique involves stealing Kerberos tickets to gain access to network resources. It is a method for lateral movement but is typically used after gaining initial access, not immediately after port scanning.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not the most direct method after port scanning.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - After scanning for open ports, the next logical step would be to exploit these open services to gain further access.
   - Exploiting remote services (T1210) is a common and direct method to move laterally after identifying open ports.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
