To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
   - It also mentions GreyEnergy obtaining domain administrator privileges by collecting passwords.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1133-External Remote Services:** This technique involves the use of remote services to establish a connection to a remote system. While it could be related to the use of PsExec and WinExe, it does not directly address the collection of passwords.
   - **B: T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution:** This technique involves the use of dynamic API resolution to bypass security mechanisms. It is not directly related to the use of tools for lateral movement or the collection of passwords.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves the use of remote services to establish a connection to a remote system, which aligns with the use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement. It is a plausible step before collecting passwords.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves the use of phishing to obtain credentials. While it could be a method to collect passwords, it does not directly align with the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement (T1021-Remote Services) is a common method to move laterally within a network.
   - After establishing a foothold, the attackers would likely use a technique to collect passwords, which could involve various methods, but the most direct and plausible method in the context of the given tools is likely to be a technique that allows for the exploitation of remote services to gain further access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement and the subsequent collection of passwords, is best described by T1021-Remote Services.

Final Answer: C
