Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a threat actor named TDrop2.
   - The first TTP mentioned is "process hollowing" for evading detection.
   - The second TTP is "disguised payload retrieval" for defense evasion.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was used to gather details about the infected system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1106-Native API** - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions that are not easily detectable. While this could be part of the process hollowing or payload retrieval, it does not directly relate to gathering system details.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as system configuration, network topology, and user information. This aligns well with the question's requirement to gather details about the infected system.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** - This technique is used to evade detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It does not directly relate to gathering system details.
   - **D: T1560.002-Archive via Library** - This technique involves archiving data using a library. It is not directly related to gathering system details.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the threat actor is gathering details about the infected system.
   - Among the given options, T1082-System Information Discovery (B) is the most relevant technique for gathering system details.
   - The other techniques (T1106, T1497, and T1560.002) do not directly relate to the task of gathering system details.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
