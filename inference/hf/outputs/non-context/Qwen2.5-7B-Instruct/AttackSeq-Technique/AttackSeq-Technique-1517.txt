To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **malspam campaign**: This is the initial attack vector, which is a common method for delivering malicious payloads.
2. **HTA file containing encoded commands to exploit CVE-2017-8579**: This indicates that the payload is delivered via an HTA (HTML Application) file, which is executed by the browser and exploits a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-8579) to gain initial access.
3. **ComboJack malware ensured persistence by setting a registry key**: This step ensures that the malware remains active even after the system is restarted.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to evade detection. It is not directly related to the execution of commands or persistence mechanisms, so it is less likely to be the next step after exploiting a vulnerability and before ensuring persistence.

B. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. After exploiting a vulnerability and executing an HTA file, the next step would likely be to execute commands or scripts to further compromise the system. This aligns well with the sequence of events.

C. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding files, processes, and network connections to evade detection. While this is a common practice, it is more likely to occur after the initial exploitation and command execution to avoid detection, rather than immediately after the HTA file is executed.

D. **T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-standard, encrypted channel. This is typically a later step in the attack lifecycle, after persistence and data collection have been established.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible next step after executing the HTA file and before ensuring persistence is to execute commands or scripts to further compromise the system.

Final Answer: B
