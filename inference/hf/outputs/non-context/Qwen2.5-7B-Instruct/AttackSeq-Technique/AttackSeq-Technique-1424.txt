To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions exploiting a CVE for Initial Access.
2. **Persistence**: The question asks about techniques used for Persistence, specifically mentioning macOS malware using a LaunchAgent or a persistent Chrome browser extension.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1102-Web Service**
- This technique involves using a web service to establish a foothold. While it can be a method of Initial Access, it does not directly relate to persistence on macOS using a LaunchAgent or a Chrome browser extension.

**B: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**
- This technique involves adding a public key to the authorized_keys file to gain access. While it can be a method of Initial Access, it also does not directly relate to persistence on macOS using a LaunchAgent or a Chrome browser extension.

**C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
- This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. This aligns well with the use of a LaunchAgent (which is a system process) or a persistent Chrome browser extension (which can be considered a process or a plugin that remains active).

**D: T1484.001-Group Policy Modification**
- This technique is specific to Windows environments and involves modifying Group Policy settings to maintain persistence. It does not apply to macOS.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves a technique that directly supports persistence on macOS. Therefore, the best answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process
