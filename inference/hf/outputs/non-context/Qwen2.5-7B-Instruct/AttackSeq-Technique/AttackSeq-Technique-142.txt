Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Context**: The question mentions exploiting a Ghostscript vulnerability via malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files. This indicates an initial vector of attack.

2. **Subsequent Action**: The question then asks about a technique that simplifies malicious EPS file code for better evasion from detection. This implies a post-exploitation step where the attackers modify the malicious payload to avoid detection.

3. **Evasion Techniques**: Among the provided answer choices, we need to identify which one is most relevant to simplifying code for better evasion.

   - **A: T1114-Email Collection**: This technique involves collecting email addresses from a system. It does not relate to code simplification or evasion.
   
   - **B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**: This technique involves modifying paths in scripts or executables to bypass security mechanisms. While it can be used for evasion, it does not directly relate to simplifying code.
   
   - **C: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Registry to run malicious code. It does not directly relate to code simplification or evasion.
   
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This can include simplifying code to make it less recognizable to security tools, which aligns with the question's requirement.

4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1070-Indicator Removal, as it directly addresses the need to simplify the malicious EPS file code for better evasion.

Final Answer: D
