To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **PurpleFox evaded detection by using an MSI package to install a rootkit driver.**
   - This indicates the use of a rootkit to maintain persistence and evade detection. This aligns with the T1014-Rootkit technique.

2. **PurpleFox blocked incoming connections via a firewall rule.**
   - This action is to prevent detection and ensure that the malware remains undetected by network monitoring tools. This is a common tactic to evade network-based detection mechanisms.

3. **Establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers.**
   - The question asks which technique is most likely to be used to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers after the initial evasion techniques.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to exfiltrate data or to establish a command and control (C&C) channel. However, it does not directly address the need to establish a bidirectional communication channel after evading detection.

B. **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves using traffic signaling to establish a covert channel. While it can be used to establish a communication channel, it is not the most direct or common method for establishing a bidirectional communication channel after evading detection.

C. **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves maintaining the ability to communicate even if the primary channel is disrupted. This is a plausible technique to ensure bidirectional communication after evading detection, as it provides a fallback mechanism.

D. **T1014-Rootkit**: This technique is about using a rootkit to maintain persistence and evade detection. While it is relevant to the initial steps, it does not directly address the need to establish a bidirectional communication channel.

Given the need to establish a bidirectional communication channel after evading detection, the most plausible technique is T1008-Fallback Channels, as it provides a mechanism to ensure communication even if the primary channel is disrupted.

Final Answer: C
