To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Escalating Privileges**: The question mentions that TG1021 used PotatoEx.dll and dynamic DLL loading to escalate privileges. This aligns with the T1543.003 technique, which involves using a legitimate process to load a malicious DLL.

2. **Impairing Defenses**: After escalating privileges, TG1021 employed multiple methods to impair defenses, such as interfering with logging mechanisms and evading EDR solutions. This action is best described by the T1562-Impair Defenses technique, which includes actions to avoid detection and analysis.

3. **Interfering with Logging Mechanisms and Evading EDR Solutions**: These actions are specific sub-techniques under T1562-Impair Defenses. T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging and T1562.004-Evade Host-based Detection are relevant here, but the question does not specify which one is used, so we need to look at the broader context.

4. **Dynamic API Resolution**: T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution is a technique used to bypass security mechanisms by resolving APIs at runtime. While this could be part of the broader evasion strategy, it is not directly mentioned in the sequence of actions described in the question.

5. **Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is related to the initial privilege escalation but does not directly describe the subsequent actions of impairing defenses.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Escalating privileges (T1543.003)
- Impairing defenses (T1562-Impair Defenses, which includes T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging and T1562.004-Evade Host-based Detection)

Therefore, the most relevant answer choice is the one that directly aligns with impairing defenses, which is T1562-Impair Defenses.

Final Answer: A: T1562-Impair Defenses
