Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Agrius exploited public-facing applications and uploaded webshells for lateral movement.
   - It then states that the group attempted defense evasion by obfuscating ASPXSpy webshells with a custom base64 encoding function.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography to secure communications or to authenticate users. It does not directly relate to the process of uploading webshells or obfuscating them.
   - **B: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying containers to execute malicious code. It does not align with the specific actions of uploading webshells or obfuscating them.
   - **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or evade detection. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the specific actions of uploading webshells or obfuscating them.
   - **D: T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification**
     - This technique involves modifying shell configuration files to maintain persistence or evade detection. It is more closely related to the process of obfuscating webshells, as it involves altering the configuration to avoid detection.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the group attempted to obfuscate ASPXSpy webshells with a custom base64 encoding function. This action is most closely aligned with modifying the configuration of the webshells to avoid detection, which is covered by the T1546.004-Unix Shell Configuration Modification technique.

**Final Answer: D**
