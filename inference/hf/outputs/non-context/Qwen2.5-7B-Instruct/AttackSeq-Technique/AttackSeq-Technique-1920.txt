To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and each answer choice step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT10 staged data for exfiltration using multi-part archives in the Collection phase, and this was facilitated by leveraging remote command execution scripts. We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before the data staging.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

#### A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
- **Description**: This technique involves the use of dynamic resolution to resolve domain names at runtime, often used to evade static domain blacklisting.
- **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to establish a foothold or maintain persistence, it does not directly relate to the data staging or exfiltration process.

#### B: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule
- **Description**: This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to redirect emails to a different address, often used for command and control (C2) communications.
- **Relevance**: This technique is more about establishing a communication channel rather than directly staging or exfiltrating data.

#### C: T1074-Data Staged
- **Description**: This technique involves the process of preparing data for exfiltration, which is the action described in the question (staging data for exfiltration).
- **Relevance**: This technique is directly related to the action of staging data, but it is the action itself, not a preceding step.

#### D: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server
- **Description**: This technique involves the use of a virtual private server (VPS) to host command and control infrastructure, often used for remote command execution.
- **Relevance**: This technique is closely related to the use of remote command execution scripts mentioned in the question. It provides a platform for executing commands remotely, which is a necessary step before data staging and exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **APT10 staged data for exfiltration using multi-part archives**: This is the final action in the sequence.
2. **Leveraging remote command execution scripts**: This is a necessary step to control the target system and prepare for the data staging and exfiltration.
3. **Data staging**: This is the action of preparing the data for exfiltration, which is the final step in the sequence.

Given the sequence, the most plausible preceding step is setting up a remote command execution environment, which aligns with the use of a virtual private server (VPS) to host the necessary infrastructure.

### Final Answer: D: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server
