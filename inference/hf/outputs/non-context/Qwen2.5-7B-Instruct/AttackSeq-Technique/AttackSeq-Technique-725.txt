To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice step-by-step.

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The question mentions that the second-stage binary was placed in the startup folder, which aligns with the T1543.003 - Create or Modify System Process (via File) technique. However, this is not directly relevant to the TTPs listed in the answer choices.

2. **Rising Sun Implant Communication**: The Rising Sun implant is communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests. This indicates that the implant has already been deployed and is now establishing a connection to its command and control (C2) server.

3. **Sequence of TTPs Before Communication**: We need to identify which of the given TTPs (PowerShell, Query Registry, System Checks, and Gather Victim Identity Information) most likely occurred before the communication.

- **A: T1059.001-PowerShell**: This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands. While it is a common method for post-exploitation activities, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for the communication with the C2 server.

- **B: T1012-Query Registry**: Querying the registry is a common method to gather information about the system and its configuration. This could be a step before establishing communication with the C2 server to understand the environment.

- **C: T1497.001-System Checks**: This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions or configurations. While it is relevant, it is more about ensuring the environment is suitable for the implant rather than a direct step before communication.

- **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: Gathering victim identity information is crucial for tailoring the attack and ensuring the implant is configured correctly. This is a strong candidate as it would be a necessary step before establishing communication with the C2 server.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be gathering victim identity information before the implant communicates with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
