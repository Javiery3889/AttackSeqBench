Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Stealthy Deployment:** GreyEnergy deployed only selected modules to selected targets when needed.
   - **Encryption:** These modules were partially encrypted using AES-256.
   - **Internal C&C Proxies:** Requests from infected nodes were redirected to an external C&C server on the internet.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The goal was to move laterally within the network.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is not directly related to the deployment and encryption of modules or the use of internal C&C proxies.
   - **B: T1564.002-Hidden Users**
     - This technique involves creating hidden users or accounts to hide the presence of the attacker. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly align with the described TTPs.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. The question mentions that the modules were partially encrypted using AES-256, which is a form of obfuscation. This aligns well with the described TTPs.
   - **D: T1584.008-Network Devices**
     - This technique involves using network devices to facilitate the attack. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly align with the described TTPs.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is best represented by the technique that directly addresses the encryption of the modules, which is T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.

Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information
