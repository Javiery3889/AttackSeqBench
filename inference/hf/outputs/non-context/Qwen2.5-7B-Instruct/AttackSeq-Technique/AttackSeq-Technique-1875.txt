To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Analysis of the Question:
The question describes a scenario where Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services for hosting its C2 (Command and Control) information to evade detection. This implies that the malware is trying to hide its communication channels by leveraging trusted services, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by security systems.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1566-Phishing**
- **Description**: This technique involves the use of malicious content to entice users to provide sensitive information or to install malware.
- **Relevance**: While phishing can be a method to deliver malware, it does not directly address the use of legitimate third-party services for C2 communication.

**B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
- **Description**: This technique involves encoding or encrypting files or information to make them less recognizable or to prevent analysis.
- **Relevance**: Obfuscation can be used to hide the true nature of the malware or its C2 communication, but it does not specifically address the use of legitimate third-party services.

**C: T1590.002-DNS**
- **Description**: This technique involves the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) or the use of legitimate DNS services to establish and maintain C2 communications.
- **Relevance**: This technique directly aligns with the scenario described in the question. By using legitimate DNS services, the malware can hide its C2 communications, making it harder for defenders to detect and block.

**D: T1036.007-Double File Extension**
- **Description**: This technique involves using a file extension that is not commonly associated with a particular file type to evade detection.
- **Relevance**: While this can be a method to hide the true nature of a file, it does not directly address the use of legitimate third-party services for C2 communication.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Core of the Question**: The core of the question is about the use of legitimate third-party online services to host C2 information to evade detection.
2. **Evaluate Each Option**:
   - **T1566-Phishing**: Does not directly address the use of legitimate third-party services.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: Does not directly address the use of legitimate third-party services.
   - **T1590.002-DNS**: Directly addresses the use of legitimate DNS services for C2 communication.
   - **T1036.007-Double File Extension**: Does not directly address the use of legitimate third-party services.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1590.002-DNS
