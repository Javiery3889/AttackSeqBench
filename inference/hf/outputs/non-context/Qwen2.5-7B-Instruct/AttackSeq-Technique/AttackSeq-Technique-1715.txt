To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Mustang Panda's communication with compromised systems after initial access via spearphishing and the double extension trick, let's analyze each step and the corresponding ATT&CK technique.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files, which is a form of social engineering. This aligns with the initial access phase.

2. **Defense Evasion**: The double extension trick (e.g., .docx.vbs) is used to evade detection by hiding malicious code within a seemingly benign file extension. This is a form of defense evasion.

3. **Communication**: The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated communication with the compromised systems. We need to identify the technique that is most likely to be used for maintaining a persistent and covert communication channel.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It is a plausible method for communication as it can be used to mask the traffic and avoid detection.

B. **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to evade detection. While this can be used for data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication, it is more about encoding rather than the protocol used for communication.

C. **T1010-Application Window Discovery**: This technique involves discovering and interacting with application windows to maintain persistence. It is more about maintaining persistence on the system rather than the communication method.

D. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware. It is related to the initial access phase and not the communication phase.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for facilitating communication with the compromised systems would be one that involves using standard protocols to mask the traffic, which aligns with T1071.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
