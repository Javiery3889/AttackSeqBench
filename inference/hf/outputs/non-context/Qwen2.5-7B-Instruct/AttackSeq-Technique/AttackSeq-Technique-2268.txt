Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where email accounts are exfiltrated through a POST web request.
   - The next step involves communication with domains to download malware and send collected data.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique facilitated the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy** - This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass external network security controls. It does not directly relate to the communication of a PowerShell script with domains.
   - **B: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile** - This technique involves modifying the PowerShell profile to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to the communication with domains.
   - **C: T1114-Email Collection** - This technique involves collecting email addresses or other email-related information. It does not directly relate to the communication with domains.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or communicate with command and control (C2) servers. This aligns with the communication of a PowerShell script with domains to download malware and send collected data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where data is exfiltrated and then a PowerShell script communicates with domains to download malware and send collected data.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this communication is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly involves using application layer protocols for C2 communication.
   - The other techniques (T1090.001, T1546.013, and T1114) do not align with the described communication step.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
