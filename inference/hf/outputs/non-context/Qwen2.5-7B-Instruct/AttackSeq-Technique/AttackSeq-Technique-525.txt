Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Anti-analysis techniques (sandbox detection)
   - Persistence (setting a registry key)
   - Secure communications with the C2 server
   - Obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the traffic and avoid detection. While it does involve obfuscation, it doesn't directly address the secure communications with the C2 server or the use of SSL/TLS encryption.
   - **B: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**
     - This technique involves using RDP to establish a remote connection. It does not align with the secure communications with the C2 server or the use of SSL/TLS encryption.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server. It directly addresses the secure communications with the C2 server and the use of SSL/TLS encryption, which fits the description in the question.
   - **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It does not align with the secure communications with the C2 server or the use of SSL/TLS encryption.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns best with the use of an encrypted channel to communicate with the C2 server while adding an additional layer of obfuscation within SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
