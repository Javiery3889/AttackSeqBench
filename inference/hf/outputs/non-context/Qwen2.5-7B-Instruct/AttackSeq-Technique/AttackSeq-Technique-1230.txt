Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is: 
     1. POWERSHOWER collected system information.
     2. The collected information was transmitted to the C2 server.
     3. The system entered a communications loop by utilizing a proxy.

2. **Identify the Key TTP:**
   - The key TTP in the sequence is the use of a proxy to establish a communications loop.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 communication. It fits the scenario of establishing a communications loop via a proxy.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic. While it is related to using a proxy, it does not specifically mention a multi-hop or looped communication.
   - **C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input from a GUI, which is not related to the use of a proxy for communications.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain access or perform actions. It is not related to the use of a proxy for communications.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the system entered a communications loop by utilizing a proxy. This implies a more complex and layered approach to communication, which is best described by T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy.
   - T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy is the most specific and relevant technique for establishing a communications loop via a proxy.

**Final Answer: A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
