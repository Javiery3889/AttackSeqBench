Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BRONZE PRESIDENT uses custom batch scripts to collate identified files and exfiltrates these archives.
   - The key part of the question is identifying which ATT&CK technique involves communication with hard-coded or malleable C2 (Command and Control) servers during the exfiltration stage.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using malicious content to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly relate to communication with C2 servers.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control communications. It is a broad category that could include communication with C2 servers.
   - **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:** This is a sub-technique of T1071 that involves the use of publish/subscribe protocols for C2 communications. It is more specific and could be relevant if the C2 communication uses such protocols.
   - **D: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking system configurations or state to determine if the system is in a desired state. It does not involve communication with C2 servers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is specifically about communication with C2 servers during the exfiltration stage.
   - T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) is a broad category that could include C2 communications.
   - T1071.005 (Publish/Subscribe Protocols) is a more specific sub-technique that directly involves the use of publish/subscribe protocols for C2 communications, which is a plausible method for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that involves communication with hard-coded or malleable C2 servers during the exfiltration stage is T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols.

Final Answer: C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols
