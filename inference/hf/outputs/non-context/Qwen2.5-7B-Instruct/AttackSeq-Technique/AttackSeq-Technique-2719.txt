1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malicious Word documents were delivered via spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1598-Phishing for Information** - This technique involves using information about the target to craft a more convincing phishing email. The use of personal data of the deputy head doctor aligns well with this technique.
   - **B: T1135-Network Share Discovery** - This technique involves discovering network shares, which is not directly related to the use of personal data in spear-phishing emails.
   - **C: T1591.002-Business Relationships** - This technique involves exploiting business relationships to gain access. While it could be relevant, it does not directly describe the use of personal data in the spear-phishing emails.
   - **D: T1204.002-Malicious File** - This technique involves using a malicious file, which is part of the scenario but does not address the use of personal data in the spear-phishing emails.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions the use of personal data in the spear-phishing emails to deceive the targets.
   - T1598-Phishing for Information directly addresses the use of information about the target to craft a more convincing phishing email.
   - The other techniques do not directly address the use of personal data in the spear-phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: T1598-Phishing for Information**
