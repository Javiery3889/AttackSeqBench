To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the malware established Initial Access using port-bound remote shell backdoors. This aligns with T1197 (Exploitation of Remote Services) or T1190 (Remote Services) in the ATT&CK framework, but these are not listed in the answer choices.

2. **Persistence**: The question then mentions that Gimmick or macOS.Macma malware used similarly labeled persistence agents. This aligns with T1543 (Persistence) in the ATT&CK framework.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: We need to find a TTP that logically occurs between Initial Access and Persistence. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

   - **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to run malicious code. It could be a step between Initial Access and Persistence, as it would allow the malware to maintain control over the system and ensure persistence.
   
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malware to the target. It is more of a broader strategy and not necessarily a step between Initial Access and Persistence.
   
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves executing malicious code in response to a specific event. While it can be used for persistence, it is not necessarily a step between Initial Access and the use of persistence agents.
   
   - **D: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**: This technique involves discovering cloud services that can be used for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. It is more related to C2 and not directly between Initial Access and Persistence.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible TTP that occurs between Initial Access and Persistence is T1574-Hijack Execution Flow, as it allows the malware to maintain control and ensure persistence.

**Final Answer: A**
