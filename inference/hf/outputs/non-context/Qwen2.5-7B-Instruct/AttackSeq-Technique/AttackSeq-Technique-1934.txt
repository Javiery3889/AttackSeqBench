Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. `sysOptimizer.bat` collects personal files.
     2. `sysCrt32.exe` initializes execution components.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to be used to transfer the collected data securely to FTP servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a network. It fits well with the scenario where data is being transferred to an FTP server.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run at a later time. While it could be used to automate the exfiltration process, it does not directly address the secure transfer of data to an FTP server.
   - **C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
     - This technique involves storing credentials in files, which is not directly related to the transfer of data to an FTP server.
   - **D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is a specific type of data storage. While it could be used for exfiltration, it is more specific than the general FTP transfer mentioned in the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the data is being transferred to FTP servers, which is a common method for secure data transfer.
   - T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most general and fitting technique for this scenario, as it covers the automated transfer of data to various destinations, including FTP servers.
   - The other techniques do not directly address the secure transfer to FTP servers as comprehensively as T1020 does.

**Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
