To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before APT41 collected source code and digital certificates from game production environments, we need to analyze the sequence of actions and identify the most plausible initial step.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that APT41 collected source code and digital certificates after moving laterally within targeted networks and pivoting between Windows and Linux systems.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves accessing and exfiltrating data from information repositories. It is a common initial step in data collection, as it allows the attacker to gather a wide range of data, including source code and digital certificates.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture:** This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. While it can be used to gather information, it is not typically the first step in data collection, especially for sensitive data like source code and digital certificates.
   - **C: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into web pages or other documents. It is more relevant to web-based attacks and less likely to be the initial step in collecting source code and digital certificates.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information. While phishing can be used to gain initial access, it is not typically the first step in collecting source code and digital certificates, especially after lateral movement.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step in collecting source code and digital certificates would likely involve accessing a repository where such data is stored.
   - T1213-Data from Information Repositories fits this description as it involves accessing and exfiltrating data from information repositories, which could include source code and digital certificates.

**Final Answer: A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
