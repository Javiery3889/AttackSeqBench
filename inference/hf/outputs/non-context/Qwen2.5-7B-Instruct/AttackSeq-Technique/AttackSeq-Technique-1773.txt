To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique used to gather details about the applications installed in the compromised environment before Sayad malware collected data, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it can be used to gather information, it is more focused on executing commands rather than discovering software.

2. **T1087.002-Domain Account**: This technique involves using domain accounts to gain access to resources. It is not directly related to discovering installed applications.

3. **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about software installed on the system. It is directly relevant to the task of discovering applications, which aligns with the question's context.

4. **T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**: This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect data. It is not related to discovering installed applications.

Given the context of the question, the most relevant ATT&CK technique for discovering installed applications is T1518-Software Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery**
