To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract payload components and install them to the specified directory**: This indicates that the malware has already been executed and is in the process of deploying its payload.

2. **FlowCloud malware setting keylogger drivers and malware configuration in the registry keys for persistence**: This suggests that the malware is establishing a method to ensure it remains active even after a system reboot.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves the use of software deployment tools to install or update software. While this could be part of the malware's deployment process, it doesn't directly address the persistence mechanism described.

B. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. Given that the malware has already been executed and payload components have been installed, phishing is less likely to be the immediate preceding step.

C. **T1137.005-Outlook Rules**: This technique involves creating Outlook rules to automatically execute malicious code. While this could be a method to deploy malware, it is not directly related to the persistence mechanism described.

D. **T1137-Office Application Startup**: This technique involves modifying Office applications to run malicious code when the application is launched. This aligns well with the persistence mechanism described, as setting keylogger drivers and malware configuration in the registry keys for persistence is a common method to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The malware has already executed and deployed payload components.
2. The next step is to ensure persistence, which involves modifying the registry to run the malware at startup.
3. Among the given options, T1137-Office Application Startup (D) is the most relevant to the persistence mechanism described.

**Final Answer: D**
