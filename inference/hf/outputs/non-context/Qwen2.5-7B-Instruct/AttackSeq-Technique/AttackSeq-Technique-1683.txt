To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the attackers first dumped Windows cached password hashes using PoisonIvy.
   - After this, they identified and moved laterally to systems hosting sensitive intellectual property.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
     - This technique involves using administrative shares in Windows to gain access to sensitive files or data.
     - This could be a plausible method for moving laterally after identifying systems with sensitive intellectual property.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code.
     - While this could be a method to initially gain access, it doesn't directly align with the lateral movement to systems with sensitive data.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, such as biometrics or smart cards.
     - This is not directly related to the lateral movement described in the question.
   - **D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
     - This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools.
     - While this could be a method to gain initial access, it doesn't directly align with the lateral movement to systems with sensitive data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers first use PoisonIvy to dump cached password hashes, which is a method to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, they need a method to move laterally to systems with sensitive intellectual property.
   - T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares is a common method for lateral movement in Windows environments, as it allows access to sensitive files and data through administrative shares.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of moving laterally to systems with sensitive intellectual property, is T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares.

Final Answer: A
