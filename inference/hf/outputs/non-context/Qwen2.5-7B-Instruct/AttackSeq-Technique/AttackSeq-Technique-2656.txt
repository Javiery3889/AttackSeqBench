To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Custom Loader**: The question mentions a custom loader that decrypted and executed an encrypted payload in memory. This indicates that the initial stage of the attack involves a custom or malicious software that is designed to evade detection and execute its payload.

2. **Persistence**: Before establishing persistence, the attacker would need to perform some actions to ensure the payload remains active and undetected. The question specifies that persistence was established using a scheduled task or a Run registry entry, which are techniques to ensure the malware remains active after the initial infection.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: We need to identify which technique was most likely utilized immediately after the custom loader decrypted and executed the payload in memory, but before persistence was established.

- **A: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not the most immediate action after the payload is executed in memory.
  
- **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Again, this is a step that would likely occur after persistence is established, not immediately after the payload is executed.

- **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. However, the question specifies that persistence was established using a scheduled task or a Run registry entry, which are different from creating or modifying system processes.

- **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system to identify potential vulnerabilities or to understand the environment. This is a common step that attackers perform immediately after gaining initial access to understand the system and plan further actions.

Given the sequence of events described, the most plausible TTP to be utilized immediately after the custom loader decrypted and executed the payload in memory would be to gather information about the system to understand the environment and plan further actions.

**Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
