To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique that would ensure the payload could maintain a foothold on the system after using the Invoke-Obfuscation tool's COMPRESS technique, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1569-System Services**: This technique involves adding a service to the system that runs at boot time or on logon. While this could help maintain persistence, it is not directly related to the obfuscation and execution of a payload.

2. **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one expected by the network. This is more related to data exfiltration rather than maintaining a foothold on the system.

3. **T1137.004-Outlook Home Page**: This technique involves modifying the Outlook Home Page to redirect users to malicious websites. This is more about redirecting users and is not directly related to maintaining a foothold on the system.

4. **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves ensuring that a malicious payload is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on. This is directly related to maintaining a foothold on the system, as it ensures the payload remains active and can execute commands or further attacks.

Given the context of the question, which mentions using obfuscation to prepare the payload for execution, the most logical next step would be to ensure the payload can run automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This would help maintain a persistent presence on the system.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
