Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Elise malware initiates queries to ipaddress.com to obtain WAN IP addresses.
   - The malware then leverages system network configuration details to further its profiling activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1087.003-Email Account:** This technique involves using email accounts for malicious purposes, which does not align with the described network-based activity.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications, which is not directly related to the network configuration details.
   - **T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves sending malicious content via email, which is not directly related to the network configuration details.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which aligns with the described activity of leveraging system network configuration details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1087.003-Email Account:** This does not fit the context of network-based activities.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This does not fit the context of network configuration details.
   - **T1534-Internal Spearphishing:** This does not fit the context of network configuration details.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This fits the context of gathering network configuration details, which is a logical step after obtaining WAN IP addresses.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware first initiates queries to ipaddress.com to obtain WAN IP addresses (which is not a specific ATT&CK technique but a step in the process).
   - After obtaining the WAN IP addresses, the malware would need to gather more detailed network configuration information to further its profiling activities.
   - The most plausible ATT&CK technique that fits this step is T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, as it directly involves gathering network configuration details.

**Final Answer: D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
