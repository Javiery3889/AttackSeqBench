To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the adversary's entry into the target system before the obfuscated JavaScript payload executed by the VBA-Macro functions started communicating with the IP 66.133.129.5, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves the use of malicious content, such as a malicious attachment or link, to entice a user to perform an action that results in the compromise of the system. Phishing is a common initial vector for many cyber attacks, often leading to the execution of malicious code.

2. **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system or product that is used by the target organization. While this can be a sophisticated method, it is less likely to be the initial entry point for the described attack sequence, as it would typically involve a more complex and indirect approach.

3. **T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves modifying the system's search order for dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to load a malicious DLL instead of the intended one. This technique is more about maintaining persistence and lateral movement rather than the initial entry point.

4. **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While this is a common technique used after initial entry, it is not the method that facilitates the initial entry into the system.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible initial entry point would be through a phishing attack, as it is a common and effective method for delivering malicious content to a user, leading to the execution of the VBA-Macro and subsequent obfuscation of the payload.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
