To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Tickusb's malicious activities were triggered by opening specific programs instead of running at system startup, let's analyze each option in the context of the described scenario.

1. **T1059.005-Visual Basic**: This technique involves the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute malicious code. While it is a method of execution, it does not directly relate to the persistence or triggering of malicious activities through program execution.

2. **T1070.009-Clear Persistence**: This technique involves removing or disabling persistence mechanisms to avoid detection. However, the question specifies that the malicious activities were triggered by opening specific programs, which implies a form of persistence or execution mechanism that is not being removed or disabled.

3. **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves the attacker leveraging user actions to execute malicious code. This aligns well with the scenario where the malicious activities are triggered by opening specific programs. It suggests that the attacker has already set up a mechanism for the malware to execute when the user performs a specific action.

4. **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a program to include malicious code. While this can lead to the execution of malicious code, it does not directly address the scenario of the malicious activities being triggered by opening specific programs.

Given the scenario where the malicious activities are triggered by opening specific programs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve setting up a mechanism for the malware to execute when the user performs a specific action. This aligns best with the T1204-User Execution technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1204-User Execution**
