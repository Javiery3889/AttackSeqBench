Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attack sequence described includes:
     1. Showing a decoy document to the victim.
     2. Executing a background exploit.
     3. Installing a keylogger.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves the attacker deploying software to the victim's system. However, it does not specifically describe the execution of a background exploit or the installation of a keylogger.
   - **B: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
     - This technique is about preparing the environment for the attacker's use, which could include setting up the conditions for the background exploit. However, it does not directly describe the execution of the exploit or the installation of a keylogger.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique directly describes the execution of a background exploit, which fits the sequence after showing the decoy document and before installing a keylogger.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or control the victim's system. It does not directly describe the execution of a background exploit or the installation of a keylogger.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, as it directly describes the execution of a background exploit, which occurs after showing the decoy document and before installing a keylogger.

**Final Answer: C**
