Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an APT group uses DLL side-loading to evade defenses. This involves loading malicious DLLs through renamed clean loaders.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is the execution phase, where the APT group aims to execute malicious code via legitimate Windows executables.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is DLL side-loading, which is a technique to load malicious code into a legitimate process.
   - The next TTP in the sequence is the execution of malicious code via a legitimate Windows executable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1204.002-Malicious File:** This technique involves using a malicious file to execute code. While it is related to the execution phase, it does not directly describe the use of legitimate Windows executables.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules:** This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules, which can be relevant to DLL side-loading. However, it does not specifically address the execution of malicious code via legitimate executables.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to inject malicious code. While it is a broader attack vector, it does not directly describe the execution phase via legitimate executables.
   - **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is not directly related to the execution phase via legitimate executables.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is the use of DLL side-loading to load malicious DLLs, followed by the execution of malicious code via legitimate Windows executables.
   - The technique that best fits the execution phase, where malicious code is executed via legitimate executables, is **T1129-Shared Modules**. This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules, which can be used to load and execute malicious code.

**Final Answer: B: T1129-Shared Modules**
