To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze each step and choice:

1. **Identify the Context**: The question mentions the SolarWinds incident, which involved a sophisticated supply chain attack where attackers used a backdoor with overlapping features with Kazuar (a known malware family).

2. **Sequence of TTPs**: The question states that after establishing command and control using a backdoor, another technique occurred prior to this. We need to identify which technique logically precedes the establishment of command and control.

3. **Evaluate Each Choice**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a command and control channel. While it is relevant to command and control, it does not necessarily precede the establishment of a backdoor.
   - **B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**: This technique involves delivering malware through a malicious attachment in a spearphishing email. This is a common initial vector for many cyber attacks, including supply chain attacks, and could logically precede the use of a backdoor.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system to gain access to a target organization. Given the context of the SolarWinds incident, this is a plausible initial step where the attackers compromised SolarWinds' systems to insert the backdoor.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule the execution of commands or scripts. While it could be used in the context of maintaining persistence, it does not directly precede the establishment of a backdoor.

4. **Reasoning**:
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (C)** is the most plausible initial step in the SolarWinds attack sequence. The attackers would first need to compromise SolarWinds' systems to insert the backdoor.
   - **T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (B)**, while a common initial vector, is less specific to the SolarWinds context. The SolarWinds attack was more about supply chain compromise rather than a typical spearphishing attack.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol (A)** and **T1053.006-Systemd Timers (D)** are more about maintaining control and persistence, which occur after the initial compromise.

**Final Answer: C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
