To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that malicious shortcut files were used to gain initial access. This aligns with the T1194 technique, which involves using malicious files to establish a foothold.

2. **Next Step**: The question states that the next step was the employment of anti-analysis features of Asruex to evade detection. Asruex is a malware known for its use of anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection by security tools.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**: This technique involves using legitimate software to hide malicious activity. It does not directly follow the use of malicious shortcut files for initial access and does not align with the next step of anti-analysis.

B. **T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code in a serverless computing environment. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly follow the use of malicious shortcut files for initial access.

C. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. After gaining initial access via malicious shortcut files, the next step would likely be to use a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts, which could include the deployment of malware or further lateral movement.

D. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. While it can be used to evade detection, it does not directly follow the use of malicious shortcut files for initial access.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access via malicious shortcut files and before employing anti-analysis features is the execution of commands or scripts to further the attack.

Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
