To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Infiltration**: APT35 infiltrated a corporate device. This is the initial step, but it is not explicitly listed in the answer choices.

2. **Maintaining Persistence**: The group maintained persistence by using valid accounts and exhibited persistent C2 (Command and Control) beaconing. This indicates that the attackers have established a foothold and are ensuring their access remains undetected.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1546.009-AppCert DLLs**: This technique involves using application certification digital signatures to evade detection. While this could be a method to maintain persistence, it does not directly relate to the use of valid accounts or C2 beaconing.

B. **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves the use of valid user accounts to gain access to systems. This aligns well with the description of maintaining persistence by using valid accounts.

C. **T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves the use of software deployment tools to deploy malicious software. While this could be part of the initial infiltration, it does not directly relate to the use of valid accounts or C2 beaconing.

D. **T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves impairing or removing security controls to maintain access. While this could be a method to maintain persistence, it does not directly relate to the use of valid accounts or C2 beaconing.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP that aligns with the use of valid accounts and C2 beaconing is T1078-Valid Accounts.

**Final Answer: B**
