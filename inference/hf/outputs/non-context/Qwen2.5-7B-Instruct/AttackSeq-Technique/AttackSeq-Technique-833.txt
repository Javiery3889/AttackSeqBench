To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **WinDealer encoded its configuration files using XOR for defense evasion.**
   - This indicates that the malware is using a simple encryption method (XOR) to obfuscate its configuration files, which is a form of data encryption.

2. **Before it discovered network configuration and SNS application details on the victim's PC.**
   - This suggests that the malware is in the process of gathering information about the network and applications on the victim's system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
   - This technique involves using the Windows Command Shell to execute commands. While this could be part of the malware's behavior, it doesn't directly relate to the data discovery phase described in the question.

B. **T1106-Native API**
   - This technique involves using native Windows APIs to perform actions. This could be relevant if the malware is using native APIs to gather information, but it is not specifically about data discovery.

C. **T1036-Masquerading**
   - This technique involves making the malware appear to be legitimate software. While this could be part of the malware's behavior, it is not directly related to the data discovery phase.

D. **T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**
   - This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography, which is not directly related to the XOR encoding mentioned in the question. However, it is more relevant to the data discovery phase if the malware is using encryption to secure the data it discovers.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be one that directly relates to the data discovery phase. The technique that best fits this description is T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography, as it involves the use of encryption, which is relevant to the XOR encoding mentioned and could be used to secure the data the malware discovers.

Final Answer: D
