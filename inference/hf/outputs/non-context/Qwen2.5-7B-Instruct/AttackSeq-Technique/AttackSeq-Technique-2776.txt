Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence where backdoor malware is used for stealthy code execution.
   - This is followed by a technique to maintain access.
   - Finally, the technique leverages the remote-desktop protocol (RDP) for lateral movement.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1136-Create Account**
     - This technique involves creating new user accounts to maintain persistence.
     - It does not directly relate to maintaining access through a backdoor or leveraging RDP.
   - **B: T1586-Compromise Accounts**
     - This technique involves compromising existing user accounts to maintain access.
     - It could be a plausible method to maintain access after initial compromise.
     - However, it does not directly involve leveraging RDP.
   - **C: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking dynamic link libraries to maintain persistence.
     - It is more about maintaining persistence and does not directly involve leveraging RDP.
   - **D: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**
     - This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to maintain persistence.
     - It is a method to ensure that malicious code is executed every time PowerShell is started.
     - This could be a plausible method to maintain access after initial compromise and before leveraging RDP for lateral movement.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor malware is used for initial stealthy code execution.
   - To maintain access, modifying the PowerShell profile (T1546.013) ensures that the malware continues to run every time PowerShell is used.
   - Once access is maintained, the attacker can then use RDP for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**
