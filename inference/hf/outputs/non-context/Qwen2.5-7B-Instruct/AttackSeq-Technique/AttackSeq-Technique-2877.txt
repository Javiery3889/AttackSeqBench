To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Extracting Data**: The question mentions that data such as encrypted messaging app content and geolocation are extracted and stored in SQLite databases. This step is likely part of the data collection phase.

2. **Uploading Data**: The data is then uploaded to C2 (Command and Control) servers through unique server paths. This step involves transferring the collected data to a remote server.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. While this could be relevant for the data transfer phase, it does not specifically address the storage of data in SQLite databases.

B. **T1560-Archive Collected Data**: This technique involves archiving the collected data. While it is related to storing data, it does not specify the method of storage (e.g., SQLite databases).

C. **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This sub-technique involves archiving data using a custom method. This could be relevant for storing data in SQLite databases, as it allows for the use of a custom method for data storage.

D. **T1218-System Binary Proxy Execution**: This technique involves executing a system binary as a proxy to perform actions. This is not directly related to the storage or transfer of data.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible technique that aligns with the storage of data in SQLite databases before uploading it to C2 servers is **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**.

**Final Answer: C**
