To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
- **Initial TTP**: UNC1945 gained persistence on a Solaris 9 server by installing the SLAPSTICK backdoor.
- **Persistence Mechanism**: The backdoor was installed in the `/lib64/security` folder, which is a common location for system libraries and security-related files.

### Answer Choices:
A. **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher-level access. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to maintaining persistence through tampered files.

B. **T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft**: This technique involves stealing or impersonating a token to gain unauthorized access. This is not directly related to maintaining persistence through tampered files.

C. **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This technique involves modifying the image file execution options to execute malicious code. This could be a plausible step after gaining persistence, as it would allow the backdoor to be executed every time the system starts or a specific service is run.

D. **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise. While this is a common step after gaining access, it is not directly related to maintaining persistence through tampered files.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Gaining Persistence**: The backdoor is installed in the `/lib64/security` folder, which is a common location for system libraries and security-related files. This ensures the backdoor is loaded every time the system starts.
2. **Subsequent TTP**: To maintain this persistence, the next logical step would be to ensure the backdoor is executed every time the system starts or a specific service is run. This aligns with the concept of modifying the image file execution options to execute the malicious code.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining persistence through tampering with files in the `/lib64/security` folder would be to ensure the backdoor is executed every time the system starts or a specific service is run.

**Final Answer: C**
