Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where `sysBus32.exe` downloads and executes a second stage from a C2 server, and other executables like `libCache32.exe` perform their tasks.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the communication with the C2 infrastructure hosted on Novinhost.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture** - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not relevant to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools to a target system, which is more about the initial transfer rather than the ongoing communication with the C2 server.
   - **C: T1008-Fallback Channels** - This technique involves using alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is detected or blocked. This could be relevant if the primary C2 channel is being monitored or blocked, and the attackers use a fallback channel to maintain communication.
   - **D: T1106-Native API** - This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions, which is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the communication with the C2 server, which is a critical aspect of maintaining control over the compromised system.
   - `T1008-Fallback Channels` is the most relevant because it directly addresses the use of alternative communication methods to ensure that the attackers can maintain contact with the C2 server even if the primary method is detected or blocked.

**Final Answer: C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
