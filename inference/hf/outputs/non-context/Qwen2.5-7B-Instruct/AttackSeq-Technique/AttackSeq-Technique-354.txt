To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Evasion Techniques**: The question mentions that the threat actors used Masquerading and Subvert Trust Controls to evade defenses. These techniques are part of the Evasion tactics in the ATT&CK framework, which are designed to avoid detection and analysis.

2. **Objective**: The threat actors' objective is to gather internal system information to further their objectives. This suggests that the next step would be to identify and collect data from the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking a service session to gain unauthorized access to a service or application. While this could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly relate to gathering internal system information.

B. **T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying processes running on a system, which is crucial for understanding the current state of the system and identifying potential targets for further exploitation. This aligns well with the objective of gathering internal system information.

C. **T1003.003-NTDS**: This technique involves accessing the Active Directory database, specifically the NTDS.dit file, which contains user account information and other sensitive data. This is a direct method for gathering internal system information, but it is more specific to Windows environments and might be too narrow given the general nature of the question.

D. **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering systems on a network, which is a broader step than just gathering internal system information. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it is not as specific to the immediate objective of gathering internal system information.

Given the objective of gathering internal system information, the most direct and relevant technique would be T1057-Process Discovery, as it directly addresses the need to understand the current state of the system.

**Final Answer: B**
