To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Explosive Trojan**: This indicates the initial malware that was used to gain initial access to the network.
2. **Move laterally using manual methods and USB infection**: This suggests that after gaining initial access, the attacker manually moved through the network and used USB drives to spread the infection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. While it could be a method used after lateral movement, it doesn't directly align with the manual methods and USB infection described.

B. **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to steal credentials or other sensitive information. It doesn't directly align with the manual lateral movement and USB infection described.

C. **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**: This technique involves using a valid ticket to access network resources, which is a common method for lateral movement in a network. Given that the question mentions manual methods and USB infection, this could be a plausible next step after gaining initial access and moving laterally.

D. **T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves using chat applications to exfiltrate data or maintain communication with the attacker. While it could be a method used after gaining access, it doesn't directly align with the manual methods and USB infection described.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the one that directly follows the initial access and manual lateral movement. **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket** is a common method for maintaining or expanding access within a network, which aligns well with the described scenario.

Final Answer: C
