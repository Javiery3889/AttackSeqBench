Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs during the hacking targets phase.
   - It mentions reusing command and control (C2) infrastructure from other groups and separating spear-phishing infrastructure from malware C2 infrastructure.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to establish communication channels to maintain control over the victim environment.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves the use of traffic signaling to control or manipulate network traffic. It is not directly related to establishing communication channels for C2.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection:** This technique involves injecting content into web pages or other network traffic to deliver malicious payloads. It is more about delivering content rather than establishing communication channels.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which is not directly related to establishing C2 channels.
   - **D: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves the use of a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary to maintain anonymity and control over the communication channels. This aligns well with the need to establish and maintain control over the victim environment.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question emphasizes the need to establish and maintain control over the victim environment.
   - Reusing C2 infrastructure and separating spear-phishing from malware C2 infrastructure suggest a need for a method to control and route communications.
   - T1090-Proxy (D) directly addresses the need to route traffic through an intermediary, which is a common method to maintain control and anonymity in C2 communications.

**Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy**
