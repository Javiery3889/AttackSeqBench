Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions leveraging exploits on Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411.
   - This is followed by a strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website.
   - The sequence ends with leveraging the Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**
     - This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute code. It doesn't directly relate to exploiting web applications or leveraging web compromises.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications. It aligns with the exploitation of Internet Explorer through CVEs and the web compromise of the Daily NK website.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While it could be a step in the sequence, it doesn't directly follow the exploitation of the web application.
   - **D: T1003.003-NTDS**
     - This technique involves accessing NTDS.dit files, which are specific to Windows domain controllers. It doesn't align with the web compromise or the use of the Microsoft Graph API.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the initial step is exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, followed by compromising a website, and then using the Microsoft Graph API for command and control.
   - The most plausible step that fits between exploiting the web application and using the Microsoft Graph API would be the exploitation of the web application itself.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
