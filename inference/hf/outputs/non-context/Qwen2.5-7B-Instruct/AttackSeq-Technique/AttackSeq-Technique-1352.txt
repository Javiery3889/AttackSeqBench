Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious Flash file ('show.swf') is used to install a payload.
   - The payload is then embedded in an animated GIF image to avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is the exploitation of a Flash file to install a payload.
   - The second step is hiding the payload by embedding it in an animated GIF.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves using a vulnerability to execute code on a client system. While it fits the initial step of exploiting the Flash file, it does not address the embedding of the payload in an animated GIF.
   - **B: T1218.007-Msiexec**
     - This technique involves using the Windows Installer service (msiexec) to execute malicious payloads. It does not align with the embedding of the payload in an animated GIF.
   - **C: T1552.006-Group Policy Preferences**
     - This technique involves using Group Policy to deploy malicious payloads. It does not fit the context of embedding the payload in an animated GIF.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding or obfuscating artifacts to avoid detection. Embedding the payload in an animated GIF is a method to hide the payload and avoid detection, which aligns with this technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is best represented by T1564-Hide Artifacts.

Final Answer: D
