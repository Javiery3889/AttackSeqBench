Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two TTPs:
     1. Exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to gain initial access.
     2. Modifying timestamps of dropped files to mimic kernel32.dll using timestomping.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
     - This technique involves techniques to avoid detection by debuggers. While it could be a subsequent step to avoid detection, it does not directly relate to the modification of file timestamps.
   - **B: T1562.009-Safe Mode Boot**
     - This technique involves booting the system in safe mode to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the modification of file timestamps.
   - **C: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting a weakness in file permissions of services to gain persistence. It does not directly relate to the modification of file timestamps.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that malware runs when the system boots or when a user logs on. While it could be a step after gaining initial access, it does not directly relate to the modification of file timestamps.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question specifically mentions the modification of timestamps of dropped files to mimic kernel32.dll using timestomping. This is a technique to evade detection by making the dropped files appear legitimate. The most plausible sequence would be a technique that directly leads to this action.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is not directly related to the options provided, as none of them directly describe the timestomping technique. However, the closest and most relevant technique in the list would be one that could lead to the execution of the malware, which is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
