To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The adversary used cloud storage web services for large-scale data exfiltration after compression, encryption, and staging.
   - Before this, the question asks about exfiltrating small amounts of data containing account details.

2. **Evaluating Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique involves using legitimate system management tools to perform actions that would otherwise require elevated privileges. It does not directly relate to data exfiltration.
   - **B: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**
     - This technique involves duplicating network traffic to evade detection. It is more about traffic manipulation rather than data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves using a command and control (C2) channel for data exfiltration. It is a plausible method for exfiltrating small amounts of data, especially if the data is sensitive like account details.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically related to data exfiltration.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible technique for exfiltrating small amounts of data containing account details, which could then be used for larger-scale exfiltration via cloud storage, is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. This technique aligns with the use of a C2 channel, which is a common method for stealthy and controlled data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
