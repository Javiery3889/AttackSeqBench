Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a piece of malware (FAKEM RAT) disguises its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols such as Windows Messenger or Yahoo! Messenger.
   - The goal is to hinder detection through encryption manipulation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key TTP here is the disguise of network traffic to appear as legitimate protocols, which involves manipulating the encryption or protocol to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1600-Weaken Encryption**
     - This technique involves reducing the effectiveness of encryption to make the traffic easier to analyze. However, it does not directly address the disguise of network traffic to appear as legitimate protocols.
   - **B: T1053.003-Cron**
     - This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks. It does not relate to disguising network traffic or encryption manipulation.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a command and control channel. It aligns with the scenario of disguising network traffic to look like legitimate protocols.
   - **D: T1562.007-Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying cloud firewalls to bypass security controls. It does not directly address the disguise of network traffic or encryption manipulation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on disguising network traffic to look like legitimate protocols, which is a form of obfuscation.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol (C) is the most relevant technique as it involves using application layer protocols to establish communication, which can be used to disguise the traffic.
   - The other techniques do not align with the specific scenario described in the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
