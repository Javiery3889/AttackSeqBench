To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions spear phishing activities targeting the ASEAN region.
   - It also mentions that the focus of reconnaissance efforts followed these activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Spear phishing (T1566.001) is a technique where attackers send customized emails to specific targets to gain access to systems or information.
   - Reconnaissance (T1040) is the process of gathering information about the target to plan further attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
     - This technique involves scanning a range of IP addresses to identify open ports and services. While it can be part of reconnaissance, it is not directly related to the spear phishing activity.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using web services to perform malicious activities. It is not directly related to the spear phishing activity or the reconnaissance that follows.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gather information. While it is related to phishing, it is not the next step after reconnaissance but rather a part of the initial attack vector.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves using obfuscation to hide malicious files or information. It is a common step after reconnaissance to avoid detection and to ensure that the payload is not easily identified.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Spear phishing (T1566.001) is the initial attack vector.
   - Reconnaissance (T1040) follows to gather information about the target.
   - After gathering information, the attackers would likely use obfuscation (T1027) to hide their malicious files or information to avoid detection.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is that after reconnaissance, the attackers would use obfuscation to hide their malicious files or information.
   - Final Answer: D
