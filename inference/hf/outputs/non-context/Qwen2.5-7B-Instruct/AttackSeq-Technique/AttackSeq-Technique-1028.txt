Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where sensitive documents are scanned from various storage locations (drives, network shares, removable drives).
   - The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of the collected data to a Command and Control (C&C) server by Gamaredon.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs involved are:
     1. Scanning for sensitive documents.
     2. Exfiltrating the collected data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots or portions of the screen. It does not align with the described sequence of scanning drives and exfiltrating data.
   - **B: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**
     - This technique involves collecting email data from local email clients. While it could be part of a broader data collection strategy, it does not directly align with the described sequence of scanning drives and exfiltrating data.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native APIs to access system resources. While it could be used in the process of scanning drives, it does not directly describe the exfiltration of data.
   - **D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the search order to intercept and redirect file access. While it could be used to facilitate the scanning of drives, it does not directly describe the exfiltration of data.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the scanning of drives (which could involve various techniques, but not specifically listed here) followed by the exfiltration of the collected data.
   - The technique that most directly aligns with the exfiltration of data to a C&C server is not explicitly listed in the choices. However, the closest and most relevant technique in the list is the one that could facilitate the process of collecting and then exfiltrating data.

Given the choices, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the exfiltration of data, would be a technique that could facilitate the process of collecting and then exfiltrating data. Among the choices, T1106-Native API (C) is the closest to a technique that could be used in the process of scanning drives and potentially exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: C: T1106-Native API**
