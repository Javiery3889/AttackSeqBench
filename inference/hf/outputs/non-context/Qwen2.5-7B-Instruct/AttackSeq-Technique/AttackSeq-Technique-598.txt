To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given attack sequence and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Adversaries used tools like punk.py to collect credentials.**
   - This indicates the use of a tool for credential harvesting, which aligns with T1003 - Collection.

2. **Created hidden user accounts.**
   - This suggests the use of T1098 - Create Account, where adversaries create accounts that are not easily detectable.

3. **Exfiltrated AWS credentials to a C2 server.**
   - This indicates the use of T1048 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, where data is exfiltrated through a command and control server.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence:

A. **T1200-Hardware Additions**
   - This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain unauthorized access. It does not align with the sequence of collecting credentials and creating hidden user accounts.

B. **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
   - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols to communicate between systems. While it could be part of the communication channel, it does not directly align with the sequence of collecting credentials and creating hidden user accounts.

C. **T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
   - This technique involves compromising the infrastructure to gain access or maintain persistence. It could be relevant as a precursor to creating hidden user accounts and exfiltrating credentials, but it is more broad and not as specific to the sequence.

D. **T1090-Proxy**
   - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic and mask the true source of the traffic. While it could be used to exfiltrate data, it does not directly align with the sequence of collecting credentials and creating hidden user accounts.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible technique that occurred before AWS credentials were exfiltrated to a C2 server is T1584-Compromise Infrastructure, as it aligns with the broader context of setting up the environment for persistence and data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C**
