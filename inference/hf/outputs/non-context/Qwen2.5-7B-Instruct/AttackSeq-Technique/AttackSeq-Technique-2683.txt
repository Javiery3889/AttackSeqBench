Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where KiraV2 first conducts telnet dictionary attacks to compromise IoT devices using weak credentials.
   - After compromising the IoT devices, KiraV2 employs anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and maintain a long-term infection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is T1110 (Brute Force) to compromise IoT devices.
   - The subsequent TTP is an anti-analysis technique to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking** - This technique involves hijacking COM objects to execute arbitrary code. It does not directly relate to the initial compromise of IoT devices via telnet dictionary attacks.
   - **B: T1653-Power Settings** - This technique involves manipulating power settings to evade detection. While it could be part of the anti-analysis phase, it does not directly relate to the initial compromise of IoT devices.
   - **C: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure** - This technique involves compromising a system to use it as a base of operations. While it could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly relate to the initial compromise of IoT devices via telnet dictionary attacks.
   - **D: T1110-Brute Force** - This technique involves using automated tools to guess user credentials. This directly aligns with the initial compromise of IoT devices via telnet dictionary attacks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, where T1110 (Brute Force) is the initial compromise technique, followed by anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence, is best represented by answer choice D.

Final Answer: D
