To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Initial Access**: Attackers used a zero-day vulnerability to target users through a compromised Veteran of Foreign Wars website.
2. **Next Step**: We need to identify the next likely TTP after the initial access.

### Answer Choices Evaluation:
- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a command and control channel. While it could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the initial access through a compromised website.
- **B: T1199-Trusted Relationship**: This technique involves the attacker exploiting a trusted relationship to gain access to a system. It is more about establishing a foothold rather than the immediate next step after initial access.
- **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website or drive-by download. Given that the initial access was through a compromised website, this could be a plausible next step.
- **D: T1608.001-Upload Malware**: This technique involves uploading malware to a system. This is a common step after initial access, but it is more about the malware delivery rather than the next step after the initial compromise.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used a zero-day vulnerability to target users through a compromised website.
2. **Next Step**: After gaining initial access, the attackers would need to ensure the compromise is not detected and maintain control. A drive-by compromise (T1189) fits well here as it describes the act of compromising a user's system through a malicious website, which aligns with the scenario of a compromised Veteran of Foreign Wars website.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access through a compromised website would be a drive-by compromise to ensure persistence and further exploitation.

**Final Answer: C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
