To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Obfuscated batch scripts to evade antivirus detection**: This indicates the use of a technique to bypass security measures, which is a common initial step in many attack sequences.

2. **Living-off-the-land techniques**: This suggests the use of legitimate system tools or processes to carry out malicious activities, which is a tactic to avoid detection.

3. **Dexphot writing five key files to disk for execution by targeting legitimate system processes**: This indicates the final step where the malware or payload is deployed and executed using legitimate system processes to avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
- This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly align with the sequence of obfuscation and living-off-the-land techniques mentioned.

**B: T1218.008-Odbcconf**
- This technique involves using the `odbcconf` tool to modify ODBC configuration files. It is not directly related to the sequence of obfuscation and living-off-the-land techniques.

**C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
- This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run at a later time. While it can be used to execute files later, it does not directly align with the sequence of obfuscation and living-off-the-land techniques.

**D: T1055-Process Injection**
- This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to execute it. This aligns well with the sequence of using living-off-the-land techniques to execute files by targeting legitimate system processes.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred before Dexphot wrote five key files to disk for execution by targeting legitimate system processes is **T1055-Process Injection**.

Final Answer: D
