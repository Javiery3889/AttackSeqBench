Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collected files from the local system and data directories.
   - It also mentions that the component enumerated multiple data directories to collect GPS and hardware information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is the collection of files and data from local directories.
   - The second TTP is the enumeration of multiple data directories to gather GPS and hardware information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
     - This technique involves the use of cloud storage services to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the described TTPs of collecting and enumerating local data.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, which is not related to the described TTPs of collecting and enumerating local data.
   - **C: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
     - This technique involves the use of a network provider DLL to modify network traffic. It does not align with the described TTPs of collecting and enumerating local data.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, including hardware and software details. This aligns well with the described TTPs of collecting GPS and hardware information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1082-System Information Discovery.

Final Answer: D
