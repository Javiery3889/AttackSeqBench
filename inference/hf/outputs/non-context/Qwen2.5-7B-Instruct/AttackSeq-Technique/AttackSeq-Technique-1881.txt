To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the described sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **FIN13 used trojanized versions of KeePass binaries to establish persistence.**
2. **Executed commands via cmd.exe using the BLUEAGAVE backdoor.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **T1554-Compromise Client Software Binary:**
   - This technique involves compromising software that is already installed on the target system. In the context of the question, FIN13 used trojanized versions of KeePass binaries, which is a form of client software. This technique directly aligns with the use of trojanized KeePass binaries for persistence.

2. **T1098.005-Device Registration:**
   - This technique involves registering a device with a remote management service. While it can be a method of establishing persistence, it is not directly related to the use of trojanized binaries or the execution of commands via cmd.exe.

3. **T1134.005-SID-History Injection:**
   - This technique involves modifying the Security Identifier (SID) history to evade detection. It is not directly related to the use of trojanized binaries or the execution of commands via cmd.exe.

4. **T1132-Data Encoding:**
   - This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not directly related to the use of trojanized binaries or the execution of commands via cmd.exe.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is the use of trojanized binaries to establish persistence. This aligns directly with the ATT&CK technique T1554-Compromise Client Software Binary.

**Final Answer: D**
