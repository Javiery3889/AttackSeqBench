Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The dropper uses an OLE package to decode and execute shellcode from the CVE-2017-11882 exploit.
   - This is part of the Initial Access phase.
   - After this, files such as iassvcs.exe, sqlite3.dll, and RasTls.dll are created and loaded for subsequent execution.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial access is through the CVE-2017-11882 exploit.
   - The next step is the creation and loading of files, which is a form of persistence or execution of malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to the creation and loading of files.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it is related to the initial access, it does not describe the creation and loading of files.
   - **C: T1059.001-PowerShell:** This technique involves using PowerShell to execute malicious code. It is more about the execution of code rather than the creation and loading of files.
   - **D: T1543.001-Launch Agent:** This technique involves creating and loading a file or script to run at system startup or on demand. This aligns well with the creation and loading of files like iassvcs.exe, sqlite3.dll, and RasTls.dll.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the creation and loading of files for subsequent execution is T1543.001-Launch Agent.

Final Answer: D
