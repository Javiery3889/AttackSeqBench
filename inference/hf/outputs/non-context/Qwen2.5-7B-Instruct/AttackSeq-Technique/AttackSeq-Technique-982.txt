To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **Komplex Dropper Ensures Persistence**: This step involves modifying file permissions and creating directories, which aligns with the persistence technique T1543.003 - File Deletion on Boot.

2. **XAgent Component Checks for Debugger**: This is a method of defense evasion, which can be categorized under T1073 - Obfuscated Files or Information, specifically T1073.001 - Anti-Debugging.

Now, we need to identify which technique most likely occurred before the XAgent component checked for the presence of a debugger.

- **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding files, registry entries, or other artifacts to avoid detection. While it is a form of evasion, it does not directly relate to checking for a debugger.

- **B: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts. It does not directly relate to checking for a debugger.

- **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves detecting and evading virtualized or sandboxed environments. While it is a form of evasion, it does not directly relate to checking for a debugger.

- **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing or using credentials from password stores. It does not directly relate to checking for a debugger.

Given the context, the most plausible technique that would occur before the XAgent component checks for a debugger is one that involves some form of initial access or lateral movement that could be used to establish a foothold and then proceed to check for a debugger. However, none of the provided options directly fit this description. 

Since the question asks for the most plausible sequence and T1073.001 - Anti-Debugging is the closest to the action of checking for a debugger, we need to look for a technique that could precede this action. The most logical preceding step would be a technique that establishes a foothold or initial access, which is not directly listed in the options.

Given the options, the closest and most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion

This is because virtualization/sandbox evasion techniques are often used to establish a foothold and then proceed with more specific evasion techniques like anti-debugging. However, it's important to note that the question's phrasing and the provided options make this a less than ideal match.
