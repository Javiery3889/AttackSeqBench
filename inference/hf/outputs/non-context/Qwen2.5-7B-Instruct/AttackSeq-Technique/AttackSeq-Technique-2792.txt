Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already gathered information from a compromised iOS device.
   - The next step involves facilitating communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned are related to gathering information and then using web services to communicate with a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning:** This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It does not directly relate to web services or POST/GET requests.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using web services to communicate with a remote server. It aligns with the use of POST and GET requests to interact with a C2 server.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery:** This technique involves identifying software on the target system. While it could be part of the initial reconnaissance, it does not directly relate to the communication with a C2 server.
   - **D: T1001.001-Junk Data:** This technique involves sending junk data to overwhelm or confuse the target. It does not align with the use of POST and GET requests for communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the attacker is using POST and GET requests to communicate with a C2 server. This indicates a web service interaction.
   - T1102-Web Service (B) is the only technique that directly involves using web services for communication, which matches the described TTP.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
