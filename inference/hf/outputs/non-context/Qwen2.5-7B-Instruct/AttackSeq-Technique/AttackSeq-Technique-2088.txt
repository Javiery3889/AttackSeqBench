To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The question mentions that Carbanak conducted reconnaissance by collecting data related to banking applications and internal procedures. This aligns with T1048 - Reconnaissance, but the specific technique mentioned is T1197 - Network Scanning, which is a subset of T1048. However, the question does not specify a particular technique for reconnaissance, so we can consider this as a general reconnaissance phase.

2. **Data Collection**: The next step is the collection of data related to banking applications and internal procedures. This is more specific and aligns with T1082 - Data from Local System, which involves gathering information from the local system, including data from banking applications and internal procedures.

3. **Lateral Movement**: The question states that the next step is to download and execute new payloads to move laterally in the infrastructure. This aligns with T1074 - Lateral Movement, which involves moving from one system to another within the target network.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malware to the target organization. It does not directly align with the sequence of collecting data and then moving laterally.

B. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to deliver malware. While it can be part of the initial attack vector, it does not directly align with the sequence of collecting data and then moving laterally.

C. **T1584.005-Botnet**: This technique involves using a botnet to perform malicious activities. It does not directly align with the sequence of collecting data and then moving laterally.

D. **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which can be used for lateral movement. This aligns well with the sequence of collecting data and then moving laterally.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP that follows data collection and precedes lateral movement is T1003-OS Credential Dumping.

Final Answer: D
