To determine the most plausible next TTP after CosmicDuke conducts discovery by searching for files on hard drives and network drives matching specific patterns, including non-English filenames, we need to analyze each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to run malicious code. While this could be a subsequent step, it is more about persistence rather than immediate information gathering.

2. **T1115-Clipboard Data**: This technique involves accessing and stealing data from the clipboard. Given that CosmicDuke has already discovered files with specific patterns, it is less likely that the next step would be to steal clipboard data, as this does not directly relate to the file discovery phase.

3. **T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**: This technique involves loading and using kernel-level code to gain privileges or perform actions. This is a more advanced and intrusive step that would typically follow deeper reconnaissance or privilege escalation, rather than immediate information gathering.

4. **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. Given that CosmicDuke has already discovered files with specific patterns, capturing screenshots could be a method to gather visual information about the environment, which might include sensitive data or configurations that were not directly found in files.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- CosmicDuke has already conducted discovery by searching for specific files.
- The next step should logically be to gather more information from the environment.
- Screen captures (T1113) provide a visual representation of the environment, which can include additional information that might not be evident from file searches alone.

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
