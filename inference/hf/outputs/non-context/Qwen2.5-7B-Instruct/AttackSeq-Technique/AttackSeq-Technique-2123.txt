To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Internal Network Scanning**: The attackers first performed internal network scanning to find open RDP and SMB ports. This is a common initial step in reconnaissance to identify potential targets.

2. **Administrator Accounts**: After identifying open ports, the attackers used administrator accounts to deploy RDP and tools like `csvde.exe` and `AdFind` on servers. This step is aimed at gaining access to the network and extracting credentials.

3. **Tools Used**: The use of `csvde.exe` and `AdFind` suggests that the attackers are looking to extract Active Directory information, which is a common technique for credential dumping.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**: This technique involves intercepting or bypassing multi-factor authentication. It does not align with the described sequence, as the attackers are not focusing on bypassing MFA but rather on gaining access to credentials.

B. **T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves discovering domain trusts to gain access to additional networks or domains. While this could be a part of a broader attack, it does not directly align with the described sequence of using administrator accounts and tools to access credentials.

C. **T1037.001-Logon Script (Windows)**: This technique involves using logon scripts to execute malicious code. While this could be a method to gain access, it does not directly align with the described sequence of using administrator accounts and tools to access credentials.

D. **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system. This aligns perfectly with the described sequence, as the attackers are using administrator accounts and tools like `csvde.exe` and `AdFind` to access and extract credentials.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial step of network scanning (T1046) is not directly listed in the answer choices but is a precursor to the described sequence.
2. The use of administrator accounts and tools like `csvde.exe` and `AdFind` to access credentials directly aligns with T1003-OS Credential Dumping.

**Final Answer: D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
