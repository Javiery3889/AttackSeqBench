To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each step:

1. **Mimikatz to Dump Credentials**: This is a technique used to extract credentials from memory, which is part of T1003-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, but it's not a direct TTP in the sequence we are evaluating.

2. **Pass the Hash**: This technique involves using stolen hashes to authenticate to other systems without needing the plaintext password. This is part of T1003-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel as well, but again, it's not a direct TTP in the sequence.

3. **Lateral Movement Using Impacket's atexec Tool**: This tool is used to execute commands on remote systems using the at command, which is a form of lateral movement. This aligns with T1078-Exfiltration Through Removable Media, but more specifically, it's a form of lateral movement that can be categorized under T1028-Exfiltration Through Removable Media.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A. **T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating remote systems. It would likely occur before lateral movement to identify potential targets. This seems plausible as a precursor to lateral movement.

B. **T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or hide malicious activity. It is not directly related to the initial steps of identifying and moving to a target system.

C. **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the system owner or user to gain additional information or credentials. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is more likely to occur after the initial discovery of the target system.

D. **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not the primary network connection. It is not directly related to the initial steps of identifying and moving to a target system.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible step that would occur before lateral movement is the discovery of remote systems. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: T1018-Remote System Discovery
