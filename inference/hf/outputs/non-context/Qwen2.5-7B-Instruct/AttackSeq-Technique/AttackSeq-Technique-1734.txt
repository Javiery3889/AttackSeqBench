Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving credential access using ProcDump and Mimikatz, and lateral movement using 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - The next step in the sequence is to map databases, servers, and open ports within the target networks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Credential Access (T1110)
   - Lateral Movement (T1548.001 for pass-the-hash)
   - The next step is to map the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering internet connections, which is not directly related to mapping databases, servers, and open ports within the target networks.
   - **B: T1654-Log Enumeration**
     - This technique involves enumerating logs, which is not directly related to mapping databases, servers, and open ports.
   - **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternate authentication material, which is not directly related to mapping databases, servers, and open ports.
   - **D: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering network services, which aligns with the need to map databases, servers, and open ports within the target networks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1046-Network Service Discovery.

Final Answer: D
