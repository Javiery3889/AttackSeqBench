To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Regin maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure, let's analyze each step:

1. **Identify the Context**: Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its advanced capabilities, including data collection through RAT features like capturing screenshots and monitoring network traffic.

2. **Analyze Each Option**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This tactic involves using standard application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. While this could be a method for data exfiltration, it doesn't directly address the maintenance of communication with the C2 infrastructure.
   - **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This tactic involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data or commands. This could be used to maintain communication by making the data or commands less detectable, but it doesn't directly address the method of communication.
   - **C: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This tactic involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While this could be used to monitor network traffic, it doesn't directly address the method of maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure.
   - **D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**: This tactic involves injecting Security Identifier (SID) history into the system to maintain persistence and evade detection. This is more about maintaining a presence on the system rather than the method of communication.

3. **Determine the Best Fit**:
   - The question asks about maintaining communication with the C2 infrastructure, which implies a method of data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant here as it directly addresses the method of communication using standard protocols, which is a common method for maintaining C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
