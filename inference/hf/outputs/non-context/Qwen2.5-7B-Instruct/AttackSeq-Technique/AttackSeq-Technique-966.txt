Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Naikon APT group has already staged internal reconnaissance data from the victim machine.
   - The next step in the sequence is the secure transmission of this data to a C&C (Command and Control) domain.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is "staging internal reconnaissance data," which is covered by T1082-System Information Discovery.
   - The next TTP is the secure transmission of this data to a C&C domain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection, but it does not specifically address the secure transmission of data.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts:** This technique involves using valid accounts to gain access to systems, which is not relevant to the secure transmission of data.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with a C&C server, which is directly related to the secure transmission of data.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique is already mentioned in the question as the initial step and does not cover the secure transmission of data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the data has been staged and now needs to be securely transmitted.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel (C) is the most relevant technique for securely transmitting data to a C&C domain.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
