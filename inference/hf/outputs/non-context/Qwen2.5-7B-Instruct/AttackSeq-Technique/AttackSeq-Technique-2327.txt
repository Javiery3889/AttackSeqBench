Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Shamoon malware overwrites the disk's boot records as part of its defense evasion strategy.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to achieve the destruction of target data on disks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP mentioned is "overwriting the diskâ€™s boot records" (Shamoon's defense evasion strategy).
   - The next TTP should be the destruction of target data on disks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1562-Impair Defenses**
     - This technique involves actions to prevent or delay detection and response by defenders. Overwriting boot records is a form of impairing defenses, but it does not directly destroy data.
   - **B: T1485-Data Destruction**
     - This technique involves the destruction of data, which aligns with the next step in the attack sequence after overwriting the boot records.
   - **C: T1496.002-Bandwidth Hijacking**
     - This technique involves the manipulation of network traffic to consume bandwidth or disrupt network operations. It does not align with the destruction of data on disks.
   - **D: T1484-Domain Policy Modification**
     - This technique involves changing domain policies to gain unauthorized access or privilege escalation. It does not align with the destruction of data on disks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is the destruction of target data on disks, which aligns with the T1485-Data Destruction technique.

Final Answer: B
