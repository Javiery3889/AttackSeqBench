Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     - Utilizing encryption
     - Mimicking legitimate network traffic
     - Facilitating communication between malware and C2 server using HTTP
     - Using a hardcoded User-Agent string

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1657-Financial Theft**
     - This technique is related to financial theft and does not specifically address the communication method or the use of HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. It aligns with the use of HTTP for communication, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography for data protection. While it aligns with the use of encryption mentioned in the question, it does not address the communication method or the User-Agent string.
   - **D: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
     - This technique involves the use of malicious links to deliver malware or exfiltrate data. It does not align with the use of HTTP for C2 communication or the hardcoded User-Agent string.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is best described by T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly addresses the use of HTTP for C2 communication, which is a key element in the question.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
