To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Hidden Cobra distributed their Bankshot implants through domains resembling legitimate cryptocurrency platforms, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves the attacker using network traffic to signal to the command and control (C2) server or other attackers about the status of a compromised system or the success of an operation. While this could be part of the post-exploitation phase, it is not directly related to the initial reconnaissance or the initial compromise phase.

2. **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves the attacker gathering information about the target organization, such as network topology, system configurations, and user information. This is a crucial step in the reconnaissance phase, where the attacker would gather information to tailor the attack to the specific target. This aligns well with the initial phase of the attack sequence described, where the attacker would need to understand the target environment to effectively distribute the implants.

3. **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves the attacker scanning IP address blocks to identify potential targets or to gather information about the target network. While this is a common initial reconnaissance technique, it is more focused on identifying potential targets rather than understanding the target organization in detail, which is more aligned with T1591.

4. **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves the attacker creating a scheduled task or job to run a malicious payload at a later time. This is typically a post-exploitation technique used to ensure persistence on the target system, rather than a reconnaissance technique.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would start with gathering detailed information about the target organization, which would then allow the attacker to tailor the attack, including the use of domains that resemble legitimate cryptocurrency platforms to distribute the Bankshot implants.

Final Answer: B: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information
