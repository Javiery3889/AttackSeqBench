Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves delivering a PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro.
   - This macro then uses `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is the delivery of the malicious PowerPoint document.
   - The next step is the execution of the VBA macro.
   - The final step is the use of `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick the user into providing information or downloading malicious content. While this could be part of the initial delivery of the PowerPoint document, it does not directly describe the execution of the VBA macro or the use of `mshta.exe`.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. The use of `mshta.exe` to execute a script (in this case, to download and execute a dropper) aligns with this technique.
   - **C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking** - This technique involves modifying the search order for dynamic-link libraries to load a malicious DLL. This does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** - This is the same as B, and it aligns with the use of `mshta.exe` to execute a script.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Both B and D are the same and correctly describe the use of `mshta.exe` to execute a script, which is a command and scripting interpreter technique.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is best described by T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
