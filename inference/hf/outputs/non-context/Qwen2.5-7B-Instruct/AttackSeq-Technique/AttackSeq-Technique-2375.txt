Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the malware used a defense evasion technique (T1070-Indicator Removal) to self-delete on a hardcoded date.
   - The malware then collected detailed information about system properties, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, during its reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While this is mentioned in the question, it does not describe the collection of system information.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the operating system, hardware, and network configuration. This aligns with the description of the malware collecting detailed information about system properties.
   - **C: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook:** This technique involves exfiltrating data using webhooks. The question does not mention any data exfiltration, so this is not relevant.
   - **D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about web browsers. The question does not mention any browser information, so this is not relevant.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a malware that first evades detection by self-deleting on a specific date (T1070-Indicator Removal).
   - After evading detection, the malware collects detailed information about the system, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions.
   - The ATT&CK technique that best matches the collection of system information is T1082-System Information Discovery.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
