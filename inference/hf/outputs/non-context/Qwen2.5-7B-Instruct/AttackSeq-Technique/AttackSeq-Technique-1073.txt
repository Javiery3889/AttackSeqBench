Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described includes:
     - Executing shellcode through chained exploits.
     - Downloading and running 'dropper.dll'.
     - Implementing checks for security software to avoid detection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to allow malware backdoors to execute with system privileges.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system to identify potential vulnerabilities or to understand the environment. It does not directly relate to gaining or maintaining system privileges.
   - **B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher-level access or privileges. Given that the malware needs to execute with system privileges, this technique is highly relevant.
   - **C: T1546.016-Installer Packages**
     - This technique involves using installer packages to deploy malware. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the need for privilege escalation.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services to host or distribute malware. It does not directly relate to the need for privilege escalation on the target system.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question focuses on the need to execute malware with system privileges, which is a clear indication of a need for privilege escalation.
   - Among the given options, T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the need to gain higher-level access or privileges on the target system.

**Final Answer: B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**
