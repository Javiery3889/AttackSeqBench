To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Discovery**: The malware has already collected basic system and Bitcoin wallet information. This is part of the Discovery phase.
2. **Next Step**: The question asks for the technique that occurred before initiating logging activities like screen recording and keylogging.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1592.003-Firmware**: This technique involves modifying firmware to gain persistence or maintain access. It does not directly relate to the next step of logging activities.

B. **T1619-Cloud Storage Object Discovery**: This technique involves discovering and exfiltrating objects from cloud storage services. It is not directly related to the next step of logging activities.

C. **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots or video of the screen. This is a form of logging activity, which is mentioned as the next step after the initial discovery.

D. **T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves enumerating and reading system logs. This is also a form of logging activity, but it is more about reading existing logs rather than capturing new data in real-time.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible next step after collecting basic system and Bitcoin wallet information would be to start capturing real-time data, which aligns with screen capture (T1113).

**Final Answer: C: T1113-Screen Capture**
