To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Analysis of the Question:
- **Stuxnet evaded detection**: This indicates the use of rootkit functionality (T1059.002) and stolen digital certificates (T1216).
- **Communicated with C&C servers using encrypted HTTP**: This suggests the use of T1071.002 (Use of Encrypted Channels for C2).

### Answer Choices:
A. **T1542-Pre-OS Boot**: This technique involves modifying the boot process to gain persistence or privilege. While it can be part of an attack, it doesn't directly relate to the communication with C&C servers.

B. **T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**: This technique involves using voice-based phishing to deliver malware. It is not directly related to the communication with C&C servers using encrypted HTTP.

C. **T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves infecting shared content (e.g., documents, web pages) to deliver malware. While it can be used to spread malware, it doesn't directly relate to the communication with C&C servers.

D. **T1021.004-SSH**: This technique involves using Secure Shell (SSH) to establish a secure and encrypted connection. Given that the question mentions encrypted HTTP communication with C&C servers, this technique aligns well with the need for encrypted communication.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Rootkit and Stolen Certificates**: These are initial evasion techniques (T1059.002 and T1216).
2. **Encrypted HTTP Communication**: This is a technique for maintaining persistence and communication (T1071.002).
3. **SSH**: This is a method to establish an encrypted connection, which aligns with the need for encrypted communication with C&C servers.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the need for encrypted communication with C&C servers, is the use of SSH (T1021.004).

**Final Answer: D**
