To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where DeathStalker used malicious LNK files disguised as documents to gain entry into the victim's machine.
   - The TTPs involved are likely to be related to the initial compromise and the method used to deliver the payload.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection:** This technique involves collecting email addresses from local email clients. While it can be used to gather information for phishing campaigns, it does not directly describe the method of delivering a payload through LNK files.
   - **B: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves spreading malware through removable media. While it could be a method of delivery, the question specifically mentions LNK files, which are typically associated with network-based or email-based delivery rather than removable media.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service to host malicious content. While it can be used to deliver malware, it does not directly describe the use of LNK files.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into performing actions that result in the compromise of their systems. Malicious LNK files disguised as documents are a common form of social engineering, as they exploit the user's trust in documents and the system's handling of LNK files.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the LNK files were disguised as documents, which is a form of social engineering.
   - T1566-Phishing directly aligns with the use of social engineering to trick users into executing malicious files.
   - The other techniques (Local Email Collection, Replication Through Removable Media, and Web Service) do not directly describe the use of LNK files as documents.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
