Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where XAgent app collects information from an iOS device.
   - The next step in the sequence is uploading files via FTP to the C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs involved here are data collection and then file transfer using FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves convincing a user to execute a malicious payload. It does not directly relate to file transfer via FTP.
   - **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS** - This technique involves rapidly changing the IP addresses associated with a domain name to evade detection. It is not related to file transfer via FTP.
   - **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism** - This technique involves using legitimate system or application features to perform actions that would otherwise require elevated privileges. It does not directly relate to file transfer via FTP.
   - **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools or data from a remote system to a local system. While it can be used for various purposes, it is often associated with the transfer of malware or data to a local system, which can then be uploaded to a C2 server. This technique can be used to facilitate the file transfer via FTP.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where data is collected and then uploaded via FTP.
   - T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the most relevant technique as it involves the transfer of tools or data, which can include the process of uploading files via FTP to a C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
