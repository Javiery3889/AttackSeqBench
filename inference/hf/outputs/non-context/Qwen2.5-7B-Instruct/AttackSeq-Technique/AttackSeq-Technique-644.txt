Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that spear-phishing emails were used for initial access.
   - It then asks about the deployment of tools such as custom-built backdoors and publicly available Remote Access Tools (RATs).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial access is achieved through spear-phishing emails.
   - The next step is the deployment of tools to maintain access and control over the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates:** This technique involves using code signing certificates to sign malicious code, which is not directly related to the deployment of backdoors or RATs.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities:** This technique involves obtaining the ability to perform actions on a system, which could include deploying backdoors or RATs. This seems to align with the next step after initial access.
   - **C: T1491.001-Internal Defacement:** This technique involves defacing internal systems, which is not related to the deployment of backdoors or RATs.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to gain access, which is the initial step, not the deployment of tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing (T1566).
   - The next step is to deploy tools to maintain access and control, which aligns with T1588-Obtain Capabilities.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B
