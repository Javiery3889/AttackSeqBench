Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two specific TTPs:
     - A JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
     - Ensuring execution upon system startup using the Login1.vbs script.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. While it is related to executing commands, it does not specifically mention the use of a JavaScript downloader or a vbs script for autostart.
   - **B: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**
     - This technique involves modifying the Security Identifier (SID) history to evade detection. It does not align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
     - This technique involves using systemd timers to ensure that a process runs at a specific time or interval. While it is related to ensuring execution at startup, it is specific to systemd, and the question mentions a vbs script (Login1.vbs) for autostart, which is not systemd-related.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed at system boot or user logon. It aligns well with the use of the Login1.vbs script for ensuring execution upon system startup.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves using a JavaScript downloader to execute PowerShell commands and then ensuring execution upon system startup using a vbs script. The TTP that best fits the final step of ensuring execution upon system startup is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: D**
