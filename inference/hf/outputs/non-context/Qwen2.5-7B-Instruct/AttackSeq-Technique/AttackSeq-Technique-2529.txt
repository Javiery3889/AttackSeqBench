Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence where emails are first collected by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward incoming emails to an attacker-controlled email address.
   - The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of data, which is automated.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of collecting emails and then exfiltrating them.
   - **B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:** This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a network. It aligns well with the described sequence where data (in this case, emails) is collected and then exfiltrated automatically.
   - **C: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over an encrypted channel that is not a command and control (C2) protocol. While it could be a method of exfiltration, it does not specifically address the automation aspect mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1543.004-Launch Daemon:** This technique involves creating a launch daemon to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of collecting and exfiltrating emails.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1020-Automated Exfiltration, as it directly addresses the automated exfiltration of the collected emails.

Final Answer: B
