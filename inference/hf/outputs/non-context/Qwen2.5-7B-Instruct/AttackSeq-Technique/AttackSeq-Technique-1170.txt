Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has set up communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers using a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - The goal is to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key aspect here is the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication with C&C servers.
   - The objective is to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage:** This technique involves storing data in memory without writing it to the file system. While it can help in maintaining operational security, it does not directly address the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication.
   - **B: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This technique involves scheduling the transfer of data at a specific time. It does not directly relate to the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication.
   - **C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer:** This is a duplicate of B and can be disregarded.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encryption to secure communication channels. This directly aligns with the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication with C&C servers, which is aimed at maintaining operational security and avoiding detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1573-Encrypted Channel.

Final Answer: D
