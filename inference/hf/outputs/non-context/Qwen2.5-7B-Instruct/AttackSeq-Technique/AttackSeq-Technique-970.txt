To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor has already collected detailed host and network information.
   - The next step is to gather data on installed software as part of the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy** - This technique involves using an internal proxy to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to the discovery of installed software.
   - **B: T1069.003-Cloud Groups** - This technique involves using cloud services to manage or exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the discovery of installed software.
   - **C: T1518-Software Discovery** - This technique involves identifying and collecting information about software installed on the target system. This aligns with the next step in the sequence after collecting host and network information.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture** - This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. While it can be part of a broader reconnaissance, it is not directly related to the discovery of installed software.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor has already collected host and network information.
   - The next logical step in the discovery phase would be to gather information about the software installed on the system.
   - Among the given options, T1518-Software Discovery (C) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the next step in the sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery**
