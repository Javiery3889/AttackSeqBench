Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Emissary Panda used Active Scanning (T1595) to identify systems with vulnerabilities.
   - After identifying the vulnerabilities, the next step was to exploit CVE-2019-0604 on Microsoft SharePoint servers to gain initial access.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
     - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which is not directly related to the active scanning of vulnerabilities or exploiting a specific vulnerability.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols, which is not directly related to the active scanning of vulnerabilities or exploiting a specific vulnerability.
   - **C: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning networks or systems to identify open ports, services, or vulnerabilities. This aligns with the first step mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
     - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. This is not directly related to the active scanning of vulnerabilities or exploiting a specific vulnerability.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Active Scanning (T1595) -> Exploiting CVE-2019-0604.
   - The next step after Active Scanning (T1595) would be the exploitation of the identified vulnerability, which is directly followed by exploiting CVE-2019-0604.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: C: T1595-Active Scanning
