Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker (Earth Wendigo) steals username and password pairs via intercepted HTTPS POST requests to the webmail login API.
   - Before this, the attacker used a technique to evade detection by using indirect script execution through the webmail system's features.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves evasion of detection and then stealing credentials via intercepted POST requests.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves making files or information difficult to detect or understand. It does not directly relate to evasion through script execution.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts:** This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts on the system. It could be related to hiding the script or the evidence of its execution, but it doesn't directly address the use of indirect script execution.
   - **C: T1491-Defacement:** This technique involves modifying or destroying web content. It does not align with the scenario of using indirect script execution to evade detection.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not the one expected by the victim. While it is related to data exfiltration, it does not directly address the evasion of detection through script execution.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The most plausible technique for evading detection using indirect script execution would be one that involves hiding or manipulating the script in a way that it appears benign or normal to the system. This aligns most closely with the concept of hiding artifacts (T1564).

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
