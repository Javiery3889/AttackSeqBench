To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs after a BEC (Business Email Compromise) attempt was blocked, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The scenario involves a BEC attempt by London Blue, which was blocked by Agari Advanced Threat Protection.
   - After the block, the next step is to verify successful delivery of the email, which suggests a test email was sent.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1597-Search Closed Sources:** This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources. It does not directly relate to the scenario of verifying email delivery or subsequent actions after a BEC attempt.
   - **B: T1074.002-Remote Data Staging:** This technique involves the transfer of data to a remote system. It is not directly related to the verification of email delivery or the subsequent actions after a BEC attempt.
   - **C: T1578.001-Create Snapshot:** This technique involves creating a snapshot of the current state of a system or network. While it could be relevant in a broader context, it does not directly follow the sequence of verifying email delivery.
   - **D: T1656-Impersonation:** This technique involves the attacker pretending to be a legitimate user or entity. Given that the BEC attempt was blocked, the next logical step would be to try to impersonate a legitimate user to bypass the security measures in place.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The BEC attempt was blocked, indicating that the initial method of compromising the email was unsuccessful.
   - The next step would likely be to try another method to gain access or to impersonate a legitimate user to bypass the security measures.
   - T1656-Impersonation fits this scenario as it involves the attacker trying to mimic a legitimate user, which could be a follow-up tactic after the initial attempt was blocked.

**Final Answer: D: T1656-Impersonation**
