To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Explosive Trojan dynamically unloaded the Explosive DLL**: This suggests that the malware is capable of managing its own modules or components, which is a form of reflective code loading or similar techniques.

2. **Desired action was complete**: This implies that the malware has completed a specific task, which could be anything from data exfiltration to establishing persistence.

3. **Leveraging keylogging capabilities to obtain administrator passwords**: This is a clear indication of the malware's next step, which is to capture sensitive information.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves using multiple channels to communicate with the command and control server. While it is a valid TTP, it does not directly relate to the sequence of events described, which focuses on the completion of a task and then keylogging.

B. **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**: This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data. Again, this does not align with the sequence of events described, which involves the completion of a task and then keylogging.

C. **T1620-Reflective Code Loading**: This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to disk, which aligns with the description of the Explosive Trojan dynamically unloading the Explosive DLL. This is a plausible step before keylogging, as it suggests the malware is managing its own execution flow.

D. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding files, processes, and network connections to evade detection. While this is a common TTP, it does not directly relate to the sequence of events described, which focuses on the completion of a task and then keylogging.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Explosive Trojan dynamically unloaded the Explosive DLL (reflective code loading) and then leveraged keylogging capabilities to obtain administrator passwords.

Final Answer: C
