Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where corporate and personal email credentials are harvested through social media connections.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is facilitating movement within the target's networks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is harvesting credentials through social media.
   - The next TTP should logically be one that uses these credentials to move within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which is a preliminary step but not directly related to using the harvested credentials for network movement.
   - **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods, such as stolen credentials, to gain access to systems. This aligns well with the scenario of using harvested credentials to move within the network.
   - **C: T1547.015-Login Items**
     - This technique involves adding login items to a user's system to maintain persistence. While it can be used to facilitate access, it is more about maintaining access rather than the initial use of stolen credentials.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves deploying software to gain access or maintain access to a system. It is not directly related to using stolen credentials for network movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes harvesting credentials through social media, which is a form of gathering victim information (T1589).
   - The next step should be using these credentials to move within the network.
   - Among the given options, T1550 (Use Alternate Authentication Material) is the most relevant as it directly involves using the stolen credentials to gain access to systems and move within the network.

**Final Answer: B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
