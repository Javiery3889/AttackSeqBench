Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Elfin ensured persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file multiple times a day.
   - It also mentions the use of PowerShell commands to bypass logging on the infected machine.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning** - This technique involves the adversary scanning the network or host to identify new targets or gather information. This does not align with the persistence and logging evasion described in the question.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves placing malware in locations that are executed when the system boots or a user logs on. While this is related to persistence, it does not specifically mention the use of a scheduled task or PowerShell commands.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run malware at a later time. This aligns with the part of the question that mentions creating a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file.
   - **D: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain** - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to inject malicious code into legitimate software. This does not align with the persistence and logging evasion described in the question.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions creating a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file, which directly corresponds to the T1053-Scheduled Task/Job technique.
   - The use of PowerShell commands to bypass logging is a method to evade detection, which can be part of the broader persistence strategy but is not the primary TTP being asked about in the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
