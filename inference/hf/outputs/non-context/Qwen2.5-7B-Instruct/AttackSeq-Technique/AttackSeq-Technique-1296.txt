To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Spear-phishing emails or strategic Web compromises**: This indicates the initial access to the target system.
2. **Customized Poison Ivy server code being executed on the target system**: This suggests a post-exploitation activity where the attacker has gained a foothold and is now executing malicious code.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**: This technique involves using legitimate Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to establish a remote session. While this could be a method for post-exploitation, it is not directly related to the execution of a specific malicious payload like Poison Ivy.

B. **T1199-Trusted Relationship**: This technique involves exploiting a trusted relationship to gain unauthorized access. It is more about establishing a foothold rather than executing a specific payload.

C. **T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves using events to trigger the execution of malicious code. Given that the question mentions the execution of customized Poison Ivy server code, this technique aligns well with the need to trigger the execution of a specific payload.

D. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malicious content. While this is part of the initial access, the question is asking about the post-exploitation activity, not the initial access method.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the execution of a specific payload (Poison Ivy server code) after gaining initial access. Therefore, the technique that best fits this scenario is T1546-Event Triggered Execution.

Final Answer: C
