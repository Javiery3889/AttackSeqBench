Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attack sequence starts with ChromeLoader gaining initial access through a DMG containing a shell script.
   - We need to find the next step before the attacker establishes persistence with a Chrome browser extension.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1176-Browser Extensions**
     - This technique involves using a browser extension to establish persistence. Since the question asks for the step before establishing persistence with a Chrome browser extension, this is not the correct choice.
   - **B: T1547.008-LSASS Driver**
     - This technique involves injecting a driver into the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process to maintain persistence. This is a method of persistence but not directly related to browser extensions.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves creating a web service to maintain persistence. This is also a method of persistence but not directly related to browser extensions.
   - **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves compromising infrastructure to maintain access. This is a broader category and not specifically related to the next step in the sequence of establishing persistence with a Chrome browser extension.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question specifies that the next step after gaining initial access through a DMG containing a shell script is before establishing persistence with a Chrome browser extension. The most plausible step in this sequence would be a technique that directly leads to the creation of a persistent backdoor or access point, which is best represented by T1547.008-LSASS Driver.

**Final Answer: B: T1547.008-LSASS Driver**
