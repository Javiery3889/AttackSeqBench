To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely supported hiding the location of the 'mothership' server during the 'Red October' campaign, we need to analyze each option in the context of the question.

1. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line shells, scripts, or interpreters to execute commands. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly address the issue of hiding the location of a server.

2. **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**: This technique involves using a dead drop to exfiltrate or receive data. A dead drop is a method of communication where data is left in a hidden location for retrieval at a later time. This technique could be used to hide the location of the 'mothership' server by using a dead drop to communicate with it, making it difficult to trace the server's location.

3. **T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary. While this can help in hiding the true origin of the traffic, it does not directly address the issue of hiding the location of the 'mothership' server itself.

4. **T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**: This technique involves using a Windows logon helper DLL to execute code when a user logs on. This is more about executing code at logon and does not directly relate to hiding the location of a server.

Given the context of the 'Red October' campaign, which involved sophisticated espionage and the need to maintain operational security, the most plausible technique for hiding the location of the 'mothership' server would be one that allows for indirect and covert communication. The use of a dead drop to communicate with the server would make it difficult to trace the server's location.

**Final Answer: B (T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver)**
