To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - The question mentions that APT42 used methods like obfuscating files, process injection, and hidden windows to avoid detection. These are techniques that fall under the category of hiding artifacts and avoiding detection.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from tools used in the attack. While it is related to avoiding detection, it is more about cleaning up after the fact rather than the initial steps of hiding artifacts.
   - **B: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts. It does not directly relate to the methods of obfuscation, process injection, or hidden windows mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding files, processes, and network connections to avoid detection. This aligns closely with the methods of obfuscating files, process injection, and hidden windows mentioned in the question.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive communication to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not align with the methods of obfuscation, process injection, or hidden windows mentioned in the question.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes methods that are directly aimed at hiding and avoiding detection.
   - T1564-Hide Artifacts (Choice D) is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the methods of obfuscating files, process injection, and hidden windows.
   - The other choices (A, B, and C) do not align as closely with the described methods.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
