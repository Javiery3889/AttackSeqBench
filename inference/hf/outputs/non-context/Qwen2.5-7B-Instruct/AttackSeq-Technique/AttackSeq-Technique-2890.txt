Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The adversaries used 'ZwGetContextThread' and 'ZwSetContextThread' for thread context manipulation to discover process and thread information.
   - The next step in the sequence is the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols to communicate with their command and control server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1087-Account Discovery**
     - T1087 is related to the discovery of accounts, which is not directly related to thread context manipulation or network communication.
   - **B: T1012-Query Registry**
     - T1012 involves querying the Windows Registry, which is a common method for gathering information about the system but does not directly relate to thread context manipulation.
   - **C: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This is the same as B, so it is also not directly related to thread context manipulation or network communication.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - T1071 involves the use of application layer protocols (like HTTP and HTTPS) for command and control communication, which is the step mentioned as occurring after the thread context manipulation.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the thread context manipulation (T1003) is followed by the use of HTTP and HTTPS (T1071) for communication.
   - None of the choices A, B, or C directly fit the sequence as they do not align with the thread context manipulation step.
   - Choice D (T1071) is the most plausible as it directly follows the thread context manipulation step and aligns with the use of HTTP and HTTPS for communication.

**Final Answer: D**
