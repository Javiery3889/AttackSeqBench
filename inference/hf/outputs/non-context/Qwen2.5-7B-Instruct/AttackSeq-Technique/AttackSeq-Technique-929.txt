To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The question mentions Volatile Cedar's exploitation of server vulnerabilities to inject web shell code.
   - It asks which technique most likely occurred before the group used compromised web servers for gaining initial access to internal networks.

2. **Analyzing Each Option:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves using removable media to spread malware or exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to the initial access or exploitation of server vulnerabilities.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning networks to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities. It is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where attackers scan networks to find exploitable vulnerabilities.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories:** This technique involves gathering data from publicly available or internal information repositories. While it can be part of reconnaissance, it is not directly related to the initial access or exploitation of server vulnerabilities.
   - **D: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning:** This technique involves using a list of words or phrases to identify potential credentials or other sensitive information. It is a method of brute-forcing or guessing credentials, which is not directly related to the initial access or exploitation of server vulnerabilities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the group used compromised web servers for gaining initial access to internal networks. This implies that the group first needed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web servers.
   - **T1595-Active Scanning** (B) is the most logical choice because it involves scanning networks to find exploitable vulnerabilities, which would precede the exploitation of those vulnerabilities to inject web shell code.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, where the group first scans for vulnerabilities and then exploits them, aligns with **T1595-Active Scanning**.

Final Answer: B
