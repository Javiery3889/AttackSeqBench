Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Agrius exploited FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 to upload webshells for lateral movement.
   - The next step is registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service to achieve persistence.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions:** This technique involves modifying file or path exclusions to evade detection. It does not directly relate to the steps mentioned in the question.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain command and control (C2) communications. While it is a common technique, it is not directly related to the steps mentioned.
   - **C: T1059.008-Network Device CLI:** This technique involves using a network device command-line interface to execute commands. It is not directly related to the steps mentioned.
   - **D: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves modifying system services to maintain persistence. This aligns with the step of registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Agrius first uses a vulnerability to upload webshells and then registers a backdoor as a service to achieve persistence.
   - The technique that directly relates to registering a backdoor as a service is T1569-System Services.

**Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services**
