To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Bvp47 established connections to external systems and initiated communication, we need to analyze the sequence of TTPs and their typical order in an attack lifecycle.

1. **T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves the attacker using external remote services to gain access to a system. This could be a plausible initial step, but it is more about the means of establishing a connection rather than the initial access itself.

2. **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a system through a malicious website or drive-by download. This is a common method for initial access, where the attacker exploits a vulnerability in a user's web browser or a web application to gain control of the system.

3. **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system. This is a step that could occur after initial access but is not typically the first step in establishing initial access.

4. **T1550.001-Application Access Token**: This technique involves the attacker using a stolen or misused access token to gain elevated privileges. This is a step that would occur after initial access has been established, not as the initial access itself.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible initial access technique that would precede the establishment of connections to external systems and the initiation of communication would be a method that directly leads to the compromise of the system, allowing the attacker to then use Bvp47 to establish connections and communicate.

**Final Answer: B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
