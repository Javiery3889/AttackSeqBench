To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before GreyEnergy utilized spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers for initial access to target energy companies and critical infrastructure, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it could be a step in the attack chain, it is more likely to occur after initial access rather than before the initial access methods are employed.

2. **T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's network and systems. This is a crucial step before using spearphishing or compromising public-facing web servers, as it helps the attackers understand the target's environment and identify vulnerabilities.

3. **T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography, which is more relevant to maintaining persistence or exfiltrating data rather than the initial access phase.

4. **T1590.004-Network Topology**: This technique involves understanding the network topology of the target. While it is important for the attackers to understand the network structure, it is more likely to be a step that occurs after initial access to ensure the attackers can navigate the network effectively.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be gathering information about the target before employing the initial access methods. Therefore, the technique that best fits this description is T1592-Gather Victim Host Information.

**Final Answer: B: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
