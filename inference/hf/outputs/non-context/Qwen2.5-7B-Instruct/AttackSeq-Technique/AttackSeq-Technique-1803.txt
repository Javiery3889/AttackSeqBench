Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where configuration files are encoded using single-byte XOR keys, and this is done to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.
   - The key point here is the encoding of configuration files, which suggests a form of data manipulation or obfuscation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries** - This technique involves adding malicious entries to the autostart mechanisms of a system to ensure persistence. It does not directly relate to encoding configuration files.
   - **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service (DoS)** - This technique involves disrupting network services, which could be a consequence of the encoded configuration files, but it does not directly describe the encoding process.
   - **C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood** - This technique involves overwhelming the operating system with requests to exhaust resources. While it could be a result of the disruption, it does not directly describe the encoding process.
   - **D: T1590.001-Domain Properties** - This technique involves manipulating domain properties to redirect traffic or perform other actions. It does not directly describe the encoding of configuration files.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions encoding configuration files, which is a form of data manipulation.
   - None of the provided techniques directly describe the encoding of configuration files.
   - However, the most plausible technique that could lead to the disruption of websites through the manipulation of configuration files is a form of data manipulation or obfuscation, which is not explicitly listed in the provided options.

Given the options, none of them directly describe the encoding of configuration files. However, if we consider the closest match, it would be a technique that could lead to the disruption of websites, which is most closely related to network manipulation or DoS.

**Final Answer: B: T1498-Network Denial of Service** (Although it does not directly describe the encoding, it is the closest match in terms of disrupting network services, which could be a result of the encoded configuration files.)
