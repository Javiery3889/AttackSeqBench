Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Regin gathered information on processes, memory utilization, and monitored network traffic.
   - It then asks which technique occurred before capturing credentials by analyzing network traffic.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1560.002-Archive via Library**
     - This technique involves archiving data using a library. It does not directly relate to gathering information on processes, memory utilization, or network traffic.
   - **B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic. While it is related to network traffic, it is not mentioned as a step before capturing credentials.
   - **C: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
     - This technique involves accessing LSASS memory to capture credentials. This is the step after gathering information and monitoring network traffic.
   - **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering network connections. It aligns with the monitoring of network traffic and is a logical step before capturing credentials by analyzing network traffic.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the technique should occur after gathering information on processes, memory utilization, and monitoring network traffic, and before capturing credentials by analyzing network traffic.
   - T1049-System Network Connections Discovery (D) fits this sequence as it involves discovering network connections, which is a step that would logically precede analyzing network traffic for credential capture.

**Final Answer: D**
