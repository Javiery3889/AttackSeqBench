Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.
   - The goal is to identify which ATT&CK technique enabled them to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Webshells (T1566.001):** These are malicious scripts that can be uploaded to a web server to provide a backdoor for the attacker.
   - **Tunneling RDP Traffic:** This suggests that the attacker is using webshells to route RDP traffic through a different channel, likely to avoid detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attacker is moving from one system to another within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages:** This technique involves using chat messages to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the use of webshells and tunneling RDP traffic.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence and avoid detection. While it could be used in conjunction with webshells, it does not directly enable remote exploitation of systems.
   - **C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system. Webshells and tunneling RDP traffic are methods of exploiting remote services, making this a strong candidate.
   - **D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares:** This technique involves using administrative shares to gain access to a system. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly enable the tunneling of RDP traffic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the use of webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement is T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.

Final Answer: C
