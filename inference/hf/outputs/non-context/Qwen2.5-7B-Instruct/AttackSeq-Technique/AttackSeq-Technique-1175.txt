To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attacker has already exploited vulnerable services to gain initial access. This is a prerequisite for the subsequent steps.

2. **Maintaining Access**: The question asks which technique was used to maintain access before deploying custom malware like WellMess or WellMail for command and control.

3. **Deploying Custom Malware**: The attacker then deploys custom malware (WellMess or WellMail) for command and control, which suggests a need for persistence and possibly lateral movement.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1137.002-Office Test**: This technique involves using Microsoft Office applications to test for vulnerabilities. It does not directly relate to maintaining access or deploying malware.

B. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. While it can be used for initial access, it is not typically used for maintaining access or deploying malware.

C. **T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**: This technique involves using multiple identities to blend in with legitimate users and services. It can be used for maintaining access and evading detection, but it is more about identity management rather than directly maintaining access.

D. **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid user accounts to perform actions on the network. It is commonly used to maintain access by leveraging existing credentials, which can be used to move laterally and maintain persistence.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for maintaining access before deploying custom malware is T1078-Valid Accounts, as it directly addresses the need to maintain access using legitimate credentials.

**Final Answer: D**
