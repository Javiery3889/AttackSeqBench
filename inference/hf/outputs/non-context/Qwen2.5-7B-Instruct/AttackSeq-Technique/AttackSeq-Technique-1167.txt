Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence starts with the implantation of malware through a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
   - This is followed by the use of Longhorn (a technique for secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection).

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique involves the use of default accounts, which is not directly related to the secure erase protocols or the zero-day exploit mentioned.
   - **B: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique involves using voice-based spearphishing, which is not aligned with the use of a Word document exploit or secure erase protocols.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware, which is somewhat related to the initial zero-day exploit in a Word document but does not follow the secure erase protocols.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise, which aligns well with the secure erase protocols mentioned (renaming and overwriting to avoid detection).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The secure erase protocols (renaming and overwriting) are a method to remove evidence of the malware and avoid detection. This aligns closely with the T1070-Indicator Removal technique, which focuses on removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
