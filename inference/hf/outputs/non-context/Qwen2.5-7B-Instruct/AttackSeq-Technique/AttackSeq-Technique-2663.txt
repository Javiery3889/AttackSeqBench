Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Korplug collects data from local and networked drives and gathers system information.
   - The next step in the sequence is encrypted communication with fallback C&C (Command and Control) servers for further interaction.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned are data collection and system information gathering, followed by encrypted communication with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique involves communication that can be initiated by both the attacker and the victim. However, it does not specifically mention encryption or fallback C&C servers.
   - **B: T1027.003-Steganography**
     - This technique involves hiding data within other data. While it can be used for communication, it does not specifically address encrypted communication with C&C servers.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
     - This technique involves accessing data from network shared drives, which aligns with the initial data collection step but does not address the encrypted communication with C&C servers.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for communication. It can be used to establish encrypted communication with C&C servers, which aligns with the requirement for encrypted communication and fallback mechanisms.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant because it directly addresses the use of application layer protocols, which can include encrypted communication.
   - The other techniques (T1102.002, T1027.003, and T1039) do not specifically address the encrypted communication aspect or the fallback C&C server requirement.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
