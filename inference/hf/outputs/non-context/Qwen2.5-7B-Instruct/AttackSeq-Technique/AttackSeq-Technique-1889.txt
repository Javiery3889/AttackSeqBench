To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique that occurred after FIN13 leveraged custom passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE to establish a local HTTP server for incoming requests, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the described attack sequence.

1. **T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves the use of malicious links to deliver malware or other malicious content. While it is a common technique, it does not directly relate to the establishment of a local HTTP server for incoming requests, which is the focus of the question.

2. **T1505-Server Software Component**: This technique involves the attacker using a legitimate server software component to host malicious content or services. Given that the question mentions a local HTTP server established for incoming requests, this technique aligns well with the scenario of hosting malicious content or services on the victim's own infrastructure.

3. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the use of command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the establishment of a local HTTP server for incoming requests.

4. **T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: This technique involves the use of messaging applications to exfiltrate data or deliver commands. It does not directly relate to the establishment of a local HTTP server for incoming requests.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that occurred after the establishment of a local HTTP server for incoming requests is T1505-Server Software Component, as it directly addresses the hosting of malicious services on the victim's infrastructure.

Final Answer: B: T1505-Server Software Component
