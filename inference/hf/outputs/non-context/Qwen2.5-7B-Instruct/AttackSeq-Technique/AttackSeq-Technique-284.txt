To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions "Dropping Elephant used spear-phishing emails with exploit documents for initial access." This aligns with the T1566.001 technique, which involves using malicious documents in spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.

2. **Bypassing Detection**: The question states that the attackers "employed encoded blobs to bypass detection for downloading additional malware." This suggests a technique that involves encoding or obfuscating the malware to avoid detection, which could be related to T1027.001 (Obfuscation) or T1027.002 (Encryption).

3. **Downloading Additional Malware**: The question implies that after bypassing detection, the attackers download additional malware. This could be a variety of techniques, but the question does not specify the exact method.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1059.011-Lua**: This technique involves using Lua scripts to execute commands. While it could be used for post-exploitation activities, it does not directly align with the sequence of TTPs described.

B. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. It is a broad category and could be relevant for post-exploitation activities but does not specifically fit the sequence described.

C. **T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts. While it could be used for post-exploitation activities, it does not directly align with the sequence of TTPs described.

D. **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. While it could be used for post-exploitation activities, it does not directly align with the sequence of TTPs described.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP that fits the sequence of initial access (spear-phishing with exploit documents) and then downloading additional malware (after bypassing detection with encoded blobs) is not directly listed in the choices. However, the closest and most relevant technique that could be inferred from the provided choices is one that involves post-exploitation activities, such as T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, which could be used to execute commands or scripts to download additional malware.

Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
