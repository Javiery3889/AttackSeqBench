Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor is used to collect data and communicate with a C&C server using a specific protocol.
   - The key aspect here is ensuring the data transmission with the C&C server is secure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using encryption to secure the communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. This directly addresses the need for secure data transmission.
   - **B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure** - This technique is about hiding the infrastructure used for command and control (C&C) communications, which is not directly related to securing the data transmission.
   - **C: T1005-Data from Local System** - This technique involves exfiltrating data from the local system, which is a step in the process but does not address the security of the data transmission.
   - **D: T1542.004-ROMMONkit** - This technique involves using a ROMMON (Read Only Memory Remote Monitor) backdoor, which is a method of gaining access to a device but does not address the security of the data transmission.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically asks about ensuring the data transmission with the C&C server is secure.
   - Among the given options, only T1573-Encrypted Channel (A) directly addresses the security of the data transmission channel.
   - The other options either do not pertain to securing the data transmission (B and D) or are about collecting data (C).

**Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
