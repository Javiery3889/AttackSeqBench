Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that UNC1945 established persistence by placing a copy of a legitimate `pam_unix.so` file and the SLAPSTICK backdoor in the `/lib64/security` folder.
   - It also mentions that they used a custom ELF utility called `LOGBLEACH` to clean logs, which is an anti-forensics technique.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a publicly facing application. There is no indication in the question that UNC1945 exploited a public-facing application.
   - **B: T1216.001-PubPrn**
     - This technique involves using a public printer to exfiltrate data. There is no mention of a public printer in the question.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise. While `LOGBLEACH` is an anti-forensics technique, it specifically targets log files, which is a subset of indicator removal. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the anti-forensics step.
   - **D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run at a later time. Establishing persistence by placing a backdoor in a system's security folder (like `/lib64/security`) is a form of persistence, which can be achieved through scheduled tasks or other means. However, the question does not specify that a scheduled task was used.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The persistence technique (placing a backdoor in `/lib64/security`) is a form of persistence that can be achieved through various means, including scheduled tasks. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the anti-forensics step.
   - `T1070-Indicator Removal` (C) is the most specific and relevant technique mentioned in the question, as it directly addresses the use of `LOGBLEACH` to clean logs, which is an anti-forensics technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
