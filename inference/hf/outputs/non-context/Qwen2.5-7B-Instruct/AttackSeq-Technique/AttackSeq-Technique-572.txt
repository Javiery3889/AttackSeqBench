Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Sofacy first registered new domain names mimicking legitimate organizations and then used phishing techniques to steal credentials.
   - The focus is on the technique that enabled the registration of new domain names.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise** - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors. It does not directly relate to the registration of new domain names.
   - **B: T1584.003-Virtual Private Server** - This technique involves using a VPS to host malicious content or infrastructure. It does not directly relate to the registration of new domain names.
   - **C: T1606-Forge Web Credentials** - This technique involves creating or modifying web credentials to gain unauthorized access. It does not directly relate to the registration of new domain names.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly relate to the registration of new domain names.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is asking for the technique that enabled the registration of new domain names, which is a preparatory step for the phishing campaign.
   - None of the provided techniques directly address the registration of new domain names.
   - However, the closest technique that could be indirectly related to the registration of new domain names is T1584.003-Virtual Private Server, as it involves hosting infrastructure, which could include the registration of new domain names.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - While none of the provided techniques directly address the registration of new domain names, T1584.003-Virtual Private Server is the most plausible choice as it involves hosting infrastructure, which could include the registration of new domain names.

Final Answer: B
