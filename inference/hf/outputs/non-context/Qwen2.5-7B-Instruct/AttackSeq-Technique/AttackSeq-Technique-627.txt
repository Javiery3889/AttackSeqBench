To determine which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to gain access to the victim system before the malware executed its backdoor by rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the described sequence of TTPs.

1. **T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands through an intermediary, which could be used to execute malware indirectly. However, it does not directly describe a method of gaining initial access to a system.

2. **T1560.001-Archive via Utility**: This technique involves using a utility to archive files, which is not directly related to gaining initial access to a system or executing malware.

3. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. Phishing is a common method for gaining initial access to a system, which aligns well with the scenario where malware is rewritten to the %Temp% folder after gaining access.

4. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access. While this can be a method of gaining access, it is more specific to exploiting software vulnerabilities rather than a general method of gaining access through social engineering or other means.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, where the malware is rewritten to the %Temp% folder after gaining access, the most plausible initial access technique would be one that involves social engineering or user interaction, such as phishing.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
