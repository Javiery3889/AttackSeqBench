To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the answer choices.

1. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - The attacker has modified open-source hacking tools for defense evasion.
   - The attacker is maintaining a presence on the network with Backdoor.Pirpi.
   - The goal is to gather credentials.

2. **Answer Choices Evaluation**:
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to capture credentials. While it is a plausible method, it is more direct and less stealthy compared to other methods.
   - **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**: This technique involves modifying or injecting code into authentication modules to capture credentials. It is a sophisticated method but might be more complex to implement than other options.
   - **C: T1110.003-Password Spraying**: This technique involves using a list of common or stolen passwords to try to gain access to multiple accounts. It is a common and effective method for credential gathering.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into providing their credentials by mimicking a trusted entity. It is a widely used and effective method for credential gathering.

3. **Reasoning**:
   - Given that the attacker is already maintaining a presence on the network with a backdoor (Backdoor.Pirpi), it suggests a level of persistence and stealth.
   - Password spraying (T1110.003) is a method that can be highly effective and is often used in conjunction with other techniques to bypass security measures.
   - Phishing (T1566) is also a common method but might be less stealthy compared to other techniques, especially when the attacker is already on the network.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attacker's presence and the goal of gathering credentials, is likely to be T1110.003-Password Spraying, as it aligns well with the attacker's persistence and the need to gather credentials without necessarily needing to bypass more complex security measures.

Final Answer: C
