Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication.
   - It evades detection.
   - It establishes communication with the C2 server through HTTP requests with PNG files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media (like USB drives) to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the use of HTTP and PNG files for communication.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using web services for command and control (C2) communication. It aligns with the use of HTTP for communication, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
     - This technique involves using non-standard or covert signaling in network traffic to evade detection. While it aligns with the evasion aspect, it does not specifically mention HTTP or PNG files.
   - **D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions. It does not align with the use of HTTP and PNG files for communication.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - ZoxPNG uses HTTP for communication, which is directly mentioned in the question.
   - The use of PNG files for HTTP requests is a specific method of obfuscation and evasion.
   - T1102-Web Service (B) is the most relevant technique as it directly involves the use of web services (HTTP) for C2 communication, which aligns with the described method of using HTTP requests with PNG files.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
