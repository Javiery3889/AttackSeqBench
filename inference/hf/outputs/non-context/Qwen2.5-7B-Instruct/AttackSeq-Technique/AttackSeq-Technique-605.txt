To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
2. **Subsequent Action**: After gaining initial access, the adversaries deployed public domains like `teamtnt[.]red` to build their cyber infrastructure for resource development.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1565-Data Manipulation**
- This technique involves modifying data in a way that is intended to be undetectable. It does not align with the sequence of actions described, as it does not involve the initial access or the deployment of infrastructure.

**B: T1595-Active Scanning**
- This technique involves scanning networks or systems to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities. While it could be a step before exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports, it is not directly related to the deployment of public domains for resource development.

**C: T1590.002-DNS**
- This technique involves the use of DNS to perform malicious activities, such as domain generation algorithms or DNS tunneling. It could be relevant to the deployment of public domains like `teamtnt[.]red`, but it does not directly address the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports.

**D: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching**
- This technique involves using the `sudo` command to gain elevated privileges or using the `sudo` cache to maintain persistence. While it could be a step after gaining initial access, it does not directly address the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports or the deployment of public domains.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports, which is a form of network scanning or service exploitation.
2. **Subsequent Action**: After gaining initial access, the adversaries deployed public domains like `teamtnt[.]red` to build their cyber infrastructure.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible TTPs are related to the initial access and the subsequent deployment of infrastructure. The technique that best fits the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports is **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**, which is not listed in the choices but is closely related to exploiting a service exposed to the internet.

However, among the given choices, **T1595-Active Scanning** (Choice B) is the closest to the initial access via misconfigured Docker API ports, as it involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which could lead to the exploitation of the misconfigured Docker API.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
