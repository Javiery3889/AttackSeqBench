Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the Inception attackers used anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process. This implies that the attackers are trying to hide their tracks and prevent detection.
   - The specific anti-forensics technique mentioned is the prevention of clues from being left on disk or in the registry.

2. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions to install malware. While it can be part of a broader attack, it does not directly address the anti-forensics aspect of hiding clues on disk or in the registry.
   - **B: T1137-Office Application Startup**
     - This technique involves modifying the registry to ensure that malicious code is executed when an Office application starts. It does not directly relate to hiding clues or anti-forensics.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal on Host**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from the host system, which aligns with the anti-forensics aspect of hiding clues on disk or in the registry.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain elevated privileges or execute malicious code. It does not directly address the anti-forensics aspect of hiding clues.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions anti-forensics techniques to prevent clues from being left on disk or in the registry.
   - Among the given options, T1070-Indicator Removal on Host (C) is the most relevant as it directly addresses the removal of indicators, which is a form of anti-forensics.

**Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal on Host**
