To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Attack Vector**: The OilRig actors used a malicious macro with a decoy invoice document. This is a form of social engineering and phishing, which is covered by the T1566-Phishing technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Payload Installation**: After the initial attack vector, the actors silently installed the ISMAgent payload. This step involves the execution of a payload, which could be related to T1202-Indirect Command Execution, but it is more likely to be related to T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools, as it involves the installation of a tool that could be used to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Evasion Techniques**: To minimize suspicion, the actors would likely employ techniques to avoid detection. This could include disabling or modifying tools that might be used to detect or remove the payload, which aligns with T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools.

4. **Command History Logging**: While T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging is a technique to avoid detection, it is not directly related to the installation of the payload or the initial attack vector described.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible sequence is:

1. Phishing (T1566) to deliver the malicious macro.
2. Installation of the ISMAgent payload (likely related to T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools to avoid detection).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is best represented by the answer choice that includes T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools.

Final Answer: C: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools
