To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the attack attributed to ShadowPad, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack involves the use of a backdoor that is executed via DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred for the attackers to gain access to the victim's network before executing the backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain persistence and avoid detection. However, it does not directly pertain to gaining initial access to the network.
   - **B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice** - This technique involves using voice calls to deliver malicious content. It is not typically associated with the initial network access or the use of DLL hijacking.
   - **C: T1187-Forced Authentication** - This technique involves forcing the victim to authenticate to a malicious server. While it can be used to gain access, it is not directly related to the use of DLL hijacking in a legitimate application.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to the network. This aligns well with the scenario where the attackers use DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application, which is a form of exploiting a public-facing application.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers need to gain access to the victim's network before they can use DLL hijacking in a legitimate application.
   - Exploiting a public-facing application (T1190) is a common method for gaining initial access to a network.
   - Once the attackers have gained access to the network, they can then use DLL hijacking in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application to execute their backdoor.

**Final Answer: D**
