Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Malware evading detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker.
     - Using InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, to evade suspicion.
     - Executing the payload via proxy execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious content. It does not align with the use of a trusted utility and proxy execution.
   - **B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
     - This technique involves reducing the number of possible keys to make brute-force attacks more feasible. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding payloads in non-standard ways to evade detection. While it could be part of a broader evasion strategy, it does not directly align with the use of a trusted utility and proxy execution.
   - **D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**
     - This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute malicious code. InstallUtil.exe is a trusted .NET utility, and proxy execution is a method to run code in a less suspicious manner. This aligns perfectly with the described sequence of TTPs.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware uses a trusted utility (InstallUtil.exe) to evade detection and then executes its payload via proxy execution.
   - Among the given options, T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution (D) is the only one that directly matches this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: D**
