To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving decoding base64-encoded blobs based on system architecture.
   - It then mentions the decryption of the KerrDown payload using DES and its execution in memory.

2. **Identifying the Sequence:**
   - The base64 decoding step suggests that the malware or payload was initially encoded in a way that required decoding.
   - The use of DES for decryption indicates that the payload was encrypted using DES.
   - The execution in memory implies that the payload was not written to disk but was loaded directly into the memory for execution.

3. **Evaluating Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
     - This technique involves using reversible encryption to obfuscate malware. It fits the context of the payload being encrypted (DES) and then decrypted.
   - **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or malware into the target environment. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the decryption and execution steps.
   - **C: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process to execute it. While it fits the execution in memory part, it does not address the initial encoding and decryption steps.
   - **D: T1087.003-Email Account**
     - This technique involves using email accounts to transfer malware. It is not directly related to the described sequence of actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The base64 decoding and DES encryption suggest that the malware was initially encoded and encrypted.
   - The most relevant technique that aligns with the described sequence is T1556.005-Reversible Encryption, as it directly addresses the use of reversible encryption (base64 and DES) to obfuscate the malware.

**Final Answer: A: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
