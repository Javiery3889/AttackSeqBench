To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Analysis of the Question:
- The question describes a sequence where Taidoor malware communicates with its C2 servers using HTTP and RC4 encryption, with the victim's MAC address as a key for encrypted data exchange.
- This implies that the malware has already established a foothold and is now communicating with its C2 server using a specific encryption method and key.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
- **Description**: This technique involves the use of protocols other than those used for application-layer communication (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communications.
- **Relevance**: While this technique could be relevant for the communication aspect, it does not directly address the use of HTTP and RC4 encryption or the use of the victim's MAC address as a key.

**B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
- **Description**: This technique involves the use of encryption to secure communications between the attacker and the victim.
- **Relevance**: This technique is directly related to the use of encryption (RC4) for the communication with the C2 server. However, it does not specifically mention the use of the victim's MAC address as a key.

**C: T1485-Data Destruction**
- **Description**: This technique involves the attacker deleting or corrupting data on the victim's system.
- **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the communication or encryption methods described in the question.

**D: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
- **Description**: This technique involves the attacker using domain controller authentication to gain access to the network.
- **Relevance**: This technique is more about gaining initial access and authentication rather than the specific communication and encryption methods described in the question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access**: The question does not mention the initial access technique, so we can assume that the malware has already gained access to the system.
2. **Encryption and Communication**: The question specifies that the malware uses HTTP and RC4 encryption, and the victim's MAC address as a key.
3. **Relevance to Techniques**:
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the use of encryption (RC4) for communication.
   - **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol** is relevant to the communication method but does not address the encryption or keying method.
   - **T1485-Data Destruction** and **T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication** are not relevant to the described communication and encryption methods.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described in the question, is the use of encryption for communication, which aligns with the T1573-Encrypted Channel technique.

Final Answer: B
