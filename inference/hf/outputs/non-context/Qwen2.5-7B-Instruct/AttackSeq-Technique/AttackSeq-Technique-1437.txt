To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Analysis of the Question:
The question mentions that the ProjectM actors developed a toolset including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs (Remote Access Tools) for their campaigns. This implies that the actors had already gained a foothold or access to the target environment and were then able to deploy their tools.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities**
- This technique involves the exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain access to a system. It is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks, where the attackers exploit a vulnerability to gain initial access to a network or system.
- This technique logically precedes the development and deployment of tools, as the attackers need to gain access before they can use tools.

**B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
- This technique involves the attackers setting up or acquiring infrastructure to support their operations, such as command and control (C2) servers.
- While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs after the initial access has been gained, as the attackers need to have a foothold to establish their infrastructure.

**C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
- This technique involves the attackers copying and modifying legitimate files to create a backdoor or other malicious code.
- This is a step that can occur after initial access but is more about maintaining persistence and evading detection rather than gaining access.

**D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
- This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to a system.
- Similar to T1588.006, this is a method of gaining initial access, but it is more specific to exploiting applications rather than general vulnerabilities.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers need to gain initial access to the target environment. This is the most critical and foundational step.
2. **Toolset Development**: Once initial access is gained, the attackers can then develop and deploy their toolset, including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, where the initial access is gained before the toolset is developed, is best represented by the exploitation of vulnerabilities (T1588.006).

**Final Answer: A: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities**
