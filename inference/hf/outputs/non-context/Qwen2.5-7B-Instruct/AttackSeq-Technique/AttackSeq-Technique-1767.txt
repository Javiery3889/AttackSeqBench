Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where sensitive data (keystrokes, clipboard contents, and browser cookies) is collected.
   - The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of this data to a remote malicious web server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are data collection techniques (T1003 for keystrokes, T1110 for clipboard contents, and T1112 for browser cookies).
   - The next step is the exfiltration of this data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1218.002-Control Panel** - This technique involves using the Control Panel to gather information about the system. It is not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with a remote server. This is a plausible method for securely exfiltrating data to a remote server.
   - **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling** - This technique involves using network traffic to signal the presence of an attacker. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery** - This technique involves discovering information about the browser. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs for securely exfiltrating the collected data to a remote malicious web server is using an encrypted channel.
   
Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
