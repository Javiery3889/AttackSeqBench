To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique for the described sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Delivering the FriarFox malicious Firefox browser extension via a phishing email**: This step is the initial compromise and is not directly related to the ATT&CK technique we are evaluating.

2. **Establishing capabilities for defense evasion**: This step involves techniques to avoid detection by security systems, which could include various ATT&CK techniques such as T1027 (Security Server Emulation) or T1096 (Proxy).

3. **Contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload**: This step involves the extension communicating with a remote server to download additional malicious content. The technique that best fits this action is T1071 (Application Layer Protocol), as it describes the use of application layer protocols to establish a command and control (C2) channel.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. While this could be relevant for the communication, it is more about the method of communication rather than the protocol used.

- **B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternative authentication mechanisms to gain access to systems. This is not directly related to the communication with a server to retrieve a payload.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to establish a C2 channel. This directly aligns with the described action of the extension contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

- **D: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking a service session to gain unauthorized access. This is not directly related to the communication with a server to retrieve a payload.

Given the analysis, the most plausible ATT&CK technique for the described sequence of TTPs is T1071 (Application Layer Protocol).

Final Answer: C
