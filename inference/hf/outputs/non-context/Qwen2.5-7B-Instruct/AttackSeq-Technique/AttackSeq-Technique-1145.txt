To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Spear-Phishing Emails with Obfuscated URLs**: This is a common initial attack vector where the adversary uses social engineering to deliver a malicious payload via email. This aligns with the initial step in the attack sequence.

2. **Delivery of Malicious Payloads**: After the spear-phishing emails, the next step is the delivery of the malicious payload. This is where the TTPs in the answer choices come into play.

3. **Evasion of Defense Mechanisms**: The final step mentioned is the evasion of defense mechanisms using DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations. This indicates that the payload needs to bypass security measures.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1218.004-InstallUtil**: This technique involves using the InstallUtil.exe tool to install a malicious payload. While it can be used to install a payload, it does not directly align with the evasion of defense mechanisms using DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

- **B: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the Windows Task Scheduler to run a malicious payload. Again, it does not directly align with the evasion of defense mechanisms using DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to deliver a malicious payload. While it can be used to deliver a payload, it does not directly align with the evasion of defense mechanisms using DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules to execute code. This can be used in conjunction with DLL side-loading, which is mentioned in the question as a method to evade defenses. Custom XOR operations can also be used to obfuscate the payload, making it harder to detect.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible answer is the one that aligns with the use of shared modules (DLL side-loading) and custom XOR operations for evasion.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
