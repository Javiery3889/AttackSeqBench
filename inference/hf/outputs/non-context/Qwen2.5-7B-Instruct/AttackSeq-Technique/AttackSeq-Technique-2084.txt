Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence where RIG EK fetches malware using an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - The malware is then transmitted securely using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to exfiltrate data or to establish a command and control (C2) channel.
     - The use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for encryption aligns well with this technique.
   - **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
     - This technique is about using non-standard or unexpected traffic patterns to signal the presence of a C2 channel.
     - It does not directly address the encryption of the data being transmitted.
   - **C: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves modifying the system's search order to load malicious code instead of legitimate code.
     - It does not relate to the secure transmission of exploit code.
   - **D: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 traffic.
     - It does not directly address the encryption of the data being transmitted.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1573-Encrypted Channel, as it directly addresses the secure transmission of exploit code using encryption.

Final Answer: A
