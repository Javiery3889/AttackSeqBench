To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Suckfly used the Nidiran back door**: This indicates the initial access to the victim's network.
2. **Signed with stolen digital certificates**: This suggests the use of a trusted method to execute malicious code, likely to evade detection.
3. **Infect the victim's internal hosts**: This implies the deployment of malware or other malicious software to gain a foothold.
4. **Scanning the internal network for open ports**: This is a common technique to discover new targets and expand the attack surface.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**: This technique involves identifying cloud services that can be used for lateral movement or data exfiltration. It does not directly relate to the scanning of internal network ports or expanding the foothold.

B. **T1552.008-Chat Messages**: This technique involves using chat applications to exfiltrate data or communicate with the attacker. It does not align with the scanning of internal network ports or expanding the foothold.

C. **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which can be used to move laterally within the network. This aligns well with the need to scan for open ports and expand the foothold.

D. **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the attacker, which is a common method to avoid detection. However, it does not directly relate to the scanning of internal network ports or expanding the foothold.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible technique that occurs after infecting the internal hosts and before scanning for open ports is T1003-OS Credential Dumping, as it provides the necessary credentials to move laterally and scan for new targets.

Final Answer: C
