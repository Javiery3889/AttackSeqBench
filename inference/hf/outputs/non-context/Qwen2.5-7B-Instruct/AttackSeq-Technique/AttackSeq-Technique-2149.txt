Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware achieved persistence using a RunOnce key in the registry.
   - The next step is establishing command and control by injecting into a process through Process Hollowing.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique is about achieving persistence, which is the first step mentioned in the sequence. It does not fit as the next step after persistence.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating processes to find a suitable host for injection. This would logically follow the persistence step and precede the injection step.
   - **C: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**
     - This technique is about discovering trust relationships within a network, which is not directly related to the process injection or command and control steps.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This is the same as B, and it fits the sequence as the next step after persistence and before injection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Both B and D are the same, and they both fit the sequence correctly. However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence, and both choices are identical, we can conclude that either is correct.

Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery (or D: T1057-Process Discovery)
