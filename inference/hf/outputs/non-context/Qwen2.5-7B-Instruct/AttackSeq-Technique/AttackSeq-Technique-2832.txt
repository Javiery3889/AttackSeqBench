To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before BlackSoul utilized obfuscation techniques in its loader and retrieved components from the Cloudflare Workers service, let's analyze each option in the context of the described sequence of TTPs.

1. **T1542.002-Component Firmware (A)**: This technique involves the use of firmware components. It is not directly related to the retrieval of components from a web service or the use of obfuscation techniques in a loader. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

2. **T1569.002-Service Execution (B)**: This technique involves the execution of a service, which could be a step in the process of running a loader. However, it does not specifically address the retrieval of components from a web service or the use of obfuscation techniques.

3. **T1204-User Execution (C)**: This technique involves the execution of code or programs by a user. While it is a step in the execution process, it does not directly address the retrieval of components from a web service or the use of obfuscation techniques.

4. **T1102-Web Service (D)**: This technique involves the use of a web service to perform actions, such as retrieving data or executing code. Given that BlackSoul retrieved components from the Cloudflare Workers service, this technique directly aligns with the described action.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
- The question describes a sequence where BlackSoul first utilized obfuscation techniques in its loader and then retrieved components from a web service.
- T1102-Web Service (D) directly addresses the retrieval of components from a web service, which is a critical step in the described sequence.
- The other techniques (T1542.002, T1569.002, and T1204) do not specifically address the retrieval from a web service or the use of obfuscation techniques in the loader.

**Final Answer: D**
