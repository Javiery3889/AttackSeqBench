Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Korplug malware has already gathered system information and network details.
   - The next step in the sequence is to enable the malware to access and collect data from shared resources within the target's network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware has already performed system and network information gathering (T1082-System Information Discovery).
   - The next step is to access shared resources, which implies the malware needs to interact with network shares.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1555.002-Securityd Memory:** This technique involves accessing memory to retrieve security-related information. It does not directly relate to accessing shared resources.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique is already mentioned in the question and refers to gathering system and network details, not accessing shared resources.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive:** This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive, which aligns with the next step of the malware's activity after gathering system and network information.
   - **D: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository:** This technique involves accessing configuration data from a repository, which is not directly related to accessing shared network resources.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already gathered system and network information.
   - The next logical step is to access shared resources, which would involve interacting with network shares.
   - T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive is the most relevant technique for accessing shared resources within the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
