To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with the use of WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to execute commands remotely for lateral movement.
   - The next step is to gather information on network configuration, which is a critical step to support operational objectives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery:** This technique involves identifying active network connections. While it is related to network discovery, it does not specifically focus on system network configuration.
   - **B: T1505-Server Software Component:** This technique involves using software components that are part of the target's infrastructure. It does not directly relate to network configuration.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the target system, which aligns with the question's requirement to gather information on network configuration.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts:** This technique involves using default accounts, which is not directly related to gathering network configuration information.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of WMI for lateral movement suggests that the attackers have already gained access to a system and are moving laterally within the network.
   - The next step is to gather information on the network configuration, which is essential for further operations.
   - Among the given options, T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery (C) is the most relevant as it directly addresses the need to gather network configuration information.

**Final Answer: C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
