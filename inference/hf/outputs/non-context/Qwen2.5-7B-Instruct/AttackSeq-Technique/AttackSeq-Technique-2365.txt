Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with spear-phishing attacks targeting sectors in the Middle East.
   - After gaining initial access, the next step involves processing requests between clients and the C2 server to support payload delivery and information collection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The spear-phishing attack is a method of gaining initial access.
   - The next step involves communication between the compromised client and the C2 server, which is used for payload delivery and information collection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure** - This technique is about hiding the infrastructure used for command and control (C2) communications. It does not directly relate to the processing of requests between the client and the C2 server.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing** - This technique is about the use of phishing to deliver malware. Since the question already mentions spear-phishing, this is not the next step.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. This aligns well with the processing of requests between the client and the C2 server.
   - **D: T1584.006-Web Services** - This technique involves the use of web services for C2 communications. While it could be relevant, it is more specific to web services, and T1071 is a broader category that encompasses various application layer protocols.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of processing requests between the client and the C2 server, is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
