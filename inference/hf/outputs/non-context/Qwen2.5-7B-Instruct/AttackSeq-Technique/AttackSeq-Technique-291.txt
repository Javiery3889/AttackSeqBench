To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Question Analysis:**
   - The attack sequence involves using a backdoor to steal Google Chrome credentials.
   - After stealing the credentials, pings to the C2 server are transmitted at regular intervals.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The backdoor is used to steal credentials.
   - Regular pings to the C2 server are sent after the credentials are stolen.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery** - This technique involves identifying and using permission groups to gain access to resources. It does not directly relate to stealing credentials or pinging a C2 server.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise** - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website. While it can lead to the installation of a backdoor, it does not directly relate to the pinging of a C2 server.
   - **C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage** - This technique involves accessing data stored in cloud services. It does not directly relate to stealing credentials or pinging a C2 server.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection** - This technique involves collecting data automatically, often in the background, without user interaction. This could be used to gather the stolen credentials and then transmit them to the C2 server at regular intervals.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor is used to steal Google Chrome credentials (implying a data collection step).
   - The stolen credentials need to be transmitted to the C2 server.
   - The most plausible technique for automating the collection and transmission of the stolen data is T1119-Automated Collection.

5. **Final Answer:**
   Final Answer: D
