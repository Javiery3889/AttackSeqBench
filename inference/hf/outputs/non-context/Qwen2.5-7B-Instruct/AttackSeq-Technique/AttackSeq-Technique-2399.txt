To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Discovery Activities**: The attackers performed discovery activities to gather task lists, directory listings, and system information. This aligns with the following ATT&CK techniques:
   - **T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about running processes, which can include task lists and system information.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, which can include directory listings and system information.

2. **Execution of Commands**: The attackers executed commands to discover system network connections. This aligns with the following ATT&CK technique:
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about network connections on the system.

3. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - The question states that the discovery activities were followed by the execution of commands to discover system network connections. Therefore, the sequence should be from discovery activities to the execution of commands.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery** and **T1082-System Information Discovery** are both forms of discovery activities.
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** is the execution of commands to discover network connections.

4. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This is the execution of commands to discover network connections, which comes after the discovery activities.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique is about establishing an encrypted channel for command and control, which is not directly related to the sequence of discovery and network connection discovery.
   - **C: T1057-Process Discovery**: This is a form of discovery activity, but it does not follow the execution of commands to discover network connections.
   - **D: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**: This technique involves searching for information on victim-owned websites, which is not directly related to the sequence of discovery and network connection discovery.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is from discovery activities to the execution of commands to discover network connections. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery
