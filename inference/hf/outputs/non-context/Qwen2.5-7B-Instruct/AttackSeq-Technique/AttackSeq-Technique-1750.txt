To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Discovery using in-memory execution of tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit**: This indicates reconnaissance and information gathering, likely to identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

2. **TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on an IIS request validation function**: This suggests that after reconnaissance, the attacker has gained a foothold and is now establishing a method to maintain persistent access, likely through a web-based attack vector.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager**: This technique involves stealing credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. While this could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly align with the establishment of command and control via an IIS request validation function.

B. **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or misrepresenting indicators of compromise. While this could be a step to avoid detection, it doesn't directly align with the establishment of command and control via an IIS request validation function.

C. **T1563.002-RDP Hijacking**: This technique involves hijacking an RDP session. While this could be a method to gain initial access, it doesn't directly align with the establishment of command and control via an IIS request validation function.

D. **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using alternate authentication material, such as tokens or hashes, to gain access. This could be a method to maintain persistence and establish command and control, especially through web-based vectors like IIS request validation functions.

Given the context of establishing command and control via an IIS request validation function, the most plausible TTP is one that involves maintaining persistence and using alternate authentication material, which aligns with T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material.

**Final Answer: D**
