Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for credential dumping.
   - They cleared log files to conceal their activity.
   - They executed processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Credential dumping: This is a technique to obtain sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
   - Clearing log files: This is a technique to cover their tracks and avoid detection.
   - Executing processes on remote computers: This is a technique to spread the malware or maintain persistence across the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact:** This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact. It does not align with the propagation of processes on remote computers.
   - **B: T1080-Taint Shared Content:** This technique involves infecting shared content to spread malware. While it can be used for propagation, it does not directly align with the execution of processes on remote computers.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services:** This technique involves using remote services to establish a connection to a remote system. It aligns well with the execution of processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.
   - **D: T1583.004-Server:** This technique involves using a server to facilitate the attack. While it can be part of the propagation, it does not directly describe the execution of processes on remote computers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1021-Remote Services, as it directly aligns with the execution of processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
