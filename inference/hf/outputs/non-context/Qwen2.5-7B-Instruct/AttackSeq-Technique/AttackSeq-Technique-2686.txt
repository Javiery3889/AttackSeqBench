Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - KiraV2 periodically receives commands from the C&C server to execute DDoS attacks.
   - It uses hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers for communication with the C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question implies that KiraV2 initially used hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers for communication with the C&C server. This suggests a method to obfuscate or hide the communication channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
     - This technique involves using a ticket to gain access to a resource or service. It does not directly relate to the use of hard-coded IP addresses or encoded port numbers for communication.
   - **B: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
     - This technique involves establishing a one-way communication channel, which does not necessarily imply the use of hard-coded IP addresses or encoded port numbers.
   - **C: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate its meaning. This aligns with the use of encoded port numbers, which is a form of data encoding to hide the communication.
   - **D: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service**
     - This technique involves causing a denial of service on an endpoint. It does not directly relate to the use of hard-coded IP addresses or encoded port numbers for communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the use of hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers for communication, which is a method to obfuscate the communication channels.
   - Among the given choices, T1132-Data Encoding (C) is the most relevant as it directly involves encoding data, which can include port numbers.

**Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding**
