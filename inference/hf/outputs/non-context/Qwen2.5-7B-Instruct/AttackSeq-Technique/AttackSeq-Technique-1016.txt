To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Obfuscated Files and Information**: This suggests that the attackers used techniques to hide or disguise their malicious files or scripts, making them harder to detect.

2. **Deactivating Security Mechanisms in Microsoft Office**: This indicates that the attackers took steps to disable or bypass security features in Microsoft Office, likely to ensure their obfuscated files could run without being detected.

3. **Backdoors Automatically Listed Interesting Files for Exfiltration**: This implies that after the backdoors were installed, they were configured to identify and prepare files for exfiltration.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1112-Modify Registry**: This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to persistently maintain access or to evade detection. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of obfuscation and deactivation of security mechanisms.

B. **T1574.005-Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness**: This technique involves exploiting file permissions to execute malicious code. It is more about the initial delivery and execution of the payload rather than the steps that follow the deactivation of security mechanisms.

C. **T1055.015-ListPlanting**: This technique involves planting a list of files or directories to be exfiltrated. This aligns well with the step where backdoors are configured to automatically list interesting files for exfiltration.

D. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of obfuscation and deactivation of security mechanisms.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible step that follows the deactivation of security mechanisms and precedes the automatic listing of files for exfiltration is the planting of a list of files to be exfiltrated.

**Final Answer: C**
