To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app, let's analyze the sequence of events and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from hiremilitaryheroes[.]com. This is a classic phishing technique, which is described in ATT&CK as T1566-Phishing.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**: The question asks which technique most likely occurred before the initial access. Therefore, we need to find a technique that would precede the act of tricking users into downloading a fake app.

3. **Evaluate Each Option**:
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which is not directly related to the initial act of tricking users into downloading a fake app.
   - **B: T1222-File and Directory Permissions Modification**: This technique involves changing file and directory permissions, which is also not directly related to the initial act of tricking users into downloading a fake app.
   - **C: T1659-Content Injection**: This technique involves injecting content into a legitimate application or website, which is not directly related to the initial act of tricking users into downloading a fake app.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into performing an action that results in the compromise of their system, such as downloading a malicious app. This is the most direct precursor to the initial access described in the question.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the phishing attack (T1566) occurred before the initial access by downloading a fake app.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
