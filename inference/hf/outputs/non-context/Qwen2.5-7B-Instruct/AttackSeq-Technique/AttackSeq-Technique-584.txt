Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have gained credential access using Mimikatz and Impacket tools.
   - They then used webshells to dump credentials and execute commands on other systems within the network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Gaining credential access (T1003).
   - Using webshells (T1021.007).
   - Dumping credentials (T1003.004).
   - Executing commands on other systems (T1059).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**
     - This technique is related to collecting email addresses and other information from local systems, which does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a process to gain control or hide malicious activity. While it could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly align with the described sequence.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using remote services to establish a foothold on a system. T1021.007 is a sub-technique that specifically mentions using webshells, which aligns with the described use of webshells.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services to establish a foothold. It does not align with the described use of webshells and dumping credentials on the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1021.007-Remote Services (webshells).

Final Answer: C
