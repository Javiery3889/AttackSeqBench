To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Discovery of Interesting Files**: The question mentions that Gamaredon discovered interesting files, such as Office documents, on a system for future exfiltration. This suggests that the attackers are looking for specific types of files that could be valuable for their purposes.

2. **Exfiltration**: The question states that the files are for future exfiltration, meaning the attackers plan to move these files to a remote location.

3. **Scanning for Sensitive Files**: The question also mentions that the malware scans all drives and removable media for sensitive files. This is a later step in the attack sequence, after the initial discovery and exfiltration of the interesting files.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the attacker using a local system to gather data. While this could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't specifically align with the sequence of discovering interesting files and preparing for exfiltration.

B. **T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**: These are scripting languages that can be used to automate tasks. While they could be used in the attack, they don't directly relate to the sequence of discovering and preparing to exfiltrate specific files.

C. **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves the attacker using a custom method to archive data. This could be a plausible step after discovering interesting files and before exfiltration, as it would involve compressing or archiving the files for easier transfer.

D. **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves the attacker using native APIs to perform actions. While this could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't specifically align with the sequence of discovering and preparing to exfiltrate specific files.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that fits the step of archiving the discovered files for exfiltration is **T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**.

Final Answer: C
