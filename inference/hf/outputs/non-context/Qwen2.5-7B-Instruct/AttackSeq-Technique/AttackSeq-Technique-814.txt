Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware is deployed through malicious websites linked in spear phishing emails.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing connections to the attacker's infrastructure using domains to evade network detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves the use of malicious websites and spear phishing emails to deliver malware.
   - The next step is establishing connections to the attacker's infrastructure, which is described as using domains to evade network detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing:** This technique is already mentioned in the question and describes the initial phase of the attack. It does not describe the next step of establishing connections.
   - **B: T1001.002-Steganography:** This technique involves hiding data within other data to evade detection. It does not directly relate to establishing connections using domains.
   - **C: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:** This technique involves using a dead drop (a method of communication where information is left in a hidden location) to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to establishing connections using domains.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a connection to the attacker's infrastructure. This aligns with the question's description of using domains to evade network detection, as application layer protocols can be used to establish covert channels.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: D
