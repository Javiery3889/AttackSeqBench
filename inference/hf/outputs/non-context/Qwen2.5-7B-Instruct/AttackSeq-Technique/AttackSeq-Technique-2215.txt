Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     - Compressing files using WinRAR.
     - Uploading the archive to the Mega service using the megacmd tool.
   - The question asks about the communication technique used to avoid detection during the interaction with compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to avoid detection by network monitoring tools. This could be a plausible method to avoid detection.
   - **B: T1137.002-Office Test**
     - This is not a valid ATT&CK technique. It seems to be a typo or misinterpretation of a technique.
   - **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or avoid detection. It does not directly relate to communication methods.
   - **D: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media for communication, which is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the communication aspect to avoid detection.
   - T1571-Non-Standard Port is the only technique that directly addresses communication methods and could be used to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.

**Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
