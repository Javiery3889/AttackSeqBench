Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs starts with the loading of the Kingslayer backdoor via the malicious 'Alpha' software subversion.
   - The next step is the evasion of detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The loading of the backdoor via a malicious software subversion is already given.
   - The next step is the evasion of detection, which is achieved through a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1219-Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves the use of remote access software, which is not directly related to the loading of the backdoor or the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
   - **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
     - This technique involves using domain controller authentication to gain access. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly relate to the loading of the backdoor or the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
   - **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
     - This technique involves using polymorphic code to evade detection. Polymorphic code can change its appearance each time it runs, making it difficult to detect. This aligns well with the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm, which is a method to evade detection by sleeping at specific times.
   - **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
     - This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly relate to the loading of the backdoor or the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is the use of polymorphic code to evade detection, which aligns with the diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
   
Final Answer: C
