Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes the execution of VBA macros, writing the 'network.js' file, and modifying the registry.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique would ensure that NanHaiShu remains active across system reboots.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when the system boots up or when a user logs on. This is directly related to maintaining persistence across reboots.
   - **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking the Component Object Model (COM) to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not directly related to ensuring the malware remains active across reboots.
   - **C: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to a text storage site. It is not related to maintaining persistence.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves gathering information about the system. It is not related to maintaining persistence.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the malware needs to remain active across system reboots. This implies a need for persistence.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is specifically designed to ensure that malware is executed at boot or logon, which directly addresses the need for persistence.

**Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
