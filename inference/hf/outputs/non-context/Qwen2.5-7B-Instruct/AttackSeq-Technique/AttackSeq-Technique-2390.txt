Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack began with a spear-phishing email containing a trojanized legitimate software installer. This is a common initial access technique.

2. **Discovery Activities**: The question specifies that the malware then performed discovery activities such as collecting system, network, and task information on the victim host. This is a typical behavior of malware to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before the malware performed these discovery activities. The techniques listed are:
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves identifying network connections and services on the host.
   - **T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim host, which aligns with the discovery activities mentioned.
   - **T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which is a step that could occur after initial access and before detailed discovery.
   - **T1136.002-Domain Account**: This technique involves using domain accounts, which is more about gaining access to specific accounts rather than discovery.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This is a specific type of discovery but not the most general or likely to occur before other discovery activities.
   - **T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**: This is a broad technique that encompasses the collection of various types of information, which aligns well with the described discovery activities.
   - **T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**: While this is a discovery technique, it is more specific and typically occurs after a more general information gathering phase.
   - **T1136.002-Domain Account**: This is more about gaining access to accounts rather than discovery.

Given the need to identify a technique that most likely occurred before the malware performed the detailed discovery activities, the most plausible choice is the one that broadly covers the collection of various types of information.

**Final Answer: B: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
