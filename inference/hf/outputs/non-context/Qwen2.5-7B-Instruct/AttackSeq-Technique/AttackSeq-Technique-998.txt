To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Exfiltration Stage**: The question mentions that the exfiltration stage was completed using the SmartFTP Client. This indicates that the attacker used a tool to transfer data out of the network.

2. **Disabling Protections**: After exfiltration, the attacker disabled protections. This could involve disabling security software, firewalls, or other security measures to facilitate further actions.

3. **Deploying RYUK Ransomware**: Finally, the attacker deployed the RYUK ransomware, which is a type of malware designed to encrypt files and demand a ransom for their release.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1127.001-MSBuild**: This technique involves using the MSBuild tool to create and deploy malicious code. While it is a valid technique, it does not directly relate to the exfiltration stage or the deployment of ransomware.

B. **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to cause impact, which aligns with the deployment of RYUK ransomware. However, it does not directly relate to the exfiltration stage or the disabling of protections.

C. **T1495-Firmware Corruption**: This technique involves corrupting firmware to gain persistence or maintain access. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration stage or the deployment of ransomware.

D. **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to perform actions that are not easily detected by security software. This could be used to disable protections, which aligns with the sequence of disabling protections after exfiltration.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence would involve disabling protections after exfiltration, which aligns with the use of native APIs to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: D**
