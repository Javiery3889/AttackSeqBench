Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two TTPs:
     1. The attacker used a scheduled task for persistence.
     2. The attacker executed a VBA macro using the 'mshta.exe' tool to download and execute a malicious dropper.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique is directly mentioned in the question as the first step. It involves using a scheduled task to ensure the execution of malicious code.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves network-level attacks to gain access or manipulate network traffic. It is not directly related to the use of a scheduled task or executing a VBA macro.
   - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves using valid user accounts to gain access to the system. It is not directly related to the use of a scheduled task or executing a VBA macro.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious files. While it could be a method to deliver the initial payload, it is not directly related to the use of a scheduled task or executing a VBA macro.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question asks which technique most likely occurred before executing a VBA macro using 'mshta.exe'. Given that the scheduled task is already mentioned as the first step, we need to find a technique that could precede the use of a scheduled task.
   - **T1566-Phishing (D)** could be a plausible method to deliver the initial payload that sets up the scheduled task. However, it is not directly related to the execution of the VBA macro.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts (C)** could be used to gain access to the system, but it is not directly related to the execution of the VBA macro.
   - **T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay (B)** is a network-level attack and is not directly related to the execution of the VBA macro.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence would be that the attacker used a phishing attack (T1566) to deliver the initial payload, which then set up the scheduled task (T1053) to ensure the execution of the VBA macro.

**Final Answer: D**
