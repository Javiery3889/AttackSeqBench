To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated APT28's secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor component advstoreshell.dll, we need to analyze the context and the nature of the communication method.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions APT28, a known APT group.
   - It specifies that the backdoor component advstoreshell.dll was deployed during data collection.
   - Secure communication with C&C servers is the goal.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves the use of system services to maintain persistence or execute code. It does not directly address secure communication.
   - **B: T1071.001-Web Protocols:** This technique involves the use of web protocols for command and control. While it could be a method of communication, it is not specifically about secure communication.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain secure communications. This is directly relevant to the secure communication aspect of the question.
   - **D: T1218.014-MMC:** This technique involves the use of Management of Management Console (MMC) for command and control. It is not specifically about secure communication.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT28 is known for using sophisticated methods to maintain secure and stealthy communication with their C&C servers.
   - The question specifically asks about secure communication, which aligns with the use of encrypted channels.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel (T1573) is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the secure communication aspect.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
