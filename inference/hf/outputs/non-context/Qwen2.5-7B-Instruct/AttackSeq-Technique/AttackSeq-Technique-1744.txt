To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice step-by-step.

1. **Maintaining Persistence through NodeIISWeb Malware:**
   - This indicates that the malware has established a foothold on the system and is likely to be running in the background.

2. **TG1021 Demonstrated Significant Efforts to Avoid Detection:**
   - This suggests that the actor is actively trying to evade detection mechanisms, including commercial Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools and logging mechanisms.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to hide malicious activity. While it can be used to avoid detection, it does not directly relate to maintaining persistence through NodeIISWeb malware.
   
   - **B: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
     - This technique involves creating an Event Filter and Event Consumer in WMI to execute code in response to specific events. It can be used for persistence and to avoid detection by monitoring system events. However, it is more about event handling rather than directly avoiding detection by EDRs.
   
   - **C: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
     - This technique involves adding entries to the Windows Autostart locations to ensure that malware starts automatically when the system boots. This is a common method for maintaining persistence. After maintaining persistence, the actor might then focus on avoiding detection.
   
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access to the system. While it can be used to initially gain access, it does not directly relate to maintaining persistence through NodeIISWeb malware or avoiding detection by EDRs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be maintaining persistence first (NodeIISWeb malware) and then focusing on avoiding detection (T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries).

Final Answer: C
