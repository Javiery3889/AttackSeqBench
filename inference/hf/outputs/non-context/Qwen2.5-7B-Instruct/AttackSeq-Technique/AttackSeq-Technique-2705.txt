Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the Aurora malware gained initial access through a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6. This is a known method of initial access.

2. **Installation Process**: The malware then installs a second service pointing to a backdoor DLL. This indicates that the malware is performing persistence by creating a new service that will run the backdoor DLL.

3. **Persistence Technique**: The creation of a new service to run the backdoor DLL is a form of persistence. The most relevant ATT&CK technique here is T1569-System Services, which involves creating or modifying system services to maintain access.

4. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1059.011-Lua**: This technique involves using Lua to execute code. It is not directly related to the creation of a service.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or misrepresenting indicators of compromise. It is not directly related to the creation of a service.
   - **C: T1569-System Services**: This technique directly involves creating or modifying system services to maintain access, which aligns with the described action.
   - **D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**: This technique involves using administrative shares to move laterally or gain access. It is not directly related to the creation of a service.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:

Final Answer: C: T1569-System Services
