To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that WINDSHIFT APT gained initial access by sending emails mimicking legitimate password recovery or reset requests from platforms such as Gmail or Apple iCloud. This is a form of phishing, which is covered by the T1598-Phishing for Information technique.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**: After gaining initial access through phishing, the next step would typically involve the adversary attempting to leverage this access to perform further actions, such as modifying the authentication process or executing commands.

3. **Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**: This technique involves changing the authentication process to gain unauthorized access. This could be a plausible next step after gaining initial access through phishing.
   - **B: T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious payload. While this could be a step in the attack, it is more likely to occur after the adversary has already gained some level of access.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands. This could also be a step after gaining access, but it is more specific than the general modification of the authentication process.
   - **D: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves using phishing to obtain information. Since the initial access has already been achieved, this is not the next step.

4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the initial access through phishing, would be to modify the authentication process to ensure continued access and maintain control over the compromised system.

Final Answer: A: T1556-Modify Authentication Process
