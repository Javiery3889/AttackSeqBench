Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions achieving persistence through HKCU autorun system registry keys Run and RunOnce.
   - It then asks about transmitting encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's organization. It does not align with the described TTPs of persistence and data transmission.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. HTTP POST requests are an application layer protocol, which fits the described TTP of transmitting data via HTTP POST requests.
   - **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using non-application layer protocols for C2 communications. Since the question specifies HTTP POST requests, which are application layer protocols, this does not fit.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves executing malware at system boot or logon. While it aligns with the persistence aspect (Run and RunOnce), it does not address the data transmission part of the question.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly addresses the method of data transmission via HTTP POST requests.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
