Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Establishing Persistence**: The question mentions that the attacker has already established persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into explorer.exe to maintain the Poison Ivy server process. This aligns with the T1543.003 - In-Process Injection technique.

2. **Securing Communication**: The next step is to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP. This implies that the attacker is looking to ensure that the communication between the client and the server is not easily detected or intercepted.

3. **Reviewing the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**: This technique involves requesting multi-factor authentication from a user, which is not relevant to securing network communication.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which could be a method to secure communication, but it is not specifically about creating an encrypted channel.
   - **C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves executing code based on an event, which is not directly related to securing communication.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to secure the communication channel, which directly aligns with the need to secure communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

Given the context of securing communication with a custom network protocol over TCP, the most relevant and plausible technique is T1573-Encrypted Channel.

**Final Answer: D**
