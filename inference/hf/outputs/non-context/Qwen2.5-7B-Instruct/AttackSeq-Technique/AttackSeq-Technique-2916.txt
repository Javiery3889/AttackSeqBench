To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice.

1. **Question Context**: The question mentions that the attack sequence starts with the AtomBombing technique, which is used for defense evasion. After this, the attack exploits atom tables to achieve execution.

2. **Understanding AtomBombing**: AtomBombing is a technique that involves manipulating atom tables to inject malicious code into a process. This technique is often used to bypass certain security measures and achieve persistence or execution.

3. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - **Before AtomBombing**: The attack must have a technique that sets up the environment for AtomBombing. This could involve process injection or using native APIs to manipulate the process space.
   - **After AtomBombing**: The attack uses AtomBombing to inject malicious code, which then achieves execution.

4. **Evaluating Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1542.003-Bootkit**: This technique involves using a bootkit to gain persistence. While it can be used for defense evasion, it does not directly set up the environment for AtomBombing.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a process. This is a strong candidate as it can be used to set up the environment for AtomBombing.
   - **C: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native APIs to achieve persistence or execution. While it can be used for defense evasion, it does not directly set up the environment for AtomBombing.
   - **D: T1546.016-Installer Packages**: This technique involves using installer packages to achieve persistence. It is not directly related to setting up the environment for AtomBombing.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attack first uses a technique to inject code into a process, which then allows the use of AtomBombing to inject malicious code and achieve execution.

**Final Answer: B: T1055-Process Injection**
