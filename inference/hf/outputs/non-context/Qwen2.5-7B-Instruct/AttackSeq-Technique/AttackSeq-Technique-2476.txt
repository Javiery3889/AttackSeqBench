To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated access to victim systems before exploiting CVE-2021-40444 and using PowerShell for the Empire stager, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1566-Phishing (A)**: Phishing is a common method to gain initial access to a system. Attackers often use phishing emails or malicious websites to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malware. This technique is a plausible method to gain initial access before exploiting a vulnerability.

2. **T1189-Drive-by Compromise (B)**: This technique involves compromising a website or web application to deliver malicious content to visitors. While this can be a method to gain access, it is less likely to be the initial step compared to phishing, which is more direct and often used to trick users into taking specific actions.

3. **T1556.004-Network Device Authentication (C)**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in network devices to gain access. While this could be a method to gain access, it is not as common or direct as phishing for gaining initial access to a system, especially in the context of client-side exploitation.

4. **T1136-Create Account (D)**: This technique involves creating a new account on a system. While this can be a method to gain access, it is typically a step that occurs after initial access has been gained, rather than the initial method of gaining access.

Given the context of the attack sequence, where the initial step involves exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) and then using PowerShell for the Empire stager, the most plausible method to gain initial access would be through a technique that directly targets users to trick them into providing access or downloading malware.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
