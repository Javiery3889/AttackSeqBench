Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is:
     1. Leveraging keylogging capabilities to gain administrator passwords.
     2. Utilizing writable mass storage devices for USB infection to spread across the network.
   - We need to identify which technique most likely occurred before the USB infection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking an SSH session, which is not directly related to keylogging or USB infection.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not directly relate to keylogging or USB infection.
   - **C: T1216.001-PubPrn**
     - This technique involves using public printers to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to keylogging or USB infection.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system. Keylogging to gain administrator passwords could be a result of exploiting a remote service, such as a vulnerable web application or service.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The keylogging to gain administrator passwords is likely a result of exploiting a remote service, which is a common initial attack vector.
   - After gaining access, the attackers would then use writable mass storage devices (USB infection) to spread across the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first exploited a remote service to gain access, which led to keylogging to obtain administrator passwords, and then used writable mass storage devices to spread across the network.

Final Answer: D
