Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - APT42 used spear phishing to gain initial access.
   - They bypassed MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
   - They engaged in credential harvesting.
   - They used lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Spear phishing (initial access)
   - Bypassing MFA
   - Credential harvesting
   - Using lightweight tools and custom backdoors

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate**
     - This technique involves installing a root certificate to intercept and manipulate HTTPS traffic. It is not directly related to the credential harvesting or the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
   - **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
     - This technique involves developing custom tools and capabilities, which aligns with the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors mentioned in the question.
   - **C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**
     - This technique involves using social media accounts to gather information, which is not directly related to the credential harvesting or the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
   - **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
     - This technique involves using spear phishing to deliver malware or other malicious content. While it is related to the initial access via spear phishing, it does not directly address the credential harvesting or the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that complements the credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors is the development of custom capabilities.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is B: T1587-Develop Capabilities.

Final Answer: B
