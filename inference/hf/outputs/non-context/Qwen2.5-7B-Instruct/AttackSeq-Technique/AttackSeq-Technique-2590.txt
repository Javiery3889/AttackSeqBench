Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware gathers system information and sends it to a C&C server.
   - It then mentions that the malware establishes communication with the C&C server using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser.

2. **Identify the Key Elements:**
   - Gathering system information and sending it to a C&C server: This aligns with the initial reconnaissance and command and control (C2) activities.
   - Establishing communication using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser: This indicates the use of a specific protocol or method to communicate that is not typical and may be designed to evade detection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1136.003-Cloud Account**
     - This technique involves using cloud storage services to exfiltrate data. It does not directly relate to establishing communication with a C&C server using a specific protocol.
   - **B: T1205.001-Port Knocking**
     - This technique involves establishing a connection by sending packets to specific ports in a particular order. While it can be used for C2, it does not specifically mention mimicking a browser.
   - **C: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the target's systems to evade detection. It does not directly relate to establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish a C2 channel. The question mentions mimicking a Firefox browser, which is an application layer protocol. This aligns well with the use of a specific protocol to establish communication.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of an application layer protocol to establish communication with the C&C server, mimicking a Firefox browser.

Final Answer: D
