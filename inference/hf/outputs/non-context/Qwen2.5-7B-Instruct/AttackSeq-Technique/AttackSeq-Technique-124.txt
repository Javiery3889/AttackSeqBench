To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Initial Deployment of Wipers**: The question mentions the deployment of wipers such as 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD'. These are tools used for destructive actions, which aligns with the intent to cause damage to the target's systems.

2. **Use of 'IPsec Helper' Backdoor**: Agrius used the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP. This indicates that the attacker has established a means to control and coordinate further actions on the compromised system.

3. **Further Actions**: The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial setup. We need to consider what actions would logically follow the establishment of a backdoor for further coordination.

**Answer Choices Analysis**:

- **A: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**: This technique involves using the `regsvcs` or `regasm` command to load and register .NET assemblies. While this can be used for persistence or execution of malicious code, it does not directly follow the use of a backdoor for coordination.

- **B: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood**: This technique involves flooding a service with requests to consume resources. While it can be a destructive action, it is more about overwhelming a service rather than coordinating further actions.

- **C: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to render it unusable. Given that the initial deployment was destructive, and the backdoor was used for coordination, it is plausible that the attacker would encrypt data to further impact the system.

- **D: T1021-Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to perform actions on the target system. Given that the backdoor was used for communication with C2 servers, it is logical that the attacker would use remote services to coordinate further actions.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attacker has established a backdoor for communication.
2. The next logical step would be to use the established communication channel to coordinate further actions.
3. Among the options, T1021-Remote Services directly aligns with using a backdoor for remote coordination.

**Final Answer**: D: T1021-Remote Services
