Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where system information and screenshots are collected and exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
   - The communication with the server uses HTTP on port 443.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key TTPs here are:
     - Exfiltration of data (system information and screenshots).
     - Use of a web service (Mattermost server) for communication.
     - Communication over HTTP on port 443.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
     - This technique involves using a web service to exfiltrate data.
     - It fits the scenario where data is exfiltrated to a Mattermost server, which is a web service.
   - **B: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves the use of a web service for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration.
     - It is more general and does not specifically mention exfiltration.
   - **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
     - This technique involves using one protocol to hide the use of another protocol.
     - It does not directly relate to the use of a web service for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring a malicious program is executed when a system boots or a user logs on.
     - It does not relate to the exfiltration of data over a web service.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions exfiltration of data to a web service (Mattermost server) using HTTP.
   - T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service directly addresses the use of a web service for exfiltration, which aligns with the scenario described.

**Final Answer: A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
