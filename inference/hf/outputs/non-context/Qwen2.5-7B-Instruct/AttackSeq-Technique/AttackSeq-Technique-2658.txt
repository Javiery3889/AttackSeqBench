Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Korplug variant collects system information.
   - It asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the custom loader executed the Korplug file in memory by exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. A custom loader executing the Korplug file in memory.
     2. Exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
     3. Collecting system information (uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating cloud services. It does not align with the sequence of collecting system information.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not align with the sequence of collecting system information.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the operating system, hardware, and network configuration. This aligns perfectly with the sequence of collecting system information (uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate).
   - **D: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
     - This technique involves using a network provider DLL to modify network traffic. It does not align with the sequence of collecting system information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1082-System Information Discovery.

Final Answer: C
