To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
- **Lazarus gained access to other devices within the FEIB network using hardcoded credentials.**
- **Established connections to SMB shares.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials and SMB Shares:**
   - The use of hardcoded credentials and establishing connections to SMB shares suggests that the attackers are looking to move laterally within the network and gain access to other systems.

2. **Lateral Movement:**
   - The primary goal of using hardcoded credentials and SMB shares is to move laterally within the network, which is a common tactic in lateral movement techniques.

3. **Reviewing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools or data laterally within a network. However, the scenario does not explicitly mention the transfer of tools or data.
   - **B: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking** - This technique involves hijacking a remote service session, which is not directly related to the use of hardcoded credentials and SMB shares.
   - **C: T1202-Indirect Command Execution** - This technique involves executing commands through an intermediary, which is not directly related to the use of hardcoded credentials and SMB shares.
   - **D: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication** - This technique involves authenticating to a domain controller, which is more about gaining access to the domain rather than moving laterally within the network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining access using hardcoded credentials and establishing connections to SMB shares is the act of moving laterally within the network. Among the given choices, **T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer** (A) is the most relevant as it directly pertains to moving laterally within the network.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer
