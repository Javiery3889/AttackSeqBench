To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: APT12 sent spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to gain initial access to the target systems.
2. **Persistence**: The backdoors (HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT) were then used to establish communication with their respective C2 servers to maintain Command and Control.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best as a technique that would occur before the backdoors establish communication with the C2 servers.

**A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
- SSH Hijacking involves intercepting and hijacking an SSH session. This technique is more about maintaining persistence and control over a session rather than establishing initial access or setting up C2 communication. It doesn't fit well as a technique that would occur before the backdoors establish C2 communication.

**B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
- T1071 involves the use of application layer protocols to maintain persistence. While this could be a technique used by the backdoors to communicate with the C2 server, it doesn't fit as a technique that would occur before the backdoors establish C2 communication.

**C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
- Process Hollowing involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to hide the malicious activity. This technique is more about hiding the malicious process and maintaining persistence, but it doesn't directly relate to the initial access or the establishment of C2 communication.

**D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
- T1564 involves techniques to hide artifacts on the system to maintain persistence. This could include hiding files, processes, and network connections, which are actions that would occur after initial access and before establishing C2 communication. However, it is more about maintaining stealth rather than the initial steps.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be one that directly supports the establishment of C2 communication. The technique that best fits this description is one that ensures the backdoors are not easily detected or removed by the target's security measures, which is what T1564-Hide Artifacts does.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
