Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the malware modifies the dropped DLL's file-time and deletes itself.
   - It then loads the DLL into the svchost.exe process.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing communication with the C&C servers over port 443.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:** This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain access. It does not align with the described sequence of actions.
   - **B: T1119-Automated Collection:** This technique involves the collection of data in an automated fashion. It does not fit the sequence of actions described.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or misrepresenting indicators of compromise. While it is related to the deletion of the malware itself, it does not fit the sequence of actions described.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow:** This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to run malicious code. Loading the DLL into the svchost.exe process is a form of hijacking the execution flow to run the malicious code.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves loading the DLL into the svchost.exe process, which is a form of modifying the execution flow to run the malicious code.
   - T1574-Hijack Execution Flow best fits this action as it directly involves the process of loading the malicious DLL into a legitimate process to evade detection and maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
