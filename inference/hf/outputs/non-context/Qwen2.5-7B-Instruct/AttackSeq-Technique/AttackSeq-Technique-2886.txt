To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The adversaries used `cmd.exe` with the `/C` switch for malicious script execution.
   - They then modified registry keys under `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` to persist their malicious activities.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves the use of command-line interpreters or scripting languages to execute malicious code. The use of `cmd.exe` with the `/C` switch aligns with this technique.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or control the target system. It does not align with the described TTPs.
   - **C: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user credentials or other sensitive information from web portals. It does not align with the described TTPs.
   - **D: T1648-Serverless Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code in a serverless computing environment. It does not align with the described TTPs.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with the `/C` switch is a clear indication of T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
   - The subsequent modification of the registry to persist the malicious activities is a common follow-up step after initial execution, which is consistent with T1059.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
