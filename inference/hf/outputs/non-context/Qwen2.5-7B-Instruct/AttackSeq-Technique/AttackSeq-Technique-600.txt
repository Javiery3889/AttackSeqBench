Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of proxy tools (Ngrok) for lateral movement and establishing legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - The next step in the sequence is to compile binary files from decoded snippets in the entry point and establish contact with the C2 servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1589.001 - Proxy for Lateral Movement:** This technique involves using a proxy to move laterally within a network.
   - **T1188 - Establishing a C2 Server:** This technique involves setting up a command and control server to communicate with the compromised system.
   - The next step is to compile binary files from decoded snippets and establish contact with the C2 server.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1600.001 - Reduce Key Space:** This technique is about reducing the key space to make brute-forcing more feasible. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **B: T1571 - Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection. While this could be part of the overall strategy, it does not directly address the compilation of binary files from decoded snippets.
   - **C: T1132 - Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. This aligns with the step of compiling binary files from decoded snippets, as it suggests the process of taking decoded information and forming it into executable files.
   - **D: T1556 - Modify Authentication Process:** This technique involves modifying authentication processes to gain or maintain access. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of data encoding to compile binary files from decoded snippets.
   
Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding
