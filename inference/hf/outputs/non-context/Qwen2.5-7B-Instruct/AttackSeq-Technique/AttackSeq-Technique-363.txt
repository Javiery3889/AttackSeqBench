Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that FIN8 used a script (mimi.ps1) suspected to be Mimikatz to read the memory of lsass.exe for credential dumping.
   - This is followed by system fingerprinting with commands such as `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1055.014-VDSO Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking the Virtual Dynamic Shared Object (VDSO) to perform privilege escalation. It does not align with the described credential dumping activity.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:** This technique involves the dumping of credentials from the operating system. It aligns with the use of Mimikatz to read the memory of lsass.exe for credential dumping.
   - **C: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:** This technique involves discovering network connections and is more related to network reconnaissance rather than credential dumping.
   - **D: T1555.001-Keychain:** This technique involves accessing the keychain on macOS or iOS devices, which is not relevant to the described Windows-based credential dumping activity.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the credential dumping was done using Mimikatz, which aligns with the T1003 technique.
   - The next step in the sequence is system fingerprinting, which is described by the use of `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.

Given the sequence and the alignment of the techniques, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
