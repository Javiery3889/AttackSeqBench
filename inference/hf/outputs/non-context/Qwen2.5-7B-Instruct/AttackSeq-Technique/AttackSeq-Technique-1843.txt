To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C servers, we need to understand the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack and the specific characteristics of BlackEnergy.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C servers to coordinate its malicious activities. This indicates that the initial phase of the attack involves establishing a connection with the command and control (C&C) servers.
   - We need to identify which of the given techniques would logically follow this initial communication phase.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking:** This technique involves the attacker taking control of the victim's computing resources. While this could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the communication with C&C servers.
   - **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation:** This technique involves making data difficult to understand or interpret. While data obfuscation can be a part of an attack, it is not a direct action that follows the initial communication with C&C servers.
   - **C: T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves the attacker destroying or deleting data. This could be a step that follows the initial communication, but it is more of a destructive action rather than a typical follow-up to coordination.
   - **D: T1657-Financial Theft:** This technique involves stealing financial information. Given that BlackEnergy is known for its use in financial theft, this technique is highly relevant and likely to follow the initial communication with C&C servers to coordinate the attack.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - BlackEnergy communicates with its C&C servers to coordinate its activities.
   - The next logical step would be to perform an action that directly benefits the attacker, such as stealing financial information.
   - T1657-Financial Theft aligns with the known objectives of BlackEnergy and is a direct and relevant follow-up to the initial communication phase.

**Final Answer: D: T1657-Financial Theft**
