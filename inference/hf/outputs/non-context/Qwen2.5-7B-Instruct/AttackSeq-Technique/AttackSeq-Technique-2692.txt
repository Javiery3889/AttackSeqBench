Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions a sequence of TTPs: scanning for vulnerable websites, exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.
   - The question asks which technique most likely occurred before the exploitation of CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly precede the spear-phishing step.
   - **B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via spear-phishing. This is the step that directly precedes the exploitation of CVE-2018-20250.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
     - This technique involves actions to reduce the effectiveness of security controls. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly precede the spear-phishing step.
   - **D: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
     - This technique involves using code that changes its appearance to evade detection. While it could be part of the overall attack, it doesn't directly precede the spear-phishing step.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question states that after scanning for vulnerable websites, the next step is exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.
   - The scanning for vulnerable websites is a preparatory step.
   - The spear-phishing step (sending the malicious attachment) is the immediate precursor to the exploitation of the vulnerability.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment (B) directly precedes the exploitation of CVE-2018-20250.

Final Answer: B
