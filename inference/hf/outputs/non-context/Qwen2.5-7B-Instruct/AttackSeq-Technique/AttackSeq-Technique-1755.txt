Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Shuckworm used malicious documents to execute the Pterodo backdoor.
   - It also states that the backdoor was scheduled to remain active across system reboots.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The primary TTP here is ensuring the backdoor remains active after a system reboot. This implies that the backdoor must be configured to start automatically when the system boots up.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying files or registry entries to ensure that a malicious payload is executed during system boot or logon.
     - This aligns perfectly with the requirement to ensure the backdoor remains active across system reboots.
   - **B: T1098-Account Manipulation**
     - This technique involves modifying user accounts or privileges to gain or maintain access.
     - While this could be part of an overall strategy, it does not directly address the issue of ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.
   - **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**
     - This technique involves using malicious images to deliver malware.
     - This does not address the issue of ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands.
     - While this could be used to execute the backdoor, it does not directly address the issue of ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures the backdoor remains active across system reboots is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

Final Answer: A
