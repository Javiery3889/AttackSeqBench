Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers conducted reconnaissance using fake personas on social media.
   - They then gained initial access by sending spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves reconnaissance and then gaining initial access.
   - The reconnaissance step is already covered by using fake personas on social media.
   - The next step is gaining initial access, which is achieved through spear-phishing.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using alternative methods to authenticate a user, which is not directly related to the initial access via spear-phishing.
   - **B: T1003.007-Proc Filesystem**
     - This technique involves process manipulation, which is not directly related to the initial access via spear-phishing.
   - **C: T1587.001-Malware**
     - This technique involves the use of malware, which could be a part of the spear-phishing process, but it is not the initial step.
   - **D: T1585-Establish Accounts**
     - This technique involves creating or taking over user accounts, which is a common step before sending spear-phishing emails. The attackers would need to establish accounts to send targeted messages.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The reconnaissance step is already covered by using fake personas.
   - The next step is establishing the accounts to send the spear-phishing emails, which is a logical precursor to the initial access via spear-phishing.

**Final Answer: D: T1585-Establish Accounts**
