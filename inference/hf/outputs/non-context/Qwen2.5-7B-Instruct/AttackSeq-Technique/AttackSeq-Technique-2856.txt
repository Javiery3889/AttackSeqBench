Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is:
     1. Opening a malicious shortcut file.
     2. Execution of a PowerShell command.
     3. Communication with a C&C server over HTTP.
   - We need to identify a TTP that logically occurs between the execution of the PowerShell command and the communication with the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While it could be used to encode the data sent to the C&C server, it doesn't directly relate to the execution of a PowerShell command or the communication with the C&C server.
   - **B: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**: This technique involves using SSH authorized keys for authentication. It is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell command or the communication with the C&C server over HTTP.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. It is more about evading detection rather than the sequence of actions leading to C&C communication.
   - **D: T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary channel is blocked. Given that the communication with the C&C server is over HTTP, a fallback channel might be necessary if the HTTP connection is detected or blocked.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command is a common initial step in many attack sequences.
   - After the execution of the PowerShell command, the next step is likely to be establishing a communication channel with the C&C server.
   - A fallback channel (T1008) would be a plausible technique to ensure that the communication with the C&C server can still occur even if the primary channel (HTTP) is detected or blocked.

**Final Answer: D: T1008-Fallback Channels**
