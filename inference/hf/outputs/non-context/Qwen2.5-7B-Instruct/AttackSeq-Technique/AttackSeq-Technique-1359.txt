To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described, let's break down the information provided and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **CrowdStrike's Falcon Host detected an attack involving a first stage downloader saving a file at "%Temp%/Rdws.exe"**:
   - This indicates that the initial infection vector is a downloader that drops a file in a temporary directory.

2. **That later retrieves a second stage PlugX file**:
   - This suggests that the first stage downloader is used to download and execute a second stage payload, which in this case is the PlugX malware.

3. **The adversary's method of gaining access through the compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities"**:
   - This implies that the initial compromise occurred through a website that was designed to look like a legitimate site (spoofing), and users were likely tricked into downloading the first stage downloader.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**:
   - This technique involves using a service to deliver a spearphishing attack. While it could be relevant, it doesn't directly address the drive-by compromise aspect of the attack.

B. **T1573-Encrypted Channel**:
   - This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. It does not directly address the initial compromise through a compromised website.

C. **T1648-Serverless Execution**:
   - This technique involves executing code without a traditional server. It is not directly related to the initial compromise through a website.

D. **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**:
   - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a web page that the user visits. This aligns perfectly with the scenario where a compromised website (spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities") was used to deliver the first stage downloader.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack described is the use of a drive-by compromise to deliver the initial downloader.

Final Answer: D
