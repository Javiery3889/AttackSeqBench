Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs involves achieving persistence by adding malicious files to the registry run keys.
   - Before this, the malware manipulated file ownership using `CreateProcess` and deleted initial traces such as `winword.exe`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using the `CreateProcess` API to execute a process. This aligns with the part of the sequence where the malware manipulates file ownership using `CreateProcess`.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and listing running processes. While this could be a part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly align with the manipulation of file ownership or the deletion of traces.
   - **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native Windows APIs to perform actions. This is a broader category and could include `CreateProcess`, but it does not specifically mention the manipulation of file ownership.
   - **T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions**: This technique involves excluding files or paths from certain operations, which does not directly align with the manipulation of file ownership or the deletion of traces.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1053.002-At**: This is the most specific and relevant technique for the `CreateProcess` usage mentioned in the question.
   - **T1106-Native API**: While this could be relevant, it is not as specific as `T1053.002-At`.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery**: This is not directly related to the manipulation of file ownership or the deletion of traces.
   - **T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions**: This is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is `T1053.002-At` because it directly aligns with the use of `CreateProcess` to manipulate file ownership.

Final Answer: D: T1053.002-At
