Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two main TTPs:
     1. Modification of the file-time of the dropped DLL to evade detection.
     2. Installation of a secondary payload by targeting Internet Explorer 6 with a JavaScript-based exploit.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves spreading malware through removable media. It does not directly relate to the installation of a secondary payload via a JavaScript exploit or file-time modification.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. Internet Explorer 6 is a public-facing application, and a JavaScript-based exploit is a common method to exploit such applications. This aligns well with the second TTP mentioned.
   - **C: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While it can be a part of an attack, it does not directly relate to the installation of a secondary payload via a JavaScript exploit or file-time modification.
   - **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise to evade detection. The modification of the file-time of the dropped DLL to evade detection is a specific instance of this technique. However, it does not directly address the installation of a secondary payload via a JavaScript exploit.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker first exploited a vulnerability in Internet Explorer 6 using a JavaScript-based exploit (T1190) to install a secondary payload. The modification of the file-time of the dropped DLL (T1070) is a subsequent step to evade detection.

**Final Answer: B**
