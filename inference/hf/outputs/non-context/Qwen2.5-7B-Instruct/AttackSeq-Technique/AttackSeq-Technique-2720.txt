To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents to gain initial access.
   - Before this, the group is said to have used a technique to prepare and target specific individuals within the defense industry.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files** - This technique involves searching for credentials in files, which is not directly related to preparing and targeting specific individuals.
   - **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** - This technique involves collecting information about the target, which is highly relevant to preparing and targeting specific individuals.
   - **C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks** - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets, which is more about reconnaissance rather than preparing and targeting specific individuals.
   - **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools** - This technique involves using software to deploy malware or other tools, which is more about the post-exploitation phase rather than the preparation phase.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question emphasizes the need to prepare and target specific individuals, which aligns closely with the need to gather detailed information about these individuals.
   - T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information (B) directly addresses the need to collect information about the target individuals, making it the most relevant technique in this context.

**Final Answer: B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
