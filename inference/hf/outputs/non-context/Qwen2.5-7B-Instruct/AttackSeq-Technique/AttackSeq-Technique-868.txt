To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Spearphishing and Compromise of Servers**: The question mentions that GreyEnergy's operators used spearphishing and the compromise of servers as infection vectors. This means the initial compromise of the network likely involved these techniques.

2. **Lateral Movement**: After the initial compromise, the attackers attempted to move laterally within the network to other workstations.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best as a technique that would occur before lateral movement:

A. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications. While it could be a method to gain initial access, it is not directly related to the initial compromise via spearphishing and server compromise.

B. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts on the system to avoid detection. It is more relevant to maintaining access and avoiding detection rather than the initial compromise.

C. **T1217-Browser Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about browsers and browser plugins. It is more relevant to gathering information rather than the initial compromise or lateral movement.

D. **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party system or product to gain access to the target network. Given that the initial compromise involved the compromise of servers, this technique aligns well with the idea of using a compromised server as an infection vector.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that the attackers used the compromise of servers as an initial vector, and then they likely used a technique that would help them maintain access and move laterally. Among the choices, T1195-Supply Chain Compromise (D) is the most relevant to the initial compromise and the subsequent lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D**
