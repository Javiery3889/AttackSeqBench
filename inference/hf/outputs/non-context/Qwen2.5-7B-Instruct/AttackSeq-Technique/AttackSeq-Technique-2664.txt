Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives. This is a data collection activity.
   - The next step is establishing encrypted communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol. This indicates a method of communication that is not standard and likely involves encryption.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1608-Stage Capabilities** - This technique involves the attacker using a legitimate application to stage capabilities. It does not directly relate to establishing encrypted communication.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port** - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection. While it is related to communication, it does not specifically mention encryption or a custom protocol.
   - **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. It does not align with the communication aspect of the question.
   - **D: T1090.002-External Proxy** - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. While it can be used for communication, it does not specifically address the use of a custom TCP-based protocol or encryption.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question specifically mentions a custom TCP-based protocol and encrypted communication. The closest match to this description is the use of a non-standard port for communication, which can be used to establish encrypted and custom communication channels.

**Final Answer: B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
