Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Charming Kitten used decoy websites impersonating entities like Instagram and Google services for phishing.
   - After the phishing, they controlled the phishing websites using unique servers to collect stolen data.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
     - This technique involves the use of chat messages to communicate with victims or to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the sequence of using decoy websites for phishing and then controlling the websites to collect data.
   - **B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves acquiring or establishing infrastructure to support the adversary's operations. This aligns well with the step of controlling the phishing websites using unique servers to collect stolen data.
   - **C: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**
     - This technique involves adding a loadable code library to a process to extend its functionality. It is not directly related to the sequence of phishing and controlling the websites.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or clipboard contents. While it can be used to collect data, it does not align with the step of controlling the phishing websites.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack described is the step of acquiring infrastructure to control the phishing websites and collect stolen data.

**Final Answer: B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
