Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini.
   - Leveraging Nmap and Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator privileges.
   - Performing lateral movement using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves the attacker using valid user accounts to gain access to systems. While this is part of the overall attack, it does not specifically describe the lateral movement aspect.
   - **B: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves the attacker using remote services to establish a foothold on a system. Tools like PsExec and WinExe are often used to execute commands on remote systems, which aligns with this technique.
   - **C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
     - This technique involves the attacker using spearphishing to exploit internal users. This does not align with the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
   - **D: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
     - This technique involves the attacker using WMI event subscriptions to execute code. While this can be a method of lateral movement, it is not as directly related to the use of PsExec and WinExe as T1021.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions the use of tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement. These tools are primarily used to execute commands on remote systems, which is a core function of the T1021 technique.
   - T1078 is more about using valid accounts, which is a step that has already been completed (obtaining domain administrator privileges).
   - T1534 is about spearphishing, which is not relevant to the use of these specific tools.
   - T1546.003 involves WMI, which is a different method of lateral movement and not as directly related to the use of PsExec and WinExe.

**Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services**
