Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group, APT-TOCS, downloads a Shellcode script via PowerShell and maintains multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
   - The final step in the sequence is establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1566.002 - Multi-Beacon Communication:** This technique involves maintaining persistent communication with the attacker to evade detection.
   - **T1573.001 - Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves using symmetric encryption to secure communications.
   - **T1573.002 - Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels to secure communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1654-Log Enumeration:** This technique involves enumerating logs to identify and exfiltrate sensitive information. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands. While PowerShell is mentioned, this does not directly relate to establishing secure communication.
   - **C: T1573.001 - Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique is about using symmetric encryption, which is a method to secure communications but not specifically about the use of HTTP GET requests.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using encrypted channels, which aligns with the use of HTTP GET requests to specific URLs for secure communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described attack sequence is the use of an encrypted channel to secure communication via HTTP GET requests.
   
Final Answer: D
