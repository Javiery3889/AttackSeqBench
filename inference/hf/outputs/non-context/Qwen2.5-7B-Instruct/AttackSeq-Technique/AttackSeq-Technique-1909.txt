Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT10 uses spear phishing campaigns with malicious attachments or links to compromise targets before deploying malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT. We need to identify which ATT&CK technique was most likely used for this initial compromise.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**: This technique involves stealing session cookies from a web application. It is not directly related to spear phishing with malicious attachments or links.
- **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique is about exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not the default or expected one. It does not fit the context of the initial compromise via spear phishing.
- **C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. It is a broad category that includes spear phishing.
- **D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**: This is a more specific sub-technique of T1566 that involves using a legitimate service to deliver spear phishing emails. It is closely related to the context of the question.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that APT10 uses spear phishing campaigns with malicious attachments or links to compromise targets. This aligns with the broader category of T1566-Phishing.
- However, T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service is a more specific and relevant sub-technique that involves using a legitimate service to deliver spear phishing emails, which is a common method used by APTs to avoid detection.
- T1539 and T1048 do not fit the context of the initial compromise via spear phishing.

Final Answer: D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service
