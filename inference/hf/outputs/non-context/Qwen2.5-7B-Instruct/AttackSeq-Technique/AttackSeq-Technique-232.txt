To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a multi-step process where a threat actor group uses batch files to decode and deploy additional malicious payloads.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to facilitate the delivery of the malicious documents to victim organizations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1137.006-Add-ins:** This technique involves the use of add-ins or extensions to deliver malicious content. However, it does not directly address the delivery of documents to victim organizations.
   - **B: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain:** This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain to deliver malicious content. While it is a sophisticated method, it is not typically the initial step in delivering documents to victim organizations.
   - **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves using legitimate system or application features to gain elevated privileges. It does not directly address the delivery of documents to victim organizations.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. It is a common method for delivering malicious documents to victim organizations.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the initial step of delivering malicious documents to victim organizations.
   - Phishing (T1566) is a widely used method to trick users into opening malicious documents, which can then be decoded and deployed using batch files.
   - The other techniques (T1137.006, T1195.003, and T1548) are more about gaining access or privileges after the initial document delivery, not the initial delivery itself.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for facilitating the delivery of malicious documents to victim organizations is T1566-Phishing.

Final Answer: D
