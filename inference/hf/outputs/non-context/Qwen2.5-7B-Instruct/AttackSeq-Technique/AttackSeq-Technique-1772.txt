Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware (Sayad) steals credentials for various tools and then collects sensitive data.
   - The question asks about the technique that occurs to gather environment-related data such as browser information, which comes after credential theft and before collecting sensitive data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities** - This technique involves developing or enhancing capabilities to support the adversary's objectives. It does not specifically relate to gathering environment-related data.
   - **B: T1547.012-Print Processors** - This technique involves using print processors to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the context of gathering browser information.
   - **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** - This technique involves identifying the system owner or user to gain additional information or privileges. It is more about discovering who is using the system rather than gathering browser information.
   - **D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the browser being used, which directly aligns with the question's requirement to gather environment-related data such as browser information.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the malware is gathering environment-related data, and the most relevant technique for this is T1217-Browser Information Discovery, as it directly pertains to collecting information about the browser.
   - The other techniques do not fit the context of the question as well as T1217 does.

**Final Answer: D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**
