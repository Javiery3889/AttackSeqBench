Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Bandook campaign uses URL shortening services to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker.
   - After the redirection, PowerShell scripts are executed to drop additional files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using URL shortening services.
     2. Redirecting to a domain controlled by the attacker.
     3. Executing PowerShell scripts.
     4. Dropping additional files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious content into a legitimate web page or application. It does not directly relate to the use of URL shortening or executing PowerShell scripts.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves establishing a secure, encrypted communication channel to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the initial redirection or execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services, such as domain generation algorithms (DGAs), command and control (C2) servers, or other remote services to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data. URL shortening services can be considered a form of external remote service.
   - **D: T1584.005-Botnet**
     - This technique involves using a botnet to distribute malware or perform other malicious activities. While it could be relevant in a broader context, it does not directly describe the sequence of actions involving URL shortening and PowerShell script execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of URL shortening services to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker is a form of external remote service.
   - Executing PowerShell scripts to drop additional files is a direct action that follows the redirection.
   - T1133-External Remote Services (C) best describes the use of URL shortening services, which is the first step in the sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
