To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Hidden Cobra gained initial access to the Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document, let's analyze the sequence of TTPs involved in this scenario.

1. **Initial Access (T1566-Phishing)**: This is the technique that describes the use of spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document to gain initial access to the target organization. This is the final step in the sequence as described in the question.

2. **Identifying the Preceding TTP**: We need to identify which TTP would logically occur before the phishing attack. The phishing attack itself is the method used to gain initial access, so we need to look at the preparatory steps that would enable the use of phishing.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing the tools and resources to conduct an attack. While this is a crucial step, it is not directly related to the specific method of gaining initial access through phishing.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves the use of external remote services to support the attack. This is more about maintaining access rather than gaining initial access.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the target's systems and networks. This is a preparatory step that would enable the attacker to craft a more effective phishing campaign.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**: This is the technique used to gain initial access, as mentioned in the question. It is the final step, not the preceding one.

4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible TTP that would occur before the phishing attack is the gathering of information about the target's systems and networks, which would enable the attacker to craft a more effective phishing campaign.

Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery
