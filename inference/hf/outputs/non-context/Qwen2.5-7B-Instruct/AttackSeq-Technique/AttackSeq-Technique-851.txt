To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for keeping control of the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **T1218.015-Electron Applications**: This technique involves the use of Electron applications to maintain persistence. While it can be used to establish a foothold, it does not specifically address the need for multiple communication stages to maintain control.

2. **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: This technique involves the use of multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. It is designed to ensure that even if one communication channel is blocked, others remain available, thus facilitating long-term control over the compromised infrastructure.

3. **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel, which allows for both command and control (C2) and data exfiltration. However, it does not necessarily imply multiple stages of communication.

4. **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: This technique involves using remote services to gain access to a system. While it can be part of the initial compromise, it does not directly address the need for maintaining control through multiple communication stages.

Given the need to maintain control through multiple communication stages, the most appropriate technique is **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**. This technique is specifically designed to ensure that the attacker can maintain control over the compromised infrastructure by using multiple communication channels, which can be used in sequence or concurrently to evade detection and maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
