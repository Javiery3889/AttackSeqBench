Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Establishing persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry.
     2. Communicating with C&C servers via dynamic DNS providers.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur for gathering specific system details from the infected machine before the communication with C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure** - This technique is about hiding the infrastructure used by the attacker, which is not directly related to gathering system details.
   - **B: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery** - This technique involves discovering trust relationships between domains, which is not relevant to the context of gathering system details.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique is about ensuring the malware runs at boot or logon, which is related to persistence but not to gathering system details.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, network configuration, and other details, which is directly relevant to the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the malware is gathering specific system details before communicating with C&C servers. Among the given options, T1082-System Information Discovery is the only technique that directly involves gathering system information.
   - The other techniques (T1665, T1482, and T1547) are not directly related to the task of gathering system details.

**Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
