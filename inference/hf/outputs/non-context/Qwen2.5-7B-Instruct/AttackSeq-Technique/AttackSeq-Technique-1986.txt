Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The initial TTP is DLL Hijacking, which is a technique where an attacker tricks a system into loading a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one.
   - After this, the adversary maintains persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves maintaining persistence after the initial execution of the malware via DLL Hijacking.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance** - This technique involves reverting a cloud instance to a previous state, which is not related to maintaining persistence on a local system.
   - **B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** - This technique involves removing obfuscation or decoding from files or information, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence.
   - **C: T1542.005-TFTP Boot** - This technique involves booting a system using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), which is not relevant to maintaining persistence on a local system.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when a system boots or when a user logs on. This aligns with the scenario of maintaining persistence by planting a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

4. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes maintaining persistence after the initial execution of malware via DLL Hijacking.
   - The most relevant technique for maintaining persistence is ensuring that malware is executed at boot or logon, which is covered by T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: D**
