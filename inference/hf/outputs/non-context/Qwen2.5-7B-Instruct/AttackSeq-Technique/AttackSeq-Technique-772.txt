Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with Patchwork using CVE-2017-8750 through malicious RTF documents to gain Initial Access.
   - The next phase in the attack sequence is Reconnaissance, where the attackers would identify targeted recipients who interacted with their spear phishing emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT** - This technique involves the use of AutoHotKey and AutoIT scripts to automate tasks. It is not directly related to identifying targeted recipients through spear phishing.
   - **B: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases** - This technique involves searching open technical databases for information that can be used to craft more targeted attacks. While it can be part of reconnaissance, it is not directly related to identifying recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.
   - **C: T1598-Phishing for Information** - This technique involves using phishing to gather information. It aligns with the need to identify targeted recipients who would be likely to interact with the spear phishing emails.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution** - This technique involves the execution of code or applications by a user. While it is part of the attack chain, it is not specifically about identifying targeted recipients.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the Reconnaissance phase, specifically identifying targeted recipients.
   - T1598-Phishing for Information directly involves using phishing to gather information, which aligns with the need to identify recipients who would be likely to interact with the spear phishing emails.

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
