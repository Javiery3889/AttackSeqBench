To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Executing PowerShell scripts via malicious Office documents**: This indicates the use of a technique that involves delivering and executing malicious code through a document, which aligns with T1204.001 - Macro Execution (not directly listed, but related to T1204).

2. **Downloading poisoned installers**: This suggests the use of a technique to download and install malware, which could be related to T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter (for downloading and executing the installer).

3. **Obfuscation to improve server persistence and hide malicious JavaScript on compromised websites**: This indicates the use of techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection, which could be related to T1543 - Persistence and T1132 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (for hiding the JavaScript).

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves obfuscating files to evade detection. While it fits part of the sequence, it does not directly address the initial steps of downloading poisoned installers.

B. **T1037.002-Login Hook**: This technique involves using a login hook to execute code when a user logs in. It does not directly relate to the initial steps of downloading poisoned installers.

C. **T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a process. It does not directly relate to the initial steps of downloading poisoned installers.

D. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. It aligns well with the initial steps of downloading poisoned installers, as it involves executing scripts or commands to download and install malware.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would start with T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter, followed by obfuscation techniques to maintain persistence and hide malicious JavaScript.

**Final Answer: D**
