To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Context and Sequence**:
   - The question mentions that StellarParticle used AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets to gather information from Active Directory.
   - After gathering information from Active Directory, they accessed data from Information Repositories for collection.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves discovering the system time of a target system. It is not directly related to gathering information from Active Directory or accessing data from Information Repositories.
   - **B: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to perform actions on the target system. It does not directly relate to the gathering of information from Active Directory.
   - **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**: This technique involves poisoning the ARP cache to redirect traffic to a malicious host. It is not directly related to the gathering of information from Active Directory or accessing data from Information Repositories.
   - **D: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**: This technique involves using unsecured credentials to access systems or data. After gathering information from Active Directory, it is plausible that StellarParticle might use unsecured credentials to access data from Information Repositories, as they would have the necessary information to identify and use these credentials.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets are used to gather information from Active Directory.
   - The next step in the sequence would likely involve using the gathered information to access data from Information Repositories.
   - Among the given options, T1552-Unsecured Credentials (D) is the most plausible technique that would follow the gathering of information from Active Directory and lead to accessing data from Information Repositories.

**Final Answer: D**
