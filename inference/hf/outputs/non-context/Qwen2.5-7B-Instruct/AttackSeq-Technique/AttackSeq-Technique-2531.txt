To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the LURK malware connected to a command-and-control server and used a backup domain for communication after gaining initial access via socially engineered emails, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1561-Disk Wipe (A)**: This technique involves wiping data from a disk. It is not typically a precursor to gaining initial access or using a backup domain for communication. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

2. **T1659-Content Injection (B)**: This technique involves injecting content into a system, such as web pages or documents. While it can be a method of delivering malware, it is not directly related to gaining initial access via socially engineered emails or using a backup domain for communication.

3. **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (C)**: This technique involves ensuring that malware is executed when a system boots or a user logs on. While this can be a step in the malware lifecycle, it is not the initial access method described in the question, which is via socially engineered emails.

4. **T1566-Phishing (D)**: This technique involves using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. This aligns perfectly with the initial access method described in the question, which is gaining access via socially engineered emails.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access was gained through phishing (T1566), which then led to the malware connecting to a command-and-control server and using a backup domain for communication.

Final Answer: D
