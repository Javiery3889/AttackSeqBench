Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Mustang Panda deployed malicious payloads in the background during the execution phase.
   - It also specifies that the initial access was enabled using embedded '.lnk' files.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial access technique used '.lnk' files, which are typically used for social engineering or to trick users into executing malicious code.
   - The malicious payloads were deployed in the background, indicating a persistence mechanism.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using malicious content to entice users to provide sensitive information or execute malicious code. While '.lnk' files can be used in phishing attacks, the question specifically mentions '.lnk' files, which are more commonly associated with social engineering rather than phishing.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading** - This technique involves making the malware or attacker appear to be something else, such as a legitimate user or system. This does not directly relate to the use of '.lnk' files for initial access.
   - **C: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations** - This technique involves changing the configuration of cloud-based services to gain unauthorized access. It does not align with the use of '.lnk' files for initial access.
   - **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts** - This technique involves using default or weak credentials to gain access to a system. It does not align with the use of '.lnk' files for initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the use of '.lnk' files for initial access, is best described by T1566-Phishing, as it involves using malicious content to entice users, which aligns with the use of '.lnk' files.

Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing
