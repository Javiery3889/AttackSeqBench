Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves Longhorn establishing persistence via a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
   - The persistence technique used a zero-day exploit, which is a previously unknown vulnerability.
   - The attack also involved avoiding detection using in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is the use of a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
   - The next step is establishing persistence.
   - The final step is avoiding detection using in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing or obfuscating indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While it fits the final step of avoiding detection, it does not directly relate to the initial steps of the attack sequence.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious files. While a Word document could be used in a phishing attack, the question specifically mentions a zero-day exploit, which is more aligned with a targeted attack rather than a broad phishing campaign.
   - **C: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type:** This technique involves disguising a file as a different type to evade detection. This could be relevant to the initial step of embedding a zero-day exploit in a Word document to trick the user into opening it.
   - **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts:** This technique involves using cloud storage to exfiltrate data or host malicious content. It does not align with the initial steps of the attack sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is that the initial step involves embedding a zero-day exploit in a Word document, which aligns with the technique of masquerading the file type to trick the user.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is C: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type.

Final Answer: C
