Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Yellow Garuda used macro-enabled template files hosted on third-party services to gain initial access.
   - It also asks about preparatory actions to craft tools like the Telegram 'grabber' or other malicious software for their campaigns.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1588.004-Digital Certificates** - This technique involves the use of digital certificates to establish trust and legitimacy. It does not directly relate to the preparatory actions of crafting tools.
   - **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities** - This technique involves the development of tools, techniques, and procedures to support the threat actor's objectives. This aligns well with the preparatory actions of crafting tools like the Telegram 'grabber'.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves making files or information difficult to understand or use. While it can be a part of the overall campaign, it does not specifically address the preparatory actions of developing tools.
   - **D: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server** - This technique involves the use of a virtual private server to host malicious content or services. It is more about the infrastructure used rather than the development of tools.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is specifically asking about the preparatory actions to develop tools like the Telegram 'grabber'.
   - T1587-Develop Capabilities (B) directly addresses the development of tools and techniques, which is the core of the preparatory actions mentioned in the question.
   - The other techniques (A, C, and D) do not align as closely with the development of tools.

**Final Answer: B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
