Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Machete staging data by encrypting files and logs in a temporary folder.
     - Using the same channel for both Command and Control (C&C) and data exfiltration every 10 minutes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a non-C2 channel using asymmetric encryption. However, the question specifies that the same channel is used for both C&C and data exfiltration, which does not align with this technique.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves using native system APIs to perform actions. While this could be part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly address the use of a channel for both C&C and data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves gathering data from the local system. While this could be part of the initial data staging, it does not directly address the use of a channel for both C&C and data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
     - This technique involves scheduling the transfer of data at a specific time. Given that the question mentions data exfiltration every 10 minutes, this technique aligns well with the requirement of a scheduled transfer.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies a regular, scheduled transfer of data every 10 minutes, which is a key characteristic of T1029-Scheduled Transfer.
   - T1048.002, T1106, and T1005 do not directly address the scheduling aspect of the data transfer.

**Final Answer: D: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
