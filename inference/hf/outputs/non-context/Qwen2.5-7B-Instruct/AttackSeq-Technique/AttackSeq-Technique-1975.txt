Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that attackers gained Initial Access via phishing emails and that this was preceded by a Reconnaissance phase.
   - During the Reconnaissance phase, the attackers targeted specific details about potential victims.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1137.001-Office Template Macros:** This technique involves using macros in Office templates to execute malicious code. While it can be part of a phishing campaign, it does not directly target specific details about potential victims.
   - **B: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning:** This technique involves scanning for specific words or phrases in files, which is more about searching for content rather than gathering specific details about victims.
   - **C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information:** This technique directly involves collecting information about specific individuals or organizations, which aligns with the question's description of targeting specific details about potential victims.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control channel, which is typically done after gaining access, not during the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the attackers targeted specific details about potential victims during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - Among the given options, T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information (C) is the most relevant as it directly involves collecting information about specific individuals or organizations, which aligns with the question's description.
   - The other options either do not fit the context of the Reconnaissance phase or are actions taken after gaining access.

**Final Answer: C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
