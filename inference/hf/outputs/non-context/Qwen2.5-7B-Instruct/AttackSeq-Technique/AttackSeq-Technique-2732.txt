Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The Lazarus group has already executed credential harvesting using Responder, which means they have obtained login credentials.
   - They are planning to use these credentials for lateral movement.
   - Before lateral movement, they are likely to discover network shares and system network connections.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Credential harvesting (using Responder) → Lateral movement → Network share and system network connections discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. It is not directly related to the discovery of network shares or system network connections.
   - **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about network connections, which aligns with the next step in the sequence after gaining credentials and before lateral movement.
   - **C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one used for normal communication. It is not relevant to the immediate next step of discovering network shares and system network connections.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system owner or user, which could be useful for lateral movement but is not the immediate next step after gaining credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Lazarus group has already harvested credentials.
   - The next logical step is to use these credentials to discover what network resources are available.
   - System network connections discovery (T1049) is the most relevant technique for this step.

**Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
