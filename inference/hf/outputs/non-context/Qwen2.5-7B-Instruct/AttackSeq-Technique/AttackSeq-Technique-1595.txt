To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before T9000 compressed, encrypted, and sent collected sensitive data to its C2 server during exfiltration, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the described sequence of TTPs.

1. **T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**: This technique involves exfiltrating data to a text-based storage site, such as a web page or a file-sharing service. This does not align with the described sequence, as the question specifies that the data is compressed, encrypted, and sent to a C2 server, not stored in a text-based format.

2. **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves using a C2 channel for exfiltration. While this is related to exfiltration over a C2 channel, it does not specifically address the compression and encryption steps mentioned in the question.

3. **T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools**: This technique involves disabling or modifying tools that could be used to detect or respond to the attacker's actions. This is a defensive measure and does not align with the exfiltration process described.

4. **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which is a prerequisite for the encryption and exfiltration of data. The question mentions that the data is compressed, encrypted, and sent to a C2 server, indicating that an encrypted channel is necessary for the exfiltration process.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence would start with establishing an encrypted channel, followed by the compression and encryption of the data, and then the exfiltration over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
