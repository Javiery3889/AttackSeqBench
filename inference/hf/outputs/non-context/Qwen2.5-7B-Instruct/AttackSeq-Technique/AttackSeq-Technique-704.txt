Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Cobalt Strike Beacon is deployed using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
   - TA505 then maintains access by hijacking `RegIdleBackup` and altering its associated COM handler.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** Cobalt Strike Beacon deployment using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
   - **Subsequent TTP:** Maintaining access by hijacking `RegIdleBackup` and altering its associated COM handler.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1059.009-Cloud API**
     - This technique involves using cloud APIs to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It does not align with the described TTPs.
   - **B: T1505.004-IIS Components**
     - This technique involves using IIS components to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the described TTPs.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to maintain persistence. While `RegIdleBackup` is a scheduled task, the specific technique of altering the COM handler is not directly covered by this technique.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to maintain persistence. It does not align with the described TTPs.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions hijacking `RegIdleBackup` and altering its associated COM handler. This is a technique that involves modifying a scheduled task to maintain persistence.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this specific action is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job, as it covers the creation or modification of scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
