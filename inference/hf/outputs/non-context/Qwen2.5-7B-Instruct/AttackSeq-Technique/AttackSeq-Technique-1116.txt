To determine the most plausible ATT&CK technique for the communication with newly registered domains, let's analyze the given sequence of TTPs and the options provided.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions the use of spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments, which aligns with T1563.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
2. **Execution**: The deployment of DanBot for execution is mentioned, which could be related to T1059.003 (Windows PowerShell) or other execution techniques depending on the specifics of DanBot.

The next step in the sequence involves communication with newly registered domains. This communication is likely to be bidirectional, meaning the attacker's infrastructure is communicating with the compromised system to maintain control and gather data.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names at runtime, which is more about the resolution process rather than the communication itself.

B. **T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**: This technique involves using vulnerabilities to gain access to credentials, which is not directly related to the communication with newly registered domains.

C. **T1003.001-LSASS Memory**: This technique involves accessing the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory to extract credentials, which is also not related to the communication with newly registered domains.

D. **T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**: This technique involves maintaining bidirectional communication with a remote server, which aligns well with the scenario of communicating with newly registered domains to maintain control and gather data.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible ATT&CK technique for the communication with newly registered domains is T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication.

Final Answer: D
