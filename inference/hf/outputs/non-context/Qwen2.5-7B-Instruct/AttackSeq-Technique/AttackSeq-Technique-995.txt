To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The question mentions FIN7, which is known for using sophisticated cyber-attack techniques.
   - The attack sequence involves deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery, followed by data exfiltration using the SmartFTP Client.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1497.001-System Checks**
     - This technique involves checking the system to ensure it is in a state that allows for the execution of the attack. While it is a plausible step, it is more of a preparatory action rather than a direct follow-up to network reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating systems on a network. It directly follows network reconnaissance and data discovery, as it would be the next step in understanding the target environment.
   - **C: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
     - This technique involves intercepting and controlling SSH sessions. While it can be a part of an attack, it is not directly related to the immediate follow-up of network reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While it can be used for data exfiltration, it is not the immediate follow-up to network reconnaissance and data discovery.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Cobalt Strike is used for network reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - The next logical step would be to identify and enumerate systems on the network to understand the target environment better.
   - T1018-Remote System Discovery (Remote System Discovery) fits this description as it directly follows the reconnaissance phase and helps in identifying and enumerating systems.

**Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
