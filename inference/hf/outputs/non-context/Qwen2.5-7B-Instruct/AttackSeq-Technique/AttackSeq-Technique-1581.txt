Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves the use of Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control (C2) server accessed via SMB to execute additional PowerShell scripts.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to transfer exfiltrated data out of the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts** - This technique involves the use of cloud storage services for credential access. While OneDrive is a cloud storage service, the question does not mention the use of credentials to access OneDrive, so this is less likely.
   - **B: T1029-Scheduled Transfer** - This technique involves the use of scheduled tasks to transfer data. There is no indication in the question that the data transfer was scheduled, so this is less likely.
   - **C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage** - This technique involves the use of cloud storage services to exfiltrate data. Since the question mentions OneDrive as a cloud storage service used for C2 and data execution, this technique aligns well with the scenario.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** - This technique involves using a C2 channel for data exfiltration. The question already mentions the use of OneDrive as a C2 server, but it does not specify that the data was exfiltrated over this channel. The question is more focused on the storage aspect of OneDrive rather than the exfiltration method.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes the use of OneDrive as a C2 server and the execution of PowerShell scripts. The focus is on the storage and potential exfiltration of data from the network.
   - Among the given options, T1530-Data from Cloud Storage (C) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the use of cloud storage (OneDrive) for data exfiltration, which is the final step in the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C**
