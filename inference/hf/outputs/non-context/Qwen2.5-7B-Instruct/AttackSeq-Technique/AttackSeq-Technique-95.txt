Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is used to check for installed antivirus software.
   - PowerShell execution is avoided during defense evasion.
   - Information about detected antivirus software is sent to a C2 server using webserv-redir.net.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the C2 communication. While it could be part of a broader strategy, it doesn't directly describe the method of sending information to the C2 server.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery** - This technique involves gathering information about the target system, which aligns with checking for installed antivirus software. However, it does not describe the method of sending this information to the C2 server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. Webserv-redir.net is a method of using web servers to redirect traffic, which is an application layer protocol. This aligns well with the described action of sending information to the C2 server.
   - **D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity** - This technique involves using multiple identities to evade detection. It does not align with the described action of sending information to the C2 server.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly addresses the method of sending information to the C2 server using webserv-redir.net.

Final Answer: C
