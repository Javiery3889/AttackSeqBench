Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Exploitation of CVE-2015-5119**: This is the initial vector used to gain entry into the system.
2. **Execution of "%Temp%/Rdws.exe"**: This is the first-stage payload that is dropped and executed.
3. **Retrieval of a second-stage PlugX file**: This indicates that the first-stage payload is used to download and execute a second-stage payload.
4. **Communication with C2 domains such as inocnation[.]com**: This is the final step where the malware communicates with its command and control server.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1001.002-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data. It is not typically used for communication with C2 servers but rather for data exfiltration or hiding malicious content.

B. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with C2 servers. This is a common method for malware to establish a covert channel for communication.

C. **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: This technique involves infecting a user's system through a malicious website or drive-by download. While this can be part of the initial infection vector, it does not directly address the communication with C2 servers.

D. **T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves the use of data from the local system, which is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for facilitating communication with C2 domains is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly addresses the method of communication used by malware to interact with its command and control server.

**Final Answer: B**
