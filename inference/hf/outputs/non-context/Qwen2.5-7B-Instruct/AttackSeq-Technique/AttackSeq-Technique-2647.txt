Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     - Establishing command and control using FTP and HTTP.
     - Encrypting data with AES for transmission.
     - Machete exfiltrating data by copying it to removable drives when a specific file was present.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an encrypted channel that is not used for command and control. While it involves encryption, it does not specifically mention copying data to removable drives.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots, which is not directly related to the described TTPs of command and control, data encryption, and exfiltration.
   - **C: T1056.001-Keylogging**
     - This technique involves capturing keystrokes, which could be used to gather sensitive information. However, it does not directly relate to the exfiltration method described (copying to removable drives).
   - **D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data by physically moving it from one location to another, such as copying files to a USB drive. This aligns with the described method of exfiltrating data by copying it to removable drives.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the described exfiltration method, is best represented by T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium.

Final Answer: D
