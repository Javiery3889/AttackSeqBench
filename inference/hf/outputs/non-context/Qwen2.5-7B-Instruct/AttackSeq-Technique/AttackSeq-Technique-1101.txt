To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack exploited unpatched vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the victim's network. This indicates that the initial compromise was likely through a vulnerability in a publicly-facing application or service.

2. **Persistence**: After gaining initial access, the Winnti implant registered itself as a service to ensure persistence across reboots. This is a common technique to maintain long-term access to the system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to gain access. However, the question specifies that the initial access was through exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, which is more aligned with exploiting a publicly-facing application or service rather than local accounts.

- **B: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While this can be a method of maintaining access, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to maintain access. While this could be a method of maintaining access, it does not directly address the initial exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.

- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a publicly-facing application to gain initial access. This aligns perfectly with the question's description of exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities to gain initial access.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial access was through exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in a publicly-facing application, which aligns with the T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application technique.

**Final Answer: D**
