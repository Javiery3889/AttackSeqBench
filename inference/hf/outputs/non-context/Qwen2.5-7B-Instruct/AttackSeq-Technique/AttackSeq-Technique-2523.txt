Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BlueDelta first exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube to perform discovery activities.
   - After the discovery activities, they implemented filters in the managesieve plugin for automatic forwarding to collect emails.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the victim, which aligns with the "discovery activities" mentioned in the question.
   - **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves altering the normal execution flow of a process, which is not directly related to the discovery activities or the implementation of filters for email forwarding.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate or manipulate data. While it could be related to the email forwarding, it does not directly describe the discovery activities.
   - **D: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS**
     - This technique involves collecting DNS query and response data, which is more related to network reconnaissance and not directly to the discovery activities or email forwarding.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the first step was "discovery activities gathering system and network data." The most appropriate technique that aligns with this description is T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information, as it involves collecting information about the victim, which is a form of discovery.
   - The next step mentioned is the implementation of filters in the managesieve plugin for automatic forwarding, which is a separate action and not a TTP that would occur immediately after the discovery activities.

**Final Answer: A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
