Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - ZeroT retrieves stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs using steganography.
   - ZeroT transmits system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key TTP here is the use of RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons for transmitting system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols to exfiltrate data. It does not match the use of HTTP POST beacons.
   - **B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
     - This technique involves using multiple identity sources to evade detection. It does not match the use of HTTP POST beacons for data exfiltration.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons fall under this category as they use encryption to transmit data.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not match the use of HTTP POST beacons for data exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1573-Encrypted Channel.

Final Answer: C
