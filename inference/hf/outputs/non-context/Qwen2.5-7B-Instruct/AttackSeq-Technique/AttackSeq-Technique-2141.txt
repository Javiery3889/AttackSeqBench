Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The malware made a POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.
   - The goal is to transfer additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step involves communication with a C2 domain (judystevenson[.]info).
   - The next step is to transfer additional tools or payloads to other C2 domains.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols to exfiltrate data or transfer files. It does not directly relate to the transfer of tools or payloads to C2 domains.
   - **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
     - This technique involves using domain controller authentication to gain access to network resources. It is not directly related to the transfer of tools or payloads to C2 domains.
   - **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or payloads to a target network. It aligns well with the scenario where additional tools or payloads are transferred to communicate with multiple C2 domains.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing sensitive information. It does not directly relate to the transfer of tools or payloads to C2 domains.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the described attack sequence is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.

Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
