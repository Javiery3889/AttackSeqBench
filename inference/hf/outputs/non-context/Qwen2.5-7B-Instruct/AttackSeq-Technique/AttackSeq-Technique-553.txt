Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used in Operation Pawn Storm.
   - It mentions multistage downloaders establishing execution and phishing websites for credential harvesting.
   - The specific technique we are looking for is one that captures credentials by logging victim input on fake OWA (Outlook Web Access) log-in pages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data. It does not specifically address credential harvesting through input logging.
   - **B: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with the scenario of logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages. It is a direct match for the described credential harvesting method.
   - **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography:** This technique involves the use of symmetric encryption to protect data. It does not pertain to the method of capturing credentials through input logging.
   - **D: T1110.003-Password Spraying:** This technique involves attempting to log in to a system using a list of common passwords. While it can be used to harvest credentials, it does not specifically describe the method of logging input on a fake log-in page.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the technique involves logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages, which is a form of input capture.
   - T1056-Input Capture (B) is the technique that directly addresses the method of capturing user input, which is exactly what the question is asking for.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
