Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the initial access was through a supply chain attack exploiting the update mechanism of NoxPlayer. This aligns with the T1195-Supply Chain Compromise technique.

2. **Malware Execution Flow Alteration**: The question states that the malware execution flow was altered to hide the dialog and avoid displaying on the Windows Taskbar to simulate user interaction. This action is aimed at evading detection and maintaining persistence, which is a common tactic in post-exploitation activities.

3. **Evasion Techniques**: The techniques that can be used to hide processes and evade detection include:
   - **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to hide the malicious code or processes.
   - **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native Windows APIs to perform actions that are less likely to be detected by security software.

4. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1547.010-Port Monitors**: This technique involves monitoring network ports to detect and respond to network-based threats. It does not align with the described evasion technique.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique is about the initial access, not the post-exploitation activities described in the question.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: While this technique can be used to hide processes, it is not the most direct or common method for hiding a dialog and avoiding the Taskbar.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**: This technique is directly related to using native Windows APIs to perform actions that are less likely to be detected, which aligns with the described evasion technique.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using native Windows APIs to hide the dialog and avoid displaying on the Taskbar.

**Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API**
