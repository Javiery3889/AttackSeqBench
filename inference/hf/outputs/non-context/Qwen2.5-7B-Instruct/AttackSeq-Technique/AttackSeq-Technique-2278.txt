To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Regin progressed to loading kernel drivers, we need to understand the typical stages of the Regin malware's lifecycle and how it interacts with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question mentions that Regin has a multi-staged architecture and that loading kernel drivers is a later stage.
   - We need to identify which technique would logically precede the loading of kernel drivers.

2. **Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1546.016-Installer Packages** - This technique involves the use of installer packages to deploy malware. It is a common initial stage where malware is delivered to the target system.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules** - This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. It is a step that can occur after initial delivery but before deeper system integration.
   - **C: T1059.001-PowerShell** - This technique involves the use of PowerShell to execute commands or scripts. It is often used for initial or intermediate stages of an attack.
   - **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol** - This technique involves the exfiltration of data over a protocol other than the one used for normal communication. It is a later stage of the attack lifecycle, typically after the malware has established a foothold.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Delivery (T1546.016-Installer Packages):** This is the first step where the malware is delivered to the target system.
   - **Execution (T1059.001-PowerShell):** After delivery, the malware might use PowerShell to execute commands or scripts, which is a common intermediate step.
   - **Loading Kernel Drivers (T1547.003-Load Custom Kernel-Mode Driver):** This is a deeper integration step where the malware loads a custom kernel driver to gain more persistent and stealthy access.

Given the sequence of steps, the most plausible technique that would occur before loading kernel drivers is the execution of commands or scripts, which is best represented by T1059.001-PowerShell.

**Final Answer: C: T1059.001-PowerShell**
