To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Phosphorus group leveraged ProxyShell vulnerabilities to gain access to the Microsoft Exchange Server.**
   - This indicates an initial exploitation of a publicly known vulnerability (ProxyShell) to gain access to a system.

2. **Deployed the PowerLess Backdoor.**
   - This suggests that after gaining access, the attackers installed a backdoor to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
   - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. While this is relevant to the initial access via ProxyShell, it does not describe the deployment of a backdoor.

B. **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
   - This technique involves compromising a user's system without their interaction, typically through a malicious website. This does not align with the scenario of gaining access to a specific server and deploying a backdoor.

C. **T1071.004-DNS**
   - This technique involves modifying DNS records to redirect traffic. While this can be a method to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data, it is not directly related to deploying a backdoor.

D. **T1112-Modify Registry**
   - This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to maintain persistence. Deploying a backdoor often requires modifying system settings to ensure it remains active and undetected. This aligns well with the action of deploying a backdoor.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The initial access is via a vulnerability (ProxyShell).
2. The next step is to deploy a backdoor to maintain control.
3. Among the given options, T1112-Modify Registry is the most relevant to the action of deploying a backdoor.

**Final Answer: D**
