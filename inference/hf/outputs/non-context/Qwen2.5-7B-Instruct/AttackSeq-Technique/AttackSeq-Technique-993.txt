Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions initial access through a phishing email and the use of a VBS script to drop a JavaScript backdoor. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique (Phishing: Email) and T1098 (File and Directory Discovery) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Obfuscation and Execution**: The malware then executes an obfuscated script and loads a DLL file in memory. This indicates a technique that involves running code in memory without writing it to the disk, which is a common tactic to evade detection.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a command and control channel. It does not align with the execution of an obfuscated script and loading a DLL in memory.
   - **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**: This technique is about hiding malicious content in email messages. While it relates to the initial phishing email, it does not describe the execution of an obfuscated script and loading a DLL in memory.
   - **C: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code. This aligns well with the execution of an obfuscated script and loading a DLL in memory, as DLLs are shared libraries that can be loaded into memory.
   - **D: T1559.001-Component Object Model**: This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code. While it can be used to load DLLs, it is more specific to COM-based systems and does not directly describe the obfuscation and in-memory execution of a script.

4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is best represented by T1129-Shared Modules, as it directly addresses the loading of a DLL in memory.

Final Answer: C
