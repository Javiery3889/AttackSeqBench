To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

1. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - The scenario mentions the deployment of a backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code.
   - It also notes that an Iron group's installer checked for VM execution and dropped a backdoor DLL.

2. **Answer Choices Evaluation:**
   - **A: T1053.002-At**: This technique involves using a service to maintain persistence. However, the scenario does not specifically mention the use of a service.
   - **B: T1610-Deploy Container**: This technique involves using containers to host malicious code. The scenario does not mention the use of containers.
   - **C: T1569-System Services**: This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence. Given that a backdoor DLL was dropped, it is plausible that the next step would be to use a system service to ensure the backdoor remains active.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding the presence of malicious artifacts. While hiding artifacts is a common practice, the scenario does not specifically mention the need to hide the backdoor DLL or the service used.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The scenario describes the deployment of a backdoor and the use of a DLL.
   - The next logical step would be to ensure the backdoor remains active, which is typically done by using a system service.
   - T1569-System Services (C) directly aligns with this need to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: C: T1569-System Services**
