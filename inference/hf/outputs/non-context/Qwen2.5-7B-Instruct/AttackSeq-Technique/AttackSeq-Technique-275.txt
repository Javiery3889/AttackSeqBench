Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Initial TTP**: The question mentions that the attack starts with the execution of an embedded .hta file via `mshta.exe`. This is a technique to execute malicious scripts and is often used for initial access.

2. **Identify the Goal**: The goal is to maintain the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by automatically executing files at regular intervals. This indicates a persistence mechanism.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1070.001-Clear Windows Event Logs**: This technique is used to remove evidence of the attack by clearing event logs. It does not align with the goal of maintaining persistence.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to run at regular intervals, which aligns with the goal of maintaining persistence by ensuring the Trojan runs periodically.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain access. It does not align with the goal of maintaining persistence.
   - **D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**: This technique involves changing file associations to execute malicious code when a specific file type is opened. While it can be used for persistence, it is not the most direct method for maintaining regular execution.

4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs to maintain the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by automatically executing files at regular intervals is through the creation of a scheduled task or job.

Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
