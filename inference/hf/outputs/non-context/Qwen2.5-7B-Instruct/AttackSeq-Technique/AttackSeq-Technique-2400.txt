Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by malware:
     - Process hollowing (T1055) for defense evasion.
     - Evading detection while executing the second-stage payload.
     - Collecting information about active processes on the infected host.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique corresponds to the last step, where the malware starts collecting information about active processes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions**
     - This technique is related to email permissions and is not relevant to process information collection.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique is about establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which is not related to collecting process information.
   - **C: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry, which is not directly related to collecting information about active processes.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and listing running processes on a system, which aligns with the step of collecting information about active processes.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs, starting with process hollowing (T1055) and evasion techniques.
   - The final step is collecting information about active processes, which is directly related to the T1057-Process Discovery technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery**
