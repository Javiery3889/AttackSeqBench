Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Obfuscating the VBA-Macro with thematically chosen variable names**: This technique is aimed at hindering analysis, which is a common tactic to avoid detection. However, this action itself does not establish communication with a domain.

2. **Dropping a file from a specified URL**: This action involves downloading a file, which is a step towards establishing a foothold on the target system. The file 'nanagrams.exe' is then executed.

3. **Establishing communication with the URL's domain**: This implies that the attacker is using the domain to communicate with the C2 server, which is a typical behavior in many cyber attacks.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or establish a command and control channel. While this could be part of the communication, it does not directly address the establishment of the initial communication with the domain.

B. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using deceptive communication to trick the user into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. While phishing could be a method to get the user to visit the URL, it does not directly address the communication with the domain.

C. **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves maintaining access to a system even if the initial access vector is detected and mitigated. While this could be relevant in the context of maintaining access, it does not directly address the initial communication with the domain.

D. **T1650-Acquire Access**: This technique involves gaining access to a system, which can include downloading and executing malware. Establishing communication with a domain to execute a file is a clear step in acquiring access.

Given the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that directly addresses the establishment of communication with the domain to execute the malware.

**Final Answer: D: T1650-Acquire Access**
