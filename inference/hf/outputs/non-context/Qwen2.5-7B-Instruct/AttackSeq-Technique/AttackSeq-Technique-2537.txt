Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions "fake Japanese documents" to gain initial access.
   - It then asks about a technique that occurred before the malware retrieved encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1497.001-System Checks:** This technique involves checking the system to determine if it is suitable for the attacker's purposes. While it could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly relate to the initial access or the retrieval of C&C information.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves ensuring the malware starts automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This is more about persistence and not directly related to the initial access or the retrieval of C&C information.
   - **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts:** This technique involves creating or modifying local user accounts. This could be a step in establishing persistence or gaining more access, but it doesn't directly relate to the initial access or the retrieval of C&C information.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using a web service to establish a C2 channel. Given that the question mentions retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs, this technique aligns well with the retrieval of C&C information from web-based sources.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of TTPs should logically flow from initial access to the retrieval of C&C information. The initial access is through fake Japanese documents, and the next step would be to establish a method to retrieve the C&C information, which would be a web service.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
