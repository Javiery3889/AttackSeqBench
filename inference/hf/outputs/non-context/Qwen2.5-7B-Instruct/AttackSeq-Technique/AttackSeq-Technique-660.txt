Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that the attack started with spear-phishing emails containing malicious Office documents that leverage the DDE protocol. This aligns with the ATT&CK technique T1566.001 (Exploit Public Vulnerability) or T1190 (Phishing: Email).

2. **Living Off the Land (LotL) Tactics**: Gallmaker then used LotL tactics, which means using legitimate tools and utilities on the victim's system to maintain persistence and avoid detection. This aligns with T1097 (Living off the Land).

3. **Tool Removal**: The question states that Gallmaker removed tools from the victim machines to avoid detection. This aligns with T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host).

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1218.004-InstallUtil**: This technique involves using the InstallUtil.exe tool to install a malicious payload. While it is a legitimate tool used for installing .NET assemblies, it does not directly align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

B. **T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves forging or stealing web credentials. It does not align with the sequence of TTPs described, as it does not follow the initial access via spear-phishing and does not involve LotL tactics or tool removal.

C. **T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using a physical medium. It does not align with the sequence of TTPs described, as it does not follow the initial access via spear-phishing and does not involve LotL tactics or tool removal.

D. **T1070-Indicator Removal on Host**: This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from the host to avoid detection. This aligns with the final step in the sequence described in the question, where Gallmaker removed tools from the victim machines to avoid detection.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible answer is the one that aligns with the final step of removing tools to avoid detection.

Final Answer: D
