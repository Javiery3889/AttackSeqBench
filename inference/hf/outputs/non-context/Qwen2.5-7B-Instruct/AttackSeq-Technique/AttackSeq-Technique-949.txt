To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Sednit's downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports, let's analyze each option in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1568-Dynamic Resolution (A)**: This technique involves the use of dynamic DNS resolution to map a domain name to an IP address at runtime. While this can be used to establish communications, it is not specifically about the encryption or encoding of data, nor is it a prerequisite for the encrypted and hex-encoded data communications.

2. **T1113-Screen Capture (B)**: This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen. It is unrelated to the establishment of encrypted and hex-encoded communications and does not seem to be a prerequisite for the described communications method.

3. **T1573-Encrypted Channel (C)**: This technique involves the use of encryption to secure communications. While this is related to the described communications method, it is more about the method of securing the communication rather than a step that would occur before the actual establishment of the encrypted and hex-encoded data communications.

4. **T1547.012-Print Processors (D)**: This technique involves the use of print spooler services to execute malicious code. This could be a step that occurs before the downloaders and backdoors are established, as it could be used to prepare the environment for the downloaders and backdoors. However, it does not directly relate to the encrypted and hex-encoded data communications.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence would be a technique that prepares the environment for the downloaders and backdoors, rather than a technique that directly involves the encrypted and hex-encoded data communications.

**Final Answer: D: T1547.012-Print Processors**
