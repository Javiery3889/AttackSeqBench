Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Earth Lusca used adfind and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
2. Network configuration and domain information were gathered.
3. Spear phishing emails with malicious links were sent to gain initial access.

We need to identify the TTP that logically follows the reconnaissance phase but precedes the spear phishing emails.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

**A: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal**
- This technique involves bypassing network address translation (NAT) to access internal networks. It does not directly relate to the reconnaissance or spear phishing phases described in the question.

**B: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
- This technique involves the use of digital certificates to establish trust and legitimacy. While it can be part of a broader attack, it is not a direct TTP that would follow reconnaissance and precede spear phishing.

**C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
- This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in control mechanisms to gain elevated privileges. It is more about gaining access or maintaining persistence rather than reconnaissance or spear phishing.

**D: T1595-Active Scanning**
- This technique involves actively scanning networks to discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities. It directly follows the reconnaissance phase (using adfind and PowerSploit) and precedes actions like sending spear phishing emails to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reconnaissance Phase**: Earth Lusca used adfind and PowerSploit to gather network configuration and domain information.
- **Next Step**: The next logical step would be to actively scan the network to discover more details and potential targets, which aligns with T1595-Active Scanning.
- **Final Step**: After gathering more detailed information through active scanning, the attackers would then proceed to send spear phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access.

### Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning
