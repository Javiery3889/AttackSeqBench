Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors first acquire servers through compromise or legitimate purchase.
   - They then use these servers to configure malicious infrastructure for Command and Control (C2) purposes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is acquiring servers.
   - The second TTP is configuring these servers for C2 purposes.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
     - This technique involves sending a malicious attachment via email to trick the recipient into executing the payload. It does not align with the sequence of acquiring servers and configuring them for C2.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the target's environment to better understand and exploit it. While it could be part of the initial reconnaissance, it does not directly align with acquiring and configuring servers for C2.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection to the target network. This could be part of the C2 infrastructure setup, but it does not directly address the acquisition and configuration of servers.
   - **D: T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying local or domain groups to gain additional access or privileges. While it could be part of the post-compromise phase, it does not directly address the acquisition and configuration of servers for C2.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves acquiring servers and then configuring them for C2 purposes. The technique that best fits this description is T1133-External Remote Services, as it directly relates to establishing a connection and infrastructure for C2.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
