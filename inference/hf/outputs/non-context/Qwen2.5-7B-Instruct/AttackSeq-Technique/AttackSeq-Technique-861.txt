Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Key hosts were used as beachheads.
   - Conpee or Etso tools were deployed.
   - Scheduled system tasks were added using compromised credentials from pwdump6.

2. **Focus on C2 Communication:**
   - The question specifies that C2 communication used port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols:** This technique involves using mail protocols for command and control (C2) communication. It does not specifically address non-HTTPS traffic on port 443.
   - **B: T1595-Active Scanning:** This technique involves scanning networks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. It does not pertain to C2 communication.
   - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. However, it does not specify the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
   - **D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:** This technique involves acquiring or establishing infrastructure to support the adversary's operations, which can include C2 communication. It can involve using standard ports (like 443) for non-HTTPS traffic, which aligns with the question's description.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS C2 communication is T1583-Acquire Infrastructure, as it can encompass the use of standard ports for non-standard purposes.

Final Answer: D
