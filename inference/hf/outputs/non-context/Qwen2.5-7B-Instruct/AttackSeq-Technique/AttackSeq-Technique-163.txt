To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Reconnaissance**: Charming Kitten targeted individuals of interest with spear-phishing emails and SMS to gather information about their phone numbers. This is a form of reconnaissance to gather information about potential victims.

2. **Initial Access**: The next step mentioned is the use of spear-phishing methods to achieve initial access through impersonation of legitimate services. This implies that the attackers have already gained a foothold or initial access to the target's system.

Given this sequence, we need to find a TTP that logically follows reconnaissance and precedes the use of spear-phishing for initial access.

- **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing or enhancing capabilities to support the adversary's objectives. While it is a valid TTP, it does not directly follow the described sequence of gathering information and then using that information for initial access.

- **B: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or clipboard contents. While it can be a method to gain initial access, it does not directly follow the described sequence of gathering information about phone numbers and then using that information for initial access.

- **C: T1583.001-Domains**: This technique involves the use of domains for command and control (C2) or other purposes. While it can be used for initial access, it does not directly follow the described sequence of gathering information about phone numbers and then using that information for initial access.

- **D: T1550.002-Pass the Hash**: This technique involves using stolen hashes to gain access to systems. This TTP directly follows the gathering of information about phone numbers and the use of spear-phishing for initial access, as the stolen hashes can be used to impersonate legitimate services and gain initial access.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible TTP that follows the gathering of information about phone numbers and precedes the use of spear-phishing for initial access is T1550.002-Pass the Hash.

Final Answer: D
