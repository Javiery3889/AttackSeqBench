To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attacker connected to the C2 server using the CARBANAK RAT and executed additional payloads through reflection methods to establish backdoor access, let's analyze each option in the context of the described sequence of TTPs.

1. **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves the use of native APIs to perform actions on the system. While it is a common method for maintaining persistence and evading detection, it does not directly relate to the initial connection to the C2 server or the use of CARBANAK RAT.

2. **T1059.008-Network Device CLI**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces to interact with network devices. It is more related to administrative access and network device management rather than the initial connection to a C2 server or the use of a RAT.

3. **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: This technique involves the use of non-standard ports for communication, which can help in evading network monitoring and detection. This is a plausible technique to use before connecting to a C2 server, as it can help the attacker avoid detection by network security measures.

4. **T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves infecting shared content (e.g., documents, web pages) to spread malware. While it is a common method for initial compromise, it does not directly relate to the connection to a C2 server or the use of CARBANAK RAT.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique that would occur before connecting to the C2 server and using CARBANAK RAT is one that helps in establishing a covert channel or evading detection. **T1571-Non-Standard Port** fits this description well, as using non-standard ports can help the attacker avoid detection by network security measures and establish a connection to the C2 server more stealthily.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
