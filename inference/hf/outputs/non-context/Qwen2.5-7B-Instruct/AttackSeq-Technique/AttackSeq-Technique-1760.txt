To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a malicious document containing a custom Pterodo backdoor. This is a form of initial access, which is typically categorized under T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) or T1543 (Exploit Public-Facing Service) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, but the specific technique is not mentioned in the question.

2. **Persistence**: After initial access, the attacker uses VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence. This is a form of persistence, which is categorized under T1090 (System Binary/Script Tampering) or T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique is related to stealing financial information, which is not directly related to the persistence mechanism described in the question.

B. **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves creating or modifying system files or registry entries to ensure that malware is executed when the system boots or when a user logs on. This aligns well with the use of VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain persistence.

C. **T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**: This technique involves the use of dynamic data exchange protocols to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the persistence mechanism described in the question.

D. **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to run malware at a later time. While this can be a method of persistence, it is not as directly aligned with the use of VBS scripts and HTA files as T1547.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
