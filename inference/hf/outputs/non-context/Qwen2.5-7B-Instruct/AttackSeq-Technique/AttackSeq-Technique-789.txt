To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions that the attacker used stackstrings obfuscation to hide its mechanisms.
   - After obfuscation, the attacker performed reconnaissance activities using tools like a NetBIOS scanner and built-in Windows networking utilities.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying services running on a network. While it is a form of reconnaissance, it does not directly relate to the use of stackstrings for obfuscation.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not align with the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **C: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying security software on a system, which is a form of reconnaissance. It could be a step before using tools like a NetBIOS scanner to gather more information.
   - **D: T1550.001-Application Access Token**
     - This technique involves stealing or misusing application access tokens to gain elevated privileges. It is more about privilege escalation rather than reconnaissance.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attacker first uses stackstrings to obfuscate their mechanisms, which is a technique to avoid detection.
   - After obfuscation, the attacker needs to gather information about the network and systems, which is the purpose of reconnaissance.
   - Among the given choices, T1518.001-Security Software Discovery is the most relevant to the initial reconnaissance phase, as it involves identifying security software, which can provide insights into the network and system configurations.

**Final Answer: C: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**
