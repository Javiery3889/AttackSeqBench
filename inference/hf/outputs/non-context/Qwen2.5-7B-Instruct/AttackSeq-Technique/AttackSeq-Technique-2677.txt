Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence starts with a malicious executable replacing an application bundle and leaving a decoy document.
   - The next step is to ensure that the OceanLotus backdoor runs when the victim's host starts up.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The goal is to ensure the backdoor runs at startup, which means the technique should be related to persistence mechanisms that are triggered when the system boots up.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a system process to maintain persistence. However, it does not specifically target startup execution.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique is about gathering information about the system, which is not directly related to ensuring the backdoor runs at startup.
   - **C: T1124-System Time Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not relevant to ensuring the backdoor runs at startup.
   - **D: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
     - This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load a DLL into the shell32 process, which can be used to ensure that a malicious DLL is loaded every time the system starts up. This is a common method for ensuring persistence and running at startup.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is about ensuring the backdoor runs at startup.
   - Among the given options, T1546.010-AppInit DLLs is the only technique that directly addresses the need for persistence and startup execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
