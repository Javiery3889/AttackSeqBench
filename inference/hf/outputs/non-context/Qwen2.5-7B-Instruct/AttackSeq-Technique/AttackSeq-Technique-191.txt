Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Infamous Chisel collects files from local system and application directories.
   - The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first TTP is the collection of files.
   - The second TTP is the exfiltration of these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** - This technique involves automated exfiltration of data, which aligns with the exfiltration step using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration** - This is the same as A, so it's redundant.
   - **C: T1614-System Location Discovery** - This technique involves discovering the location of systems, which is not related to the exfiltration process.
   - **D: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood** - This technique involves flooding the operating system with requests to exhaust resources, which is not related to the exfiltration process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is asking for the technique that describes the exfiltration of files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - T1020-Automated Exfiltration (both A and B) is the correct technique as it involves automated exfiltration methods, which can include using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for secure and stealthy data exfiltration.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: A (or B, as they are the same)
