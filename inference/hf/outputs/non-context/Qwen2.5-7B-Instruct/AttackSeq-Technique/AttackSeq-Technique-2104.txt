Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. The attackers used anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection.
2. After this, they gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS version, and anti-virus details.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

#### A: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
- **Description**: This technique involves removing obfuscation or encoding from files or information to make them usable.
- **Context**: This technique is more about processing or preparing data rather than gathering information about the victim's system. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.

#### B: T1078.001 - Default Accounts
- **Description**: This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to a system.
- **Context**: This technique is about gaining initial access, not about gathering information about the victim's system. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.

#### C: T1573 - Encrypted Channel
- **Description**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.
- **Context**: This technique is about maintaining communication or exfiltration, not about gathering information about the victim's system. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.

#### D: T1546.010 - AppInit DLLs
- **Description**: This technique involves using AppInit DLLs to load malicious code into the Windows shell.
- **Context**: This technique is about loading malicious code, which could be part of the infection chain. However, it does not directly relate to gathering information about the victim's system. It is more about the initial infection phase.

### Step 3: Determine the Most Plausible Sequence
Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP that occurs after anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques and before gathering detailed information about the victim's system is likely to be a technique that involves establishing a foothold or initial access. However, none of the provided options directly fit this description.

### Conclusion
Since none of the provided options perfectly fit the sequence described in the question, the closest match would be a technique that involves establishing a foothold, which is not explicitly listed. However, based on the provided choices, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: D: T1546.010 - AppInit DLLs** 

This is because it is the closest to being part of the infection chain and could be a step before gathering detailed information about the victim's system.
