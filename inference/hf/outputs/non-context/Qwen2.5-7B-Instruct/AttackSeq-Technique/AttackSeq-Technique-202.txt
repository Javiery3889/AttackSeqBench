Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary (FamousSparrow) has exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the adversary ran commands to install SparrowDoor.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities (for initial access).
     2. Running commands to install SparrowDoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves acquiring or establishing infrastructure for the purpose of conducting an attack. It does not directly relate to the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities or running commands to install software.
   - **B: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**
     - This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to execute code. While it could be a method of exploiting remote code execution, it is not directly related to the installation of software.
   - **C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**
     - This technique involves using a virtual private server (VPS) to host or control infrastructure. It is not directly related to the exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities or running commands to install software.
   - **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it could be used in conjunction with the installation of SparrowDoor, it does not directly describe the process of gaining execution by running commands.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs in the given context is the direct action of running commands to install SparrowDoor after gaining initial access via remote code execution.
   - The technique that best fits the action of running commands to install software is not explicitly listed in the provided choices. However, the closest and most relevant technique would be one that involves the direct execution of commands, which is not explicitly listed.

Given the choices provided, none of them directly match the action of running commands to install software. However, if we must choose the closest one, **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** (D) is the closest in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as it involves actions that could be taken after the installation of SparrowDoor to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: D**
