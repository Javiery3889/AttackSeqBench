To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Grandoreiro Maintains Persistence**: This is mentioned as the first step, where Grandoreiro creates a `.LNK` file in the Windows startup directory. This aligns with the T1543.003 - Persistence via Registry Key or Registry Run Key technique, but it is not listed in the answer choices.

2. **Collects Information about Installed Security Products and Banking Protection Software**: This step involves gathering information about security software, which is a form of reconnaissance. The most relevant technique here would be T1082 - Reconnaissance, but it is not listed in the answer choices.

3. **Identifying the Preceding Technique**: The question asks which technique most likely occurred before the collection of information. Given the context, the technique should be one that would enable the malware to gather information about the system's security posture, which would help in evading detection or tailoring its behavior to avoid security measures.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1496.003-SMS Pumping**: This technique involves using SMS to exfiltrate data. It does not align with the context of collecting information about security products.

- **B: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves degrading, disrupting, or removing defensive measures. While it could be a step in the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the collection of information about security products.

- **C: T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying software and services running on the target system. This directly aligns with the need to gather information about installed security products and banking protection software.

- **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves evading detection by virtualization or sandbox environments. While it is a common technique, it does not directly relate to the collection of information about security products.

Given the context and the need to gather information about security products, the most plausible technique that would precede this step is T1518-Software Discovery.

**Final Answer: C**
