Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The Babar's implant reduces forensic artifacts by executing a `cmd.exe` process to delete the dropper binary from the disk.
   - After this, it actively steals data from applications using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication:** This technique involves the use of inter-process communication mechanisms to exfiltrate data or control processes. It does not directly relate to the deletion of files or the use of hooks and keyloggers.
   - **B: T1021.004-SSH:** This technique involves using SSH to establish a remote connection. It is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it could be related to the deletion of the dropper binary, it does not directly describe the active data theft using hooks and keyloggers.
   - **D: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations:** This technique involves modifying cloud compute configurations to gain unauthorized access or control. It is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the implant deleting the dropper binary and then actively stealing data using hooks and a keylogger. The technique that best fits the active data theft part is T1059.002, which involves using process injection to inject malicious code into a legitimate process. However, since T1059.002 is not an option, we need to choose the closest match.

Given the options, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to the active data theft using hooks and keyloggers. The closest match to this in the provided options is T1059.002, which is not listed, but the closest related technique in the list is T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information, which could be indirectly related to the deletion of the dropper binary.

**Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
