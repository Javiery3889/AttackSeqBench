Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an XAgent app on iOS 7 hides its icon and runs in the background.
   - The next step in the sequence is collecting geo-location data from the device.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     1. Hiding the app icon and running in the background.
     2. Collecting geo-location data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or analysis. It does not directly relate to collecting geo-location data.
   - **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**
     - This technique involves using pluggable authentication modules to bypass authentication mechanisms. It is not related to collecting geo-location data.
   - **C: T1614-System Location Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the location of a system or device. It directly aligns with the task of collecting geo-location data.
   - **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the identity of the system owner or user. It does not relate to collecting geo-location data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the collection of geo-location data.
   - Among the given options, only T1614-System Location Discovery (C) is directly related to the collection of location data.

**Final Answer: C**
