Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions exploiting CVE-2015-2545 via spear phishing emails. This aligns with the T1566-Phishing technique, but it is not part of the sequence we are evaluating for the next step.

2. **Persistence**: The question states that persistence was achieved using an ActiveSetup registry key. This aligns with the T1543.003-Registry Run Keys/Paths technique, but again, it is not part of the sequence we are evaluating for the next step.

3. **Communication with Attacker's Infrastructure**: The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure after achieving persistence.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves the use of application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to exfiltrate data or to establish a command and control (C2) channel. This is a plausible method for communicating with the attacker's infrastructure.

- **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves using legitimate system or application features to perform actions that would otherwise require elevated privileges. This is not related to communication with the attacker's infrastructure.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware or to obtain sensitive information. This is related to the initial access step, not the communication step.

- **D: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to bypass external network security controls. While this could be a method of communication, it is not as common or direct as using application layer protocols for C2.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for communicating with the attacker's infrastructure after achieving persistence would be using an application layer protocol.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
