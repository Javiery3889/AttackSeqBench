To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the final step in disrupting the bank's operations during the FEIB heist, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the Lazarus group's actions and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **T1202-Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves executing commands through an intermediary, which is not directly related to disrupting operations or deleting data. It is more about obfuscating the command execution process.

2. **T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**: This technique involves using the `regsvcs` or `regasm` command to register or unregister COM+ components. While it can be used to modify system behavior, it is not specifically aimed at disrupting operations or deleting critical data.

3. **T1485.001-Lifecycle-Triggered Deletion**: This technique involves deleting files or data based on certain conditions or triggers. Given that the Lazarus group's goal was to disrupt the bank's operations, this technique aligns well with the need to delete critical data or files that could prevent the bank from functioning properly.

4. **T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**: This technique involves encrypting data to render it unusable. While this can disrupt operations, it is more about rendering data unusable rather than deleting it, which might not be the final step in a disruption strategy.

Given the context of the FEIB heist and the Lazarus group's likely objective to disrupt the bank's operations, the most plausible final step would be to delete critical data or files that are essential for the bank's operations. This aligns with the T1485.001-Lifecycle-Triggered Deletion technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1485.001-Lifecycle-Triggered Deletion**
