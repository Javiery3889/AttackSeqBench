Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions an obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe'.
   - Post-execution, the script deletes itself to evade detection.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using a web service to exfiltrate data or download additional malware. It does not align with the described TTP of executing a VBS script and deleting itself.
   - **B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**: This technique involves using legitimate identities to blend in with normal user behavior. It does not align with the described TTP of executing a VBS script and deleting itself.
   - **C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**: This technique involves reopening applications to maintain persistence or evade detection. While it deals with application re-opening, it does not directly address the deletion of the script post-execution.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding or removing evidence of an attack to evade detection. The described TTP of deleting the script post-execution aligns well with this technique.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1564-Hide Artifacts, as it directly addresses the action of deleting the script to evade detection.

Final Answer: D
