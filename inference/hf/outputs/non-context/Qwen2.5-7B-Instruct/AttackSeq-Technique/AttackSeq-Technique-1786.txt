To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP**: The attackers performed privilege escalation using Mimikatz for credential dumping. This is a common technique to gain higher-level access on the network.

2. **Subsequent TTP**: The question asks which technique most likely followed to bypass application whitelisting and security software. This implies that the attackers need to execute malicious code or actions that would typically be blocked by security measures.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching**: This technique involves using the `sudo` command to run commands with elevated privileges. However, this is more relevant in Unix/Linux environments and does not directly address bypassing application whitelisting and security software.

B. **T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about accounts and their permissions. While it can be part of reconnaissance, it does not directly address bypassing security measures.

C. **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to run malicious code. This can be used to bypass application whitelisting and security software by making the malicious code appear as legitimate.

D. **T1080-Taint Shared Content**: This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. While it can be effective, it does not directly address bypassing application whitelisting and security software.

Given the context of bypassing application whitelisting and security software, **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** (C) is the most plausible technique. It directly addresses the need to modify the execution flow to run malicious code, which can help in evading detection.

**Final Answer: C**
