Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions a sequence of TTPs where POWERSHOWER communicates with a C2 server based on the status code of a GET request.
   - It also mentions that the Inception attackers gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through remote templates in Microsoft Word.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves communication with a C2 server, which suggests a form of command and control (C2) interaction.
   - The initial access is through exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882).

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies:** This technique involves manipulating network trust relationships, which doesn't directly align with the initial access via a vulnerability.
   - **B: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking:** This technique involves taking control of a system's resources, which is not directly related to the initial access or the C2 communication.
   - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal:** This technique involves removing indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to the initial access or the C2 communication.
   - **D: T1598-Phishing for Information:** This technique involves using phishing to obtain information, which is not directly related to the initial access via a vulnerability.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The initial access is through a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882), which aligns with a technique that involves exploiting a software vulnerability.
   - The C2 communication suggests a technique that involves establishing and maintaining a connection with a C2 server.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the initial exploitation of a vulnerability followed by establishing a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: None of the provided answer choices directly align with the initial access via a vulnerability and the subsequent C2 communication. However, if we must choose the closest one, T1598-Phishing for Information (D) is the least unrelated, as it involves social engineering, which can be a precursor to exploiting vulnerabilities.**

Final Answer: D: T1598-Phishing for Information
