To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Stolen Credentials**: The question mentions that Whitefly utilizes stolen credentials to compromise additional machines within the network. This indicates that the initial step involves obtaining credentials, which aligns with the T1003-OS Credential Dumping technique.

2. **Compromise Additional Machines**: After obtaining the credentials, the next step is to use them to compromise additional machines. This step is a direct result of the stolen credentials and is a common follow-up to T1003.

3. **Mapping the Network**: The question states that the next step is to map the network and identify further systems for infection. This is a logical step after compromising additional machines, as the attacker needs to understand the network topology to identify and target more systems.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1657-Financial Theft**: This technique is related to stealing financial information, which does not align with the sequence described in the question. The question focuses on network compromise and credential theft, not financial data.

- **B: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: This technique involves discovering containers and resources, which is not directly related to the initial steps of compromising machines with stolen credentials.

- **C: T1018-Remote System Discovery**: This technique involves discovering remote systems, which is a step that would logically follow the compromise of additional machines. However, it is more about identifying systems rather than the initial step of using stolen credentials.

- **D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which directly aligns with the first step of the sequence described in the question. It is the most logical and direct precursor to using the stolen credentials to compromise additional machines.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the alignment with the attack described, the most plausible sequence starts with T1003-OS Credential Dumping.

**Final Answer: D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
