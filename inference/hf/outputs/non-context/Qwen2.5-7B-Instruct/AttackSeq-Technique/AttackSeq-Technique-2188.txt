Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the attackers used HTTP-based communication with RC4 encryption for command and control (C2).
   - The next step in the sequence is to transfer data from the infected machines to the attacker's C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is HTTP-based communication with RC4 encryption for C2.
   - The next TTP should logically be the method used to transfer data from the infected machines to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1564.005-Hidden File System:** This technique involves creating hidden files or directories to hide malicious activities. It does not directly relate to data exfiltration over a C2 channel.
   - **B: T1567.001-Exfiltration to Code Repository:** This technique involves exfiltrating data to a code repository, which is not directly related to the C2 channel described in the question.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel:** This technique involves using an encrypted channel for data exfiltration. While it is related to encryption, it does not specifically mention the C2 channel.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:** This technique directly involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communication, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.

Final Answer: D
