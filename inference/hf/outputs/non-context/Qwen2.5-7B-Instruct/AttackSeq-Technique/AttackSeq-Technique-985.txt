To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **InfoOS Module**: This module is likely gathering system information, which is a common initial step in reconnaissance.
2. **RemoteShell Module**: This module is used to list installed applications and iPhone backups, which is a form of Discovery, as it helps the attacker understand the environment and potential targets.

Given these steps, the next logical TTP would be one that involves further exploration or exploitation of the gathered information. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves setting up a proxy to intercept and modify network traffic. While it can be used for various purposes, it doesn't directly follow the Discovery phase described.

B. **T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying processes running on a system. Since the RemoteShell module has already listed installed applications and backups, the next step would likely be to discover more details about the running processes to understand the system's behavior and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

C. **T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input from graphical user interfaces. While it can be useful for stealing credentials or other sensitive information, it is not the most direct next step after Discovery.

D. **T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While it can be useful, it is more of a passive technique and might not be the immediate next step after the Discovery phase.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the need to understand the system further after Discovery, the most plausible next step is to discover more about the running processes.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
