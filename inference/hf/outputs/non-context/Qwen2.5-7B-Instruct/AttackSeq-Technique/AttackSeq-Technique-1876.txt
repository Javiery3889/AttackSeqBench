To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and each answer choice step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where FIN13 (a known APT group) establishes initial access to a victim network through the exploitation of external servers, specifically using consistent gateways like web shells. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice

#### A: T1596.004-CDNs
- **Description**: This technique involves the use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host malicious content.
- **Relevance**: While CDNs can be used to host malicious content, the question specifically mentions the use of external servers and web shells. CDNs are not directly mentioned in the context of the question.

#### B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection
- **Description**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into image files to execute when the image is opened.
- **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the exploitation of external servers or the use of web shells. It is more about embedding malicious code in image files, which is not the context of the question.

#### C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
- **Description**: This technique involves transferring tools into the target network, often through the use of external servers or other means.
- **Relevance**: This technique directly aligns with the scenario described in the question. It involves the use of external servers and web shells to establish initial access, which is the first step in the attack sequence.

#### D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information
- **Description**: This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network to better understand and exploit it.
- **Relevance**: While gathering network information is a common step in an attack, it typically occurs after initial access has been established. The question specifically asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the initial access through the exploitation of external servers.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The question describes the use of external servers and web shells to establish initial access.
- **Step 2**: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (C) directly involves the transfer of tools into the target network through external servers, which aligns with the scenario described.
- **Step 3**: The other techniques (A, B, and D) do not directly match the specific context of the question.

### Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
