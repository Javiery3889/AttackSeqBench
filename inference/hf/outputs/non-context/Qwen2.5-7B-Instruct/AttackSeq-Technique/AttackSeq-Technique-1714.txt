Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Mustang Panda uses spearphished '.lnk' files to deliver malicious payloads (Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX) via embedded HTA scripts.
   - The key aspect here is the deception involved in getting users to execute the malicious '.lnk' files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1036-Masquerading** - This technique involves making a malicious file or process appear to be legitimate. However, the question is more about the initial deception to get the user to open the '.lnk' file, not about disguising the file itself.
   - **B: T1070.006-Timestomp** - This technique involves altering the file timestamps to make the file appear to be legitimate or less suspicious. This is not directly related to the initial deception of the user.
   - **C: T1647-Plist File Modification** - This technique involves modifying macOS plist files to evade detection. It is not relevant to the scenario involving Windows '.lnk' files.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into performing an action, such as opening a malicious file or link. This aligns well with the scenario where users are tricked into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where users are tricked into executing malicious '.lnk' files, which is a form of social engineering.
   - Among the given options, T1566-Phishing (D) is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the social engineering aspect of deceiving users to execute the malicious files.

**Final Answer: D**
