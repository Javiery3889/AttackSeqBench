Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The initial access was gained through the exploitation of RTF files using a vulnerability (CVE-2014-1761).
   - The next step involves communication with a cloud-based infrastructure for command-and-control operations.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control (C2) communications. It is a plausible choice as it directly addresses the need for communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves the use of phishing to deliver malware or to obtain credentials. It does not directly address the communication aspect post-exploitation.
   - **C: T1048.003-Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over unencrypted protocols that are not specifically for C2. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the C2 communication aspect.
   - **D: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
     - This technique involves bidirectional communication, which is a general term for communication that can go both ways. It is plausible but more general than T1071, which is specifically about C2 communications.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about communication with a cloud-based infrastructure for C2 operations. T1071 is the most specific and relevant technique for this purpose, as it directly addresses the use of application layer protocols for C2 communications.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
