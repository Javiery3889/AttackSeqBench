Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The initial step involves exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files to gain remote access via spear phishing. This is a social engineering technique.
   - The next step is to facilitate communication between the malware and the framework's cloud infrastructure.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence starts with exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files and then moving to a technique that facilitates communication with a cloud infrastructure.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique is about using phishing to deliver malware. It does not facilitate communication with a cloud infrastructure.
   - **B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path** - This technique involves intercepting file paths, which is not related to facilitating communication with a cloud infrastructure.
   - **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the communication path. While it can be used to facilitate communication, it is not specifically about cloud infrastructure.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using a web service to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. This is directly related to facilitating communication with a cloud infrastructure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step (exploiting RTF files via spear phishing) is a delivery mechanism.
   - The next step should be a technique that allows the malware to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure, which in this case is a cloud infrastructure.
   - Among the given options, T1102-Web Service (D) is the most relevant as it directly involves using a web service to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.

**Final Answer: D**
