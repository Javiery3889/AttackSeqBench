To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor, we need to analyze the attack sequence and match it with the appropriate ATT&CK techniques.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The SombRAT backdoor utilized protocol tunneling over DNS/HTTP for communication with C2 servers.
   - It leveraged tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY for proxying.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1090-Proxy** - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary. The use of pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY for proxying aligns with this technique.
   - **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** - This technique involves transferring tools into the target environment. While the use of these tools is part of the campaign, it does not directly describe the proxying aspect.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** - This technique involves discovering network configurations. This is not directly related to the proxying aspect of the campaign.
   - **D: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** - This technique involves removing obfuscation from files or information. This is not directly related to the proxying aspect of the campaign.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The SombRAT backdoor's use of pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY for proxying is a clear indication of the use of a proxy to route traffic.
   - T1090-Proxy directly matches the use of these tools for proxying traffic over DNS/HTTP.

**Final Answer: A: T1090-Proxy**
