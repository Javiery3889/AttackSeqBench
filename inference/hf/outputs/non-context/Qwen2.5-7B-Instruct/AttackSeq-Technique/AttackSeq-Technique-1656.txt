Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where victims are redirected to compromised websites.
   - Scripts or HTML smuggling techniques are used for malware delivery.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first step is the redirection to a compromised website.
   - The second step is the use of scripts or HTML smuggling techniques to deliver malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to a text storage site, which is not directly related to the redirection and malware delivery process described.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using deceptive communications to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. While it can lead to redirection, it does not specifically mention the use of scripts or HTML smuggling for malware delivery.
   - **C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system owner or user, which is not directly related to the redirection and malware delivery process.
   - **D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
     - This technique involves sending a malicious link to a specific individual or group. While it can lead to redirection, it does not specifically mention the use of scripts or HTML smuggling for malware delivery.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The redirection to a compromised website and the use of scripts or HTML smuggling techniques for malware delivery are more closely aligned with the concept of a malicious link or a deceptive communication that leads to the execution of malware.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is best described by a technique that involves sending a malicious link, which can lead to the redirection and subsequent malware delivery.

**Final Answer: D: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
