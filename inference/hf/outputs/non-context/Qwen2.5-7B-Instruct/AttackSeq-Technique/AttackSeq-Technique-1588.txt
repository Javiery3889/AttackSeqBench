Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions T9000, which is a technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - T9000 is associated with the use of DLL sideloading through the `igfxtray.exe` file.
   - The next step in the sequence is customizing the installation to evade 24 identified security products.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - T1129 is about using shared libraries or modules to reduce the size of the payload and evade detection. While this could be a step in the process, it doesn't directly address the evasion of security products.
   - **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - T1564 is about hiding the presence of malicious artifacts to avoid detection. This could be a step in evading security products, but it is more about hiding the artifacts rather than customizing the installation.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - T1119 involves collecting data automatically, which doesn't directly relate to the customization of the installation to evade security products.
   - **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - T1497 is about evading detection by virtualization and sandbox environments. This technique is more about evading specific types of security tools, which aligns with the need to evade 24 identified security products.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the next step after T9000 (DLL sideloading) is customizing the installation to evade 24 identified security products. Among the given choices, T1497 (Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion) is the most relevant because it directly addresses the evasion of security products, which is the next step in the sequence.

**Final Answer: D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
