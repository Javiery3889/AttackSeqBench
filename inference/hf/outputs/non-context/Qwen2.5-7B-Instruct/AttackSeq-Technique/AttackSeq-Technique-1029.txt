Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - Gamaredon used a backdoor to automatically list interesting files on the system.
   - The goal was to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The backdoor was used to automatically list files, which indicates an automated collection process.
   - The purpose was to gather sensitive documents, which involves collecting data from various sources (local system, drives, network shares).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1596.002-WHOIS** - This technique involves querying WHOIS records to gather information about domain names and IP addresses. It does not align with the described TTP of listing and collecting files.
   - **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** - This technique involves compromising the trust relationships between systems, which is not directly related to the described TTP of listing and collecting files.
   - **C: T1119-Automated Collection** - This technique involves the use of automated tools or scripts to collect data from various sources. This aligns well with the described TTP of listing and collecting files.
   - **D: T1213.001-Confluence** - This technique involves using the Confluence application to exfiltrate data. While it could be part of a broader data exfiltration strategy, it does not directly describe the automated collection of files from the local system, drives, and network shares.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1119-Automated Collection.

Final Answer: C
