To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Obtaining Domain Administrator Credentials Using Mimikatz**: This step is clearly mentioned in the question and aligns with the T1078-Valid Accounts technique, which involves the use of tools like Mimikatz to extract valid credentials.

2. **Achieving Persistence**: The next step is to install the RoyalDNS backdoor to maintain persistence. This implies that the attacker has already obtained the necessary credentials and is now looking to establish a long-term presence.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1213-Data from Information Repositories**: This technique involves gathering data from information repositories, which is not directly related to the immediate next step of achieving persistence after obtaining credentials.

B. **T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using valid accounts, which aligns with the step of obtaining domain administrator credentials. However, it does not directly lead to persistence.

C. **T1546.008-Accessibility Features**: This technique involves using accessibility features to gain or maintain access. While it could be a method to achieve persistence, it is not directly related to the immediate next step after obtaining credentials.

D. **T1606-Forge Web Credentials**: This technique involves forging web credentials, which is not directly related to the immediate next step of achieving persistence after obtaining valid credentials.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible next step after obtaining domain administrator credentials is to use those credentials to achieve persistence. The technique that best fits this step is T1546.008-Accessibility Features, as it can be used to gain or maintain access, which is a common method for achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
