Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear phishing emails delivering malicious documents containing scripts.
2. **Fetching Additional Payloads**: The scripts in the malicious documents are used to fetch additional payloads.
3. **Decoding and Executing the Main Payload**: The additional payloads are decoded from base64 text and then executed by batch files.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1559-Inter-Process Communication**: This technique involves the attacker using inter-process communication to move data between processes. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the decoding and execution of the main payload.

B. **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves the attacker exploiting a system's control mechanisms to elevate privileges. This is more about gaining higher access levels and doesn't directly relate to the decoding and execution of the main payload.

C. **T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**: This technique involves the attacker generating multi-factor authentication requests to bypass security measures. This is not relevant to the decoding and execution of the main payload.

D. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the attacker using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. This directly aligns with the decoding and execution of the main payload from base64 text using a batch file.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is that the scripts in the malicious documents are decoded and executed by a command or scripting interpreter.

**Final Answer: D**
