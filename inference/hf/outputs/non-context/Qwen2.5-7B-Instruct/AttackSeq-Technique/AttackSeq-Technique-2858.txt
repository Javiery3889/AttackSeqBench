To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and each answer choice step-by-step.

1. **Bypassing User Account Control (UAC)**: This indicates that the attacker has already gained a foothold in the system and is likely to have used a technique that allows them to bypass security measures.

2. **Installing the Nidiran back door**: This suggests that the attacker has already established a persistent presence on the system, likely through a previous step that involved gaining initial access or privilege escalation.

3. **Executing the attack on internal hosts using the back door and hacktools**: This is the final step where the attacker uses the back door to carry out the intended malicious activity.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
- This technique involves an attacker compromising a user's system through a malicious website or drive-by download. While this could be a method to initially gain access, it doesn't directly align with the sequence of installing a back door and executing an attack on internal hosts.

**B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
- This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This is more relevant to the final step of the attack rather than the initial steps leading to the installation of a back door.

**C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
- This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications to gain access. While this could be a method to initially gain access, it doesn't directly align with the sequence of installing a back door and executing an attack on internal hosts.

**D: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**
- This technique involves using a malicious attachment in a targeted email to gain initial access. This is a plausible method to initially gain access and could lead to the subsequent steps of bypassing UAC and installing a back door.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible initial step would be gaining access through a targeted method, which aligns with the use of a spearphishing attachment.

**Final Answer: D**
