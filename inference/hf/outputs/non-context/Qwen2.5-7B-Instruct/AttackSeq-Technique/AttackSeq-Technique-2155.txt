To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Phishing Campaigns**: This is the initial step where attackers use social engineering to deliver malicious content.
2. **Malicious Macro-laden Microsoft Word Documents**: These documents are likely used to execute the initial payload or to download additional malware.
3. **FlowCloud Malware**: This is the malware that sets registry key values for persistence, meaning it is a later step in the attack sequence.

### Evaluation of Each Answer Choice:

**A: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
- This technique involves calculating DNS records to evade detection. It is not directly related to the execution of a payload or setting up persistence mechanisms. It is more about DNS manipulation, which is not a typical step between phishing and malware persistence.

**B: T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM)**
- This technique involves using the Component Object Model to execute code. It is a method to run malicious code in the context of a legitimate application, which could be used to execute the payload delivered by the malicious Word document. This is a plausible step between the delivery of the Word document and the malware setting up persistence.

**C: T1129-Shared Modules**
- This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code. While this can be a method to execute code, it is not as directly relevant to the context of a Word document being used to deliver a payload and then setting up persistence.

**D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
- This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server. It is more about data exfiltration or communication, not about executing a payload or setting up persistence.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Phishing Campaigns**: Initial social engineering.
2. **Malicious Macro-laden Microsoft Word Documents**: Delivers the initial payload.
3. **T1559.001-Component Object Model (COM)**: This technique is used to execute the payload in a legitimate context, which is a plausible step between the delivery of the Word document and the malware setting up persistence.
4. **FlowCloud Malware**: Sets up registry key values for persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
