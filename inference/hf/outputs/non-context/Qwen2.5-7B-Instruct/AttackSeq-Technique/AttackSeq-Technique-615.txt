Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that include:
     - Enumerating services
     - Authenticating via brute force
     - Scanning ports
   - These actions are preparatory steps before gaining initial access, which typically involve reconnaissance and probing the target environment.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves actively scanning the target network to gather information about the network topology, services, and open ports. It aligns well with the actions of enumerating services and scanning ports.
   - **B: T1590.001-Domain Properties**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the domain, such as DNS records, domain controllers, and organizational units. While it can be part of reconnaissance, it does not directly involve enumerating services or scanning ports.
   - **C: T1197-BITS Jobs**
     - This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files. It is not related to the actions described in the question.
   - **D: T1090.002-External Proxy**
     - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. It is not related to the actions described in the question.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The actions described (enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports) are typical of the reconnaissance phase of an attack, where the attacker is trying to gather as much information as possible about the target environment.
   - T1595-Active Scanning (A) directly matches the actions of enumerating services and scanning ports, which are key parts of the reconnaissance phase.
   - The other techniques (B, C, and D) do not align with the specific actions mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: A: T1595-Active Scanning**
