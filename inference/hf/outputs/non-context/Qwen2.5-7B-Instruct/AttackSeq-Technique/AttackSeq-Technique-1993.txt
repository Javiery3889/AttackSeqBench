To determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before SkinnyBoy encoded data and exfiltrated it to its C2 server via a structured HTTP POST request, let's analyze the sequence of actions and the provided answer choices.

1. **Data Encoding (T1132)**: This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection or to bypass security measures. Since the question mentions that SkinnyBoy encoded data, this technique is directly related to the exfiltration step.

2. **Automated Collection (T1119)**: This technique involves the automated collection of data from a system. This could be a precursor to encoding and exfiltration, as data needs to be collected before it can be encoded and sent to a C2 server.

3. **Break Process Trees (T1036.009)**: This technique involves breaking the process tree to avoid detection. While this could be a step in the overall attack, it is not directly related to the data collection, encoding, or exfiltration process.

4. **Content Injection (T1659)**: This technique involves injecting content into a system, which could be used to spread malware or modify data. However, it is not directly related to the data collection, encoding, or exfiltration process described in the question.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible sequence would be:
- **Automated Collection (T1119)**: Collecting the data.
- **Data Encoding (T1132)**: Encoding the collected data.
- **Exfiltration via HTTP POST (Not a specific ATT&CK technique but a method)**: Sending the encoded data to the C2 server.

Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before encoding and exfiltration is Automated Collection.

Final Answer: D: T1119-Automated Collection
