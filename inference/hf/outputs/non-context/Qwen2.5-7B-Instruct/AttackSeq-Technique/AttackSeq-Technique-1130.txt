Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The initial access is through exploiting MS Office documents with CVE-2014-1761.
   - The goal is to determine which technique allows the BlackEnergy malware to bypass standard detection methods.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial exploitation technique is T1213.001 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) with MS Office documents.
   - The next step is to find a technique that helps the malware bypass detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1021.001 - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):** This technique involves using RDP for lateral movement or access. It does not directly relate to bypassing detection methods.
   - **B: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information:** This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. This aligns well with the goal of bypassing standard detection methods.
   - **C: T1610 - Deploy Container:** This technique involves using containers to execute malicious code. While it can help in evading detection, it is not directly related to the initial exploitation of MS Office documents.
   - **D: T1566 - Phishing:** This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malware. It does not directly relate to bypassing detection methods after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is through exploiting MS Office documents, which is a known method used by BlackEnergy.
   - To bypass detection, the malware would need to use a technique that makes it harder for security tools to identify and block it.
   - Among the options, T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) is the most relevant as it directly addresses the need to evade detection by making the malware less recognizable to security tools.

**Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
