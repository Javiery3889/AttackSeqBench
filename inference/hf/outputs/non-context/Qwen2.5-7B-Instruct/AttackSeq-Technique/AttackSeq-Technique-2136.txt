Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where scripts ('install.vbs' and 'update.vbs') are executed for Persistence.
   - These scripts are involved in scheduling tasks or managing file deletions.
   - The sequence continues with the collection of system information for Exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The scripts are used for Persistence.
   - The next step is to collect system information, which is part of the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
     - It aligns with the execution of 'install.vbs' and 'update.vbs' for Persistence.
   - **B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
     - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process.
     - It does not directly relate to the execution of scripts for Persistence or the collection of system information for Exfiltration.
   - **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying files and directories on the system.
     - While it could be part of the Exfiltration phase, it is not directly related to the execution of scripts for Persistence.
   - **D: T1654-Log Enumeration**
     - This technique involves enumerating logs to find information that could be used for Exfiltration.
     - It is more related to the Exfiltration phase and not directly to the Persistence phase.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The scripts ('install.vbs' and 'update.vbs') are used for Persistence (T1053).
   - After Persistence, the next step is to collect system information, which is part of the Exfiltration phase.
   - T1083 (File and Directory Discovery) is a common technique used in the Exfiltration phase to gather information about files and directories.

Given the sequence and the techniques involved, the most plausible sequence is from Persistence to Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
