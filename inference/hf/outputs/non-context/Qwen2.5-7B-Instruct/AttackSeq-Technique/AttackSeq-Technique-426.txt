To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The Sednit group's malware achieved initial access by executing a VBA macro to download and run the first-stage payload.
2. **Next Step**: The question asks which technique most likely occurred before ensuring persistence through a Windows registry entry.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating software on the target system. While it could be a step in the attack chain, it does not directly relate to the next step of ensuring persistence.

B. **T1542.004-ROMMONkit**: This technique involves using a ROMMON (Remote Operations Maintenance Monitor) to gain access to a device. This is not relevant to the Windows environment described in the question.

C. **T1106-Native API**: This technique involves using native Windows APIs to perform actions. This could be a step in ensuring persistence, as it involves directly interacting with the Windows operating system.

D. **T1651-Cloud Administration Command**: This technique involves using cloud services for command and control. This is not directly related to the next step of ensuring persistence on the target system.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique that would occur after the initial access and before ensuring persistence through a Windows registry entry is T1106-Native API. This technique directly involves interacting with the Windows operating system, which is a common method for ensuring persistence.

**Final Answer: C**
