Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions the deployment of scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner for network discovery.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique facilitated the movement of the malware (Earth Lusca) within the network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is network discovery, which is facilitated by scanning tools.
   - The next step is to move within the network, which is the goal of the malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying open ports and services on a network, which aligns with the use of scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner.
     - However, it does not directly facilitate movement within the network.
   - **B: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls**
     - This technique involves monitoring and controlling system calls, which could be used to gain deeper access and control over the system.
     - While it can be used to facilitate movement, it is not directly related to network discovery.
   - **C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
     - This technique involves using legitimate-looking emails to trick users into clicking on malicious links or attachments.
     - It is not directly related to network discovery or movement within the network.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system.
     - After network discovery, exploiting remote services can facilitate movement within the network by gaining access to different systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The scanning tools (HUC Port Banner Scanner) are used for network discovery (T1046).
   - To move within the network, the malware would need to exploit vulnerabilities in remote services (T1210) to gain access to different systems.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitates the movement of Earth Lusca within the network after network discovery is the exploitation of remote services.

Final Answer: D
