To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a TAIDOOR RAT (Remote Access Tool) has decrypted and executed the main malware in memory.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing communication with its C2 (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver:** This technique involves using a publicly accessible location (like a file or a web page) to exfiltrate data. It is not typically used for establishing C2 communication.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection. This is a common method for establishing C2 communication.
   - **C: T1053.003-Cron:** This technique involves using cron jobs to schedule tasks. It is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution:** This technique involves executing code in a user context. It is more about the execution of the malware rather than the communication with C2 servers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The TAIDOOR RAT has already decrypted and executed the main malware in memory.
   - The next step is to establish communication with the C2 servers.
   - Among the given options, T1571-Non-Standard Port (B) is the most relevant for establishing C2 communication, as it involves using non-standard ports to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B
