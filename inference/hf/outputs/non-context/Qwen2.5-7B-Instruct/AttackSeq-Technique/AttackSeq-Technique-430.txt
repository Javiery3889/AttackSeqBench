To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
1. **Malware Leveraging AutoIt Downloader**: This indicates the initial stage where the malware is delivered and executed.
2. **Reconnaissance Capabilities**: The malware gathers system information, which is a common first step in an attack to understand the target environment.
3. **Server Deeming the Target Interesting**: This suggests that the gathered information was valuable enough to warrant further action.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:

**A: T1600-Weaken Encryption**
- This technique involves weakening encryption to gain access to encrypted data. While it could be a subsequent step, it doesn't directly follow the reconnaissance phase.

**B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
- This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. While it could be a step after reconnaissance, it doesn't directly follow the initial gathering of system information.

**C: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**
- This technique involves the creation of a Golden Ticket or Silver Ticket to gain unauthorized access to network resources. This is a significant step after reconnaissance, but it is more about gaining access rather than directly following the initial gathering of information.

**D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
- This technique involves the use of remote access software to establish a persistent backdoor or maintain access to the target system. This is a logical step after reconnaissance, as the attacker would want to maintain access to the system they deemed interesting.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Reconnaissance (Gathering System Information)**: This is the first step, which is not directly covered by any of the choices.
2. **Deeming the Target Interesting**: This suggests that the attacker has gathered enough information to proceed.
3. **Maintaining Access**: The next logical step would be to ensure the attacker can continue to access the system, which is best represented by the use of remote access software.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the scenario, is the use of remote access software to maintain access to the target system.

**Final Answer: D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
