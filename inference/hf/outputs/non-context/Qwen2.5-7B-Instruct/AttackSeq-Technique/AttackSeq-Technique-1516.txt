To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Trojan.APT.Seinup used Google Docs to evade callback detection through redirection and encrypted communications via SSL during its malicious communications.**
   - This indicates that the malware used a sophisticated method to communicate with its command and control (C2) server, likely to avoid detection by security systems.

2. **Identify the relevant ATT&CK techniques:**
   - **T1102.003-One-Way Communication:** This technique involves establishing a one-way communication channel, which does not align with the use of Google Docs for two-way communication.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection, which could be part of the SSL encryption mentioned but does not directly describe the use of Google Docs.
   - **T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:** This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication, which could be a plausible method for using Google Docs as a communication channel.
   - **T1036-Masquerading:** This technique involves disguising the malware to blend in with legitimate software, which does not directly relate to the communication method described.

3. **Evaluate the answer choices:**
   - **A: T1102.003-One-Way Communication** does not fit the context of using Google Docs for two-way communication.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding** is a plausible technique but does not directly describe the use of Google Docs.
   - **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols** aligns well with the use of Google Docs for communication, as it involves a publish/subscribe model which can be used for two-way communication.
   - **D: T1036-Masquerading** is not relevant to the communication method described.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the use of Google Docs for communication is T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols.

Final Answer: C
