To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and each answer choice in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - The initial TTP involves using `CertUtil.exe` disguised as `GoogleUpdate.exe` to evade detection. This is a form of fileless malware or a technique to bypass antivirus software by using a legitimate system utility in a malicious manner.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While this can help evade network-based detection, it does not directly address the issue of maintaining persistence through repeated executions of the payload.
   - **B: T1505.003-Web Shell**
     - This technique involves using a web shell to maintain access to a system. While it can be used for persistence, it is more about providing a backdoor for remote access rather than directly addressing the repeated execution of a payload.
   - **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run the payload at regular intervals. This directly addresses the need to maintain persistence by ensuring the payload is executed repeatedly.
   - **D: T1583.007-Serverless**
     - This technique involves using serverless computing to execute code. While it can be used for maintaining persistence, it is less common and more complex compared to scheduled tasks, which are more straightforward and widely used.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial TTP (using `CertUtil.exe` as `GoogleUpdate.exe`) is a method to evade detection.
   - To maintain persistence, the attacker needs a mechanism to ensure the payload is executed repeatedly.
   - Among the given options, T1053-Scheduled Task/Job (C) is the most straightforward and commonly used method to ensure a payload is executed repeatedly, which aligns well with the need to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
