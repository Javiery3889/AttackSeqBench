Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Lazarus group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
   - The context here is the initial access phase of an attack, specifically the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media:** This technique involves spreading malware through removable media like USB drives. It does not fit the context of initial access via spear-phishing emails.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. Spear-phishing is a specific type of phishing, so this fits the context of the initial access via malicious emails.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery:** This technique involves the attacker discovering network configurations to understand the target environment. This is more likely to occur after initial access rather than before.
   - **D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice:** This technique involves using voice-based phishing attacks. The question specifies spear-phishing emails, not voice-based attacks.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question is about the initial access technique used by the Lazarus group, which is spear-phishing emails.
   - T1566-Phishing is the most general term for phishing, and T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice is not relevant as it pertains to voice-based attacks.
   - T1091-Replication Through Removable Media is not related to the initial access via email.
   - T1566-Phishing is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to the use of spear-phishing emails as the initial access technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
