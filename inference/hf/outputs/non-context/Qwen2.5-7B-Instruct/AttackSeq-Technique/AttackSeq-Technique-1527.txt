Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving:
     1. A spear-phishing campaign with macro-embedded documents.
     2. Initial access.
     3. Persistence achieved by dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a legitimate process. It is not directly related to the initial access or persistence steps described in the question.
   - **B: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft**
     - This technique involves stealing or impersonating a token to gain elevated privileges. While it can be a part of post-exploitation activities, it does not directly relate to the initial access or persistence steps.
   - **C: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating processes to find and understand the running processes on a system. It is more relevant to post-exploitation activities, such as identifying and hiding malicious processes, but it does not fit the sequence of initial access and persistence.
   - **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of a process to execute malicious code. It can be used to achieve persistence by ensuring that malicious code runs every time a specific process is executed, such as when a user logs in or a system starts up. This aligns well with the described persistence step of dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the initial access via spear-phishing and persistence via a malicious LNK file, is best described by T1574-Hijack Execution Flow.

Final Answer: D
