Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question mentions that FIN7 gained initial access through a phishing email that used a VBS script to drop and launch a JavaScript backdoor on the victim's machine. This aligns with the T1566.001 technique (Phishing: Email) and T1098 (Account compromise and credentials theft) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Sequence of TTPs**: After gaining initial access, the next step would be to establish a foothold and maintain access. This involves running the dropped backdoor, which is a command and scripting interpreter.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1542.002-Component Firmware**: This technique involves modifying firmware to gain persistence. It is not directly related to the execution of a dropped backdoor.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol that is not the default or expected. This is a step that would occur after the attacker has established a foothold and has data to exfiltrate, which is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute commands or scripts. This directly aligns with the execution of the dropped JavaScript backdoor.
   - **D: T1204.001-Malicious Link**: This technique involves using a malicious link to deliver malware. This is part of the initial access phase, not the next step after the backdoor has been dropped and launched.

4. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access and the execution of the dropped backdoor would be the use of a command and scripting interpreter to maintain and control the compromised system.

Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
