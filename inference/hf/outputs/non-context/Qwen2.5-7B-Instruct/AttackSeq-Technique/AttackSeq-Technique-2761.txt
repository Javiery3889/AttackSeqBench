Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that SOCKSBOT implant used defense evasion methods, specifically reflective loading in memory via svchost.exe, to avoid disk artifacts.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique would logically follow this action.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities. It does not directly follow the evasion technique mentioned.
   - **B: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**
     - This technique involves the use of asymmetric cryptography to secure communications or data. It is not directly related to the evasion technique described.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute commands or scripts. While it is a common technique, it does not directly follow the evasion technique of reflective loading in memory.
   - **D: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**
     - This technique involves wiping disk structures to cover tracks and avoid detection. It directly follows the evasion technique of avoiding disk artifacts by using reflective loading in memory.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attacker uses reflective loading in memory via svchost.exe to avoid leaving disk artifacts.
   - After such an evasion technique, the next logical step would be to ensure that no traces are left on the disk, which is exactly what T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe does.

**Final Answer: D: T1561.002-Disk Structure Wipe**
