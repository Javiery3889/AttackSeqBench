Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file is used to install the main payload.
   - The goal is to avoid triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up, which suggests the malware is trying to execute the payload with elevated privileges without user interaction.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malicious files. It does not directly relate to avoiding UAC prompts.
   - **B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism** - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to bypass UAC or other elevation controls. This could be relevant as it directly addresses avoiding UAC prompts.
   - **C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs** - This technique involves placing a DLL in the AppInit_DLLS registry key to load the DLL into the system's process space. While this can be used to execute code, it does not directly address avoiding UAC prompts.
   - **D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data** - This technique involves purchasing or stealing technical data to facilitate an attack. It is not relevant to the execution of a payload or avoiding UAC prompts.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on avoiding UAC prompts, which is a form of elevation control mechanism.
   - T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is specifically designed to bypass or exploit UAC and other elevation controls, making it the most relevant technique in this context.

**Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
