Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers used a Flash exploit 'show.swf' to trigger a vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119).
   - The payload was then embedded in an image file 'b.gif' for subsequent execution.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1543.001-Launch Agent**:
     - This technique involves the use of a launch agent to execute a payload. However, the question does not mention any launch agent or a mechanism to persist the payload post-exploitation.
   - **B: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion**:
     - This technique is about exploiting a system to evade detection or defense mechanisms. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the embedding and subsequent execution of the payload.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**:
     - This technique involves exploiting a client to execute a payload. The embedding of the payload in 'b.gif' and its subsequent execution aligns well with this technique, as it describes the process of embedding and executing a payload.
   - **D: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools**:
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying tools used by the defender. It does not fit the context of embedding and executing a payload.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with the attack described in the question is T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution, as it directly addresses the embedding and execution of the payload in the 'b.gif' image.

Final Answer: C
