To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the answer choices.

1. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - The Carbanak group used Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network.
   - The next step in the sequence is to identify which ATT&CK technique would logically follow this initial reconnaissance phase.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications. While it could be a part of an attack, it is not directly related to the internal network mapping done by Cobalt Strike.
   - **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. It is not directly related to the internal network mapping done by Cobalt Strike.
   - **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves transferring tools or malware laterally within a network. After mapping the internal network, the next logical step would be to move laterally to other systems within the network.
   - **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
     - This technique involves determining the physical locations of assets. While it could be useful, it is not directly related to the internal network mapping done by Cobalt Strike.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Carbanak group used Cobalt Strike to map the internal network.
   - The next step would be to use the information gathered to move laterally within the network to gain access to other systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after mapping the internal network is to transfer tools or malware laterally within the network.

Final Answer: C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer
