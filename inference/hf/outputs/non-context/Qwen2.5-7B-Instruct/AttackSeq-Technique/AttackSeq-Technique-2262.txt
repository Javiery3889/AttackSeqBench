Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described includes:
     - Executing a batch file.
     - Downloading and running a PowerShell script at the memory level.
     - Achieving persistence through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1566-Phishing (A):** This technique involves using malicious content to entice users to provide sensitive information or to download and execute malicious content. While phishing can be a vector for initial compromise, it does not directly align with the described sequence of executing a batch file and running a PowerShell script at the memory level.
   - **T1205.002-Socket Filters (B):** This technique involves modifying network traffic to evade detection. It does not align with the described sequence of executing a batch file and running a PowerShell script.
   - **T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools (C):** This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to gain an advantage. It could potentially be used to execute a batch file and a PowerShell script, but it does not directly align with the described sequence of running a script at the memory level.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol (D):** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or to establish a command and control channel. It does not align with the described sequence of running a batch file and a PowerShell script.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves a batch file and a PowerShell script being executed, which suggests a direct execution of malicious code.
   - The use of a batch file and PowerShell script at the memory level indicates a technique that allows for quick and stealthy execution without writing to disk, which aligns with the use of in-memory execution techniques.
   - The persistence achieved through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks suggests a technique that ensures the malware remains active even after the system is restarted.

Given the described sequence, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is likely to involve a technique that directly executes malicious code in memory and then ensures persistence through traditional methods like startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

**Final Answer: C: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools** is the most plausible choice, as it can be used to execute the batch file and PowerShell script, and the persistence through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks aligns with the described sequence.
