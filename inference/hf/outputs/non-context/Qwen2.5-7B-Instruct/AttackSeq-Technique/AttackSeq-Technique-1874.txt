Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that the Scote malware used legitimate third-party online services (Pastebin or Google+) to communicate with its C2 servers.
   - The goal is to identify which ATT&CK technique facilitated this communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware is using a legitimate service (Pastebin or Google+) to communicate with its C2 servers.
   - This implies that the malware is leveraging a web service for its communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files** - This technique involves storing credentials in files, which does not align with the communication aspect described.
   - **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - This technique involves obfuscating files or information, which also does not align with the communication aspect.
   - **C: T1001.002-Steganography** - This technique involves hiding information within other files or data, which is not directly related to web service communication.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service** - This technique involves using web services for command and control (C2) communications, which aligns perfectly with the use of Pastebin or Google+ for communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1102-Web Service.

Final Answer: D
