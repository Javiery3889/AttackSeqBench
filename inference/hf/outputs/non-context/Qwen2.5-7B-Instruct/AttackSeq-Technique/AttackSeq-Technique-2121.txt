Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions the use of malicious payloads (SodaMaster) delivered through DESLoader via DLL side-loading.
   - The next step in the sequence is to maintain a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**
     - This technique involves obtaining additional cloud credentials, which is not directly related to maintaining a foothold through scheduled execution of files.
   - **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to run at a specific time or interval. This aligns well with the requirement to execute files every 15 minutes.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While it can be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the need to execute files at regular intervals.
   - **D: T1136-Create Account**
     - This technique involves creating a new account on the target system, which is not directly related to the execution of files at regular intervals.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the requirement to execute legitimate executable files every 15 minutes to maintain a foothold, is T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.

Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
