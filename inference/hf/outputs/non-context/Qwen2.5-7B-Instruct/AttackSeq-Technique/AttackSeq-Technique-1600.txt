Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves FastPOS using keylogging and RAM scraping to steal information.
   - The stolen information is credit card data.
   - The stolen data is then immediately transmitted to the attacker.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK technique under the Collection tactic would most likely follow after the data theft.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery** - This technique involves identifying and listing running processes. It is not directly related to the collection of stolen credit card data.
   - **B: T1115-Clipboard Data** - This technique involves accessing the clipboard to steal data. While it is a form of data collection, it is not directly related to the stolen credit card data being in RAM or having been keylogged.
   - **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores** - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. It is not directly related to the stolen credit card data.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture** - This technique involves capturing user input, which aligns with keylogging. After keylogging, the next step would be to collect the stolen data, which in this case is the credit card information.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - FastPOS uses keylogging and RAM scraping to steal credit card information.
   - Keylogging captures user input, which includes the credit card information.
   - RAM scraping retrieves data that is currently in memory, which would include the stolen credit card information.
   - The next step in the collection tactic would be to gather and use the stolen data.
   - T1056-Input Capture (keylogging) is the technique that captures the user input, and the next logical step would be to collect the stolen data, which is the credit card information.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
