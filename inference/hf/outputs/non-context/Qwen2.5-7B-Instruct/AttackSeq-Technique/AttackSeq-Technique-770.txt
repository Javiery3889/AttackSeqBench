Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with spear phishing lures using malicious RTF documents.
   - The goal is to infect the user with QuasarRAT in the background.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Spear phishing lures with malicious RTF documents are a form of social engineering.
   - The next step is the execution of QuasarRAT, which is a malware that would be used to establish a persistent backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to run a malicious payload. While it could be used to ensure persistence, it is not directly related to the initial infection vector (malicious RTF document).
   - **B: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking** - This technique involves modifying the dynamic linker to load a malicious library. It is not directly related to the initial infection vector (malicious RTF document) and is more about post-infection persistence.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing** - This technique involves using social engineering to trick the user into performing an action that results in the execution of a malicious payload. The use of spear phishing lures with malicious RTF documents fits this description.
   - **D: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain** - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to inject malicious code into legitimate software. It is not directly related to the initial infection vector (malicious RTF document) and is more about a broader attack vector.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step is the use of spear phishing lures with malicious RTF documents.
   - The next step would be the execution of the payload, which in this case is QuasarRAT.
   - The technique that best fits the initial infection vector is T1566-Phishing, as it directly describes the use of social engineering to deliver a malicious payload.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
