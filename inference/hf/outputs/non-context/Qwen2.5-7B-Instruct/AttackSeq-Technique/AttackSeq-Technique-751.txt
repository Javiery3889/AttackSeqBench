To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for enabling stealthy communication with the command-and-control server after the NewPass loader decoded the configuration file and extracted the agent component, let's analyze each answer choice in the context of the attack sequence described.

1. **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves the use of encrypted channels to communicate with the command-and-control server. This is a common method to avoid detection by network monitoring tools and to ensure that the communication remains stealthy. Given that the NewPass loader has already decoded the configuration file and extracted the agent component, using an encrypted channel would be a logical next step to maintain stealth.

2. **T1027.003-Steganography**: This technique involves hiding data within other data, such as images or audio files, to communicate with the command-and-control server. While this can be a stealthy method, it is less likely to be the primary method for establishing a persistent and reliable communication channel after the initial payload has been deployed and the configuration file has been decoded.

3. **T1568.003-DNS Calculation**: This technique involves using DNS queries to exfiltrate data or to establish a connection with the command-and-control server. While DNS can be used for communication, it is more commonly associated with data exfiltration rather than the initial establishment of a stealthy communication channel.

4. **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves the exfiltration of data over a command-and-control channel. While this is a critical part of the attack lifecycle, it is more focused on the exfiltration of data rather than the initial establishment of a stealthy communication channel.

Given the context of the attack sequence, the most plausible TTP for enabling stealthy communication with the command-and-control server after the NewPass loader has decoded the configuration file and extracted the agent component is the use of an encrypted channel.

**Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
