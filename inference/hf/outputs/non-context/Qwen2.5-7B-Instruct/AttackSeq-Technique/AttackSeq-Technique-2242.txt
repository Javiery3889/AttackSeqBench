To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Spear-Phishing Campaigns**: The question mentions that the actor used spear-phishing campaigns with links to RAR-compressed executables and malicious Microsoft Word attachments. This is a common initial attack vector where the adversary tricks the victim into clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment.

2. **Delivery of NetTraveler Trojan**: After the spear-phishing campaign, the NetTraveler Trojan was delivered. This suggests that the spear-phishing was successful in delivering the payload.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**: This technique involves the attacker using dynamic DNS (DDNS) to resolve domain names at runtime. While this could be a technique used to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data, it is not directly related to the spear-phishing and payload delivery sequence described.

B. **T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**: This technique involves the attacker using a cloud service to revert a cloud instance to a previous state. This is not directly related to the spear-phishing and payload delivery sequence described.

C. **T1078.001-Default Accounts**: This technique involves the attacker using default accounts to gain access to a system. While this could be a technique used post-infection, it is not directly related to the spear-phishing and payload delivery sequence described.

D. **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves the attacker using phishing to deliver malware. Given that the question describes a spear-phishing campaign that successfully delivered the NetTraveler Trojan, this technique aligns perfectly with the sequence of events.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The attack sequence starts with a spear-phishing campaign.
2. The spear-phishing campaign successfully delivers the NetTraveler Trojan.
3. The most relevant technique that describes the delivery of malware through a phishing campaign is T1566-Phishing.

**Final Answer: D**
