To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and each answer choice step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already moved laterally across the infrastructure.
   - They have compromised numerous workstations.
   - They are targeting internal hosts and servers.
   - They are searching for critical information.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**
     - This technique involves blocking indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While this could be a tactic used after finding critical information, it doesn't directly align with the search for critical information.
   - **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, which could include databases, file shares, or other data stores. This aligns well with the search for critical information.
   - **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
     - This technique involves obtaining credentials from the operating system, which could be used to gain access to critical information. While this is a common technique, it is more about gaining access rather than the search for information.
   - **D: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing**
     - This technique involves spoofing DHCP to redirect traffic or gain access to the network. While this could be a lateral movement technique, it doesn't directly align with the search for critical information.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers have already compromised workstations and are moving laterally.
   - The next step would logically be to find and access the critical information they are searching for.
   - Among the options, T1213-Data from Information Repositories (B) is the most relevant as it directly pertains to the search for and access to critical information.

**Final Answer: B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
