To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Question Analysis**: The sequence involves:
   - Gathering information on network and host configurations.
   - Employing WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - Targeting user accounts within the victim network.

2. **Identify the Key TTP**: The key TTP here is the one that supports the effort to target user accounts. This implies the need to gather information about user accounts, which is a form of reconnaissance.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:
   - **A: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**: This technique involves discovering trust relationships between domains, which is more about understanding the network topology rather than directly targeting user accounts.
   - **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**: This technique involves modifying authentication mechanisms, which is not directly related to gathering information about user accounts.
   - **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves accessing data from network shared drives, which could be a method to gather information but is not specifically targeted at user accounts.
   - **D: T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves identifying valid user accounts and their associated information, which directly supports the effort to target user accounts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The question specifies that the next step after gathering network and host configurations is to target user accounts.
   - T1087-Account Discovery is the most direct and relevant technique for identifying and gathering information about user accounts, which aligns with the next step in the sequence.

5. **Final Answer**:
   Final Answer: D: T1087-Account Discovery
