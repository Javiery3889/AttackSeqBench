Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves the use of obfuscated JavaScript injection to evade detection and maintain server persistence.
   - The next step is the communication between the Pupy backdoor and the command and control (C2) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question is asking for the technique that facilitated the communication between the Pupy backdoor and the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols:** This technique involves using file transfer protocols to exfiltrate or upload data. It does not directly relate to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.
   - **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:** This technique involves compromising a third-party system to deliver malicious content. It does not directly relate to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using application layer protocols to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence. It is a plausible choice as it directly relates to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.
   - **D: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking:** This technique involves modifying dynamic link libraries to execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the communication between the Pupy backdoor and the C2 server.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol (C) is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the use of application layer protocols for communication, which is a common method for backdoors to communicate with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
