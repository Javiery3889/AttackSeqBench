Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a dropper uses an XOR cipher and a base64 encoded string as the key to extract its modules.
   - The wiper module then overwrites the MBR, partitions, and files on the system using the RawDisk driver.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot:** This technique involves shutting down or rebooting a system to avoid detection or to facilitate the execution of malicious code. However, it does not directly relate to the encryption or extraction of modules.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection or to maintain persistence. The XOR cipher and base64 encoding described in the question align closely with this technique.
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using a command or scripting interpreter to execute malicious code. While this could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to the encryption or extraction process.
   - **T1090.004-Domain Fronting:** This technique involves using domain fronting to hide the true destination of network traffic. It is not relevant to the described encryption and extraction process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1132-Data Encoding:** This technique directly aligns with the XOR cipher and base64 encoding used to extract the modules. It is the most relevant to the described TTPs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs before the wiper module overwrites the MBR, partitions, and files on the system using the RawDisk driver is T1132-Data Encoding.

Final Answer: B: T1132-Data Encoding
