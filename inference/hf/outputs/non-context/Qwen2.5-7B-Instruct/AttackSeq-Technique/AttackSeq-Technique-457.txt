Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The rootkit gathers browsing data.
   - It then establishes communication with its hard-coded C&C domains to download the homepage configuration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The rootkit is gathering data (data collection).
   - It then communicates with a C&C server to download additional configuration (communication with command and control).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**
     - This technique is not related to the communication with C&C servers or data collection from browsing activities. It is more about managing customer relationships, which is irrelevant here.
   - **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
     - This technique is about controlling traffic flow, which is not relevant to the rootkit's communication with C&C servers or data collection.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to establish and maintain a connection with a remote server. This aligns well with the rootkit communicating with its C&C domains.
   - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a user's system through a malicious website. While it could be part of the initial infection vector, it does not directly address the communication with C&C servers or data collection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly addresses the communication with the C&C server.

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
