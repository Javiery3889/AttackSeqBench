Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where sensitive information is collected from an iOS device.
   - The information is then sent out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key TTPs here are the encoding of the data and the use of a random prefix to obfuscate the data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1614-System Location Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering and exfiltrating location data from a system. While it might be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the encoding and obfuscation of the data.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique specifically involves encoding data to evade detection or analysis. Base64 encoding is a common method of data encoding, and the use of a random prefix is a form of obfuscation, which aligns well with this technique.
   - **C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**
     - This technique involves using a front domain to hide the true destination of network traffic. It is not directly related to the encoding of data.
   - **D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
     - This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to gain an advantage. It does not relate to the encoding or obfuscation of data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question focuses on the encoding and obfuscation of data.
   - T1132-Data Encoding directly addresses the encoding of data.
   - The use of Base64 encoding and a random prefix is a form of data obfuscation, which is covered by T1132.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B
