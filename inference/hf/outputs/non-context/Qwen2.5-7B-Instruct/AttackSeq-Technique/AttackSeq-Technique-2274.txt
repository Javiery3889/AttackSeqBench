To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the attack sequence described, let's break down the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Execution of Encrypted Virtual File System (EVFS) Containers**: This suggests that the attackers are using a custom file system to manage their payloads, which is a sophisticated method to hide and manage malware.

2. **Stealing Credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings**: This indicates that the attackers are interested in obtaining sensitive information from a specific application, in this case, Internet Explorer.

Given the sequence, we need to find a TTP that logically follows the execution of EVFS containers and precedes the credential theft from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.

### Analysis of Each Answer Choice:

- **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves identifying files and directories on a system. While it is a common TTP, it does not directly follow the execution of EVFS containers nor does it precede the credential theft from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.

- **B: T1564.005-Hidden File System**: This technique involves using a hidden file system to store data or malware. This is closely related to the execution of EVFS containers, as both involve hidden storage mechanisms. However, it does not directly precede the credential theft.

- **C: T1218.011-Rundll32**: This technique involves using the Rundll32.exe utility to execute code. Rundll32 is often used to execute malicious payloads or to perform actions that require administrative privileges. This could be a plausible step after the execution of EVFS containers and before stealing credentials, as it could be used to run the credential-stealing module.

- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts of the attack to avoid detection. While it is a common TTP, it is more of a general approach rather than a specific step that would logically follow the execution of EVFS containers and precede the credential theft.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Execution of EVFS Containers**: This is the initial step where the attackers use a custom file system to manage their payloads.
2. **Rundll32 (T1218.011)**: This is a logical step where the attackers use Rundll32 to execute the credential-stealing module, which would then steal credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.

### Conclusion:

The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the execution of EVFS containers, the attackers would use Rundll32 to execute the credential-stealing module.

Final Answer: C
