Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - Ensuring the integrity of the malicious payload using a sha256 checksum.
     - Bypassing detection with an encrypted shellcode.
     - Loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1610-Deploy Container**:
     - This technique involves using containers to host and run malicious code. It does not directly relate to loading a DLL and executing a payload.
   - **B: T1106-Native API**:
     - This technique involves using native Windows APIs to perform actions that are not easily detected by security software. This could be relevant for loading a DLL and executing a payload, as it would involve using Windows APIs to load and execute the DLL.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**:
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server. It does not directly relate to loading a DLL and executing a payload.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**:
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts of the attack to avoid detection. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly relate to loading a DLL and executing a payload.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the payload is first verified for integrity, then bypassed using encryption, and finally, a DLL is loaded and executed.
   - The technique that best fits the action of loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload is T1106-Native API, as it involves using native Windows APIs to perform actions that are not easily detected by security software, which aligns with the described sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1106-Native API**
