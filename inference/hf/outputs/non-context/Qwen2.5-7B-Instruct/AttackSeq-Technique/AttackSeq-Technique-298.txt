To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Distribution and Installation**: The question mentions the use of a mobile configuration profile to distribute and install the custom iOS surveillanceware Phenakite. This step is not directly related to the answer choices provided, as they focus on post-exploitation techniques.

2. **Command and Control (C2)**: The question states that Arid Viper achieved command and control by utilizing a misconfigured Firebase server for exfiltration of collected data. This indicates that the attackers are using a web service (Firebase) to establish a C2 channel.

3. **Identifying the Correct TTP**: We need to find the TTP that aligns with the use of a misconfigured Firebase server for exfiltration. Let's evaluate each answer choice:

   - **A: T1589.001-Credentials**: This technique involves the use of stolen credentials, which is not directly related to the use of a Firebase server for exfiltration.
   - **B: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: This technique involves executing code based on an event, which is not directly related to the use of a Firebase server for exfiltration.
   - **C: T1098.006-Additional Container Cluster Roles**: This technique involves additional roles in container cluster management, which is not directly related to the use of a Firebase server for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves the use of a web service for C2, which aligns with the use of a misconfigured Firebase server for exfiltration.

Given the analysis, the most plausible TTP that aligns with the use of a misconfigured Firebase server for exfiltration is T1102-Web Service.

**Final Answer: D**
