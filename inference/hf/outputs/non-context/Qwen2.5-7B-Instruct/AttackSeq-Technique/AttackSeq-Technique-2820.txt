To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Derusbi malware gathered host and system information**: This indicates the initial reconnaissance phase.
2. **Communication traffic to the C2 using obfuscated HTTP POST requests**: This suggests that the malware has established a command and control (C2) channel and is using obfuscation to avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to evade detection. While this could be a part of the malware's behavior, it does not directly relate to the communication phase described in the question.

B. **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves the use of alternative communication channels in case the primary channel is detected or blocked. This could be relevant if the malware needs to establish a fallback in case the primary C2 channel is compromised, but it doesn't directly fit the sequence described.

C. **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves the malware disguising its network traffic to blend in with legitimate traffic. While this could be part of the obfuscation process, it is more about the appearance of the traffic rather than the actual communication phase.

D. **T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves the use of obfuscation to hide the data being transmitted. This directly aligns with the description of the malware using obfuscated HTTP POST requests for communication.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP that occurs after gathering host and system information and before the obfuscated HTTP POST requests is the obfuscation of the data being transmitted.

**Final Answer: D**
