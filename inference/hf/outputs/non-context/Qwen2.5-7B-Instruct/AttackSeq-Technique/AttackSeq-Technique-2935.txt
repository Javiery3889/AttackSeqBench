To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Spear-phishing emails were used to deliver malicious payloads.**
   - This indicates the initial vector for the attack, which is a social engineering technique.

2. **GHOLE malware employed a .DLL file with misleading export function names to bypass detection.**
   - This is a technique to hide the malicious functionality of the malware, making it harder to detect and analyze.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1037-Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts**
   - This technique involves using scripts that run during the boot process or logon sequence to execute malicious code. While it can be a method to hide or persist malware, it does not directly relate to the use of a .DLL file with misleading export function names.

B. **T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
   - This technique involves using cloud storage or services to transfer data or malware. It does not align with the use of a .DLL file with misleading export function names.

C. **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
   - This technique involves transferring tools or malware into a target environment, often through social engineering or other means. It is more about the initial transfer of the malicious payload, which aligns with the spear-phishing emails mentioned in the question.

D. **T1564-Hide Artifacts**
   - This technique involves hiding or obfuscating the presence of malicious artifacts, such as files, processes, or network connections. The use of a .DLL file with misleading export function names is a method to hide the malicious functionality, which aligns well with this technique.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible sequence is that the spear-phishing emails delivered the malicious payload, and then the malware used a .DLL file with misleading export function names to hide its malicious functionality.

**Final Answer: D**
