Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca conducted reconnaissance using tools like PowerSploit.
   - **Discovery:** They discovered machines in the same domain.
   - **Execution:** They executed malicious code through the creation of a fake system update service.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using malicious content to entice users to provide sensitive information or to install malware. It does not align with the sequence of creating a fake system update service.
   - **B: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**
     - This technique involves removing indicators of compromise from tools used in the attack. It does not fit the sequence as it occurs after the attack has been detected or tools have been deployed.
   - **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying external remote services to establish a foothold. This aligns well with the creation of a fake system update service, which is a method to establish a remote service.
   - **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
     - This technique involves encoding or encrypting data to make it harder to understand. While it can be used in the context of the attack, it does not directly align with the creation of a fake system update service.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack described is the creation of a fake system update service, which is directly related to the technique of creating or modifying external remote services.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
