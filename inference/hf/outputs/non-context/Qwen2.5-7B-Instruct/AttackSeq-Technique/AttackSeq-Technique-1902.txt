To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Executing the coin miner**: This indicates that the attackers have already gained a foothold and are executing malicious code on the host.

2. **TeamTNT's script using iplogger.org**: This suggests that the attackers are tracking the number of infected hosts and obtaining their details, which implies reconnaissance and possibly lateral movement.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

A. **T1542.004-ROMMONkit**: This technique involves the use of a ROMMON (Read Only Memory Monitor) backdoor. While it could be a method to gain initial access, it does not directly relate to the tracking and reconnaissance activities mentioned in the question.

B. **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker discovering network connections and services on the target system. This could be a step before using iplogger.org to track infected hosts, as it would help the attackers understand the network topology and identify potential targets.

C. **T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves the attacker actively scanning the network to discover hosts and services. This could also be a step before using iplogger.org, as it would help the attackers identify and track infected hosts.

D. **T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves the attacker discovering valid accounts on the target system. While this could be a step in the attack chain, it does not directly relate to the tracking and reconnaissance activities mentioned in the question.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be to first understand the network environment and the hosts involved. Therefore, the most relevant technique would be one that helps the attackers discover and track the network connections and hosts.

**Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
