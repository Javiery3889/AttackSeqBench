Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions reconnaissance activities using system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK technique enabled the Lazarus Group to gain initial access to the pharmaceutical company's network through targeted communication channels.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial reconnaissance using system utilities (`ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`) is a form of network scanning and information gathering.
   - The next step is gaining initial access through targeted communication channels.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration, which aligns with the reconnaissance using `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`.
     - However, it does not directly address the method of gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice-based phishing to gain access. It fits the description of gaining initial access through targeted communication channels.
   - **C: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
     - This technique involves compromising cloud accounts, which is not directly related to the initial access through targeted communication channels.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain access, which also fits the description of gaining initial access through targeted communication channels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The reconnaissance activities using `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` are part of the initial information gathering phase.
   - The next step, gaining initial access through targeted communication channels, is best described by either T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice or T1566-Phishing.
   - Between the two, T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice is more specific to voice-based phishing, which is a targeted method of communication.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Final Answer: B
