Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is:
     1. Execution of a dropper ("BlackEnergy dropper").
     2. Execution of "vba_macro.exe" using a macro-enabled Word document.
     3. Building and running strings in memory.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves persisting malware to run at boot or logon. It does not align with the sequence of executing a dropper and then running strings in memory.
   - **B: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media to exfiltrate or move data. It does not align with the sequence of executing a dropper and running strings in memory.
   - **C: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into an image file (e.g., a Word document) to execute when the file is opened. This aligns with the execution of "vba_macro.exe" using a macro-enabled Word document.
   - **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using protocols other than HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, or ICMP for C2. It does not align with the sequence of executing a dropper and running strings in memory.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the execution of a dropper, followed by the execution of a macro in a Word document, and then running strings in memory.
   - T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection (C) is the most relevant technique as it describes the execution of code (in this case, "vba_macro.exe") through a macro-enabled document.
   - The other techniques do not fit the described sequence.

**Final Answer: C**
