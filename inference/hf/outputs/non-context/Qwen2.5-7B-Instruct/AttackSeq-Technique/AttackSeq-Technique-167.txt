Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that include:
     - Defense evasion (redirecting victims to legitimate services and using domain shortening services).
     - Accessing credentials through phishing pages that impersonate login portals.
   - The goal is to identify which ATT&CK technique best fits the scenario of accessing credentials through such phishing pages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1003.004-LSA Secrets:** This technique involves accessing local security authority (LSA) secrets, which is not directly related to phishing or credential access through impersonated login portals.
   - **B: T1090-Proxy:** This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is more about traffic manipulation and not directly related to credential access through phishing.
   - **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities:** This technique involves developing capabilities to support the adversary's objectives, which is too broad and not specific to the scenario of credential access through phishing.
   - **D: T1056-Input Capture:** This technique involves capturing user input, which can be used to capture credentials entered into a phishing page. Phishing pages are designed to mimic legitimate login portals and trick users into entering their credentials, which is a form of input capture.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where victims are tricked into entering their credentials into a phishing page that mimics a legitimate login portal. This is a classic example of input capture, where the adversary is capturing user input (credentials) through a malicious page.
   - Among the given options, T1056-Input Capture (D) is the most relevant and directly aligns with the described scenario of accessing credentials through phishing pages.

**Final Answer: D**
