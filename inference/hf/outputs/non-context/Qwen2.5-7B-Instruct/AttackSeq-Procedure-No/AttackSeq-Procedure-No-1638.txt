Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     1. Discovery phase using PsLogList to identify privileged users.
     2. Encryption of data using the 3DES algorithm with a hardcoded key.
     3. Exfiltration of the encrypted data.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - PsLogList is a tool used to list process tokens, which can help identify privileged users. This is a common TTP in the discovery phase.
     - Encrypting data with 3DES and a hardcoded key is a specific method of data encryption. However, 3DES is considered outdated and less secure compared to modern encryption standards like AES. Additionally, using a hardcoded key is a risky practice as it can be reverse-engineered.
     - Exfiltrating encrypted data is a common TTP in the data collection phase.
     - While the sequence described is plausible, it is not the most common or sophisticated approach in modern cyberattacks.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely.
     - While the use of PsLogList for discovery is common, the combination of 3DES encryption with a hardcoded key is not a typical or recommended practice in modern cybersecurity. Modern attackers often use more secure encryption methods and avoid hardcoded keys to reduce the risk of detection and reverse-engineering.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs. While the described sequence is technically possible, it is not the most plausible or sophisticated approach. Modern attackers are more likely to use more secure encryption methods and avoid hardcoded keys to reduce the risk of detection and reverse-engineering.

**Final Answer: B**
