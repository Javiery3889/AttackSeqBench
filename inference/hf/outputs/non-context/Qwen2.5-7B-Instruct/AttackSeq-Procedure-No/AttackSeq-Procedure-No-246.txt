To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the context provided by the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the known tactics of HIDDEN COBRA (also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, or Sofacy).

1. **Intercepting Customer Transaction Data**: This indicates a data exfiltration attempt, which is a common tactic used by APTs to steal sensitive information.

2. **Malicious Scripts Injected into Store Checkout Pages**: This is a specific method of delivering malware or malicious code to target systems, often categorized under the "Persistence" and "Exfiltration" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **MIME Protocol for Exfiltration**: The MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) protocol is typically used for sending and receiving email attachments and can be used to encode and transmit binary data over email. However, it is not a common method for exfiltrating data in the context of web-based attacks or for APTs like HIDDEN COBRA.

HIDDEN COBRA is known for using more sophisticated and stealthy methods for data exfiltration, such as leveraging legitimate protocols like HTTPS, DNS tunneling, or even custom protocols that mimic normal traffic to avoid detection. MIME is not typically part of their known TTPs.

Given this analysis, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
