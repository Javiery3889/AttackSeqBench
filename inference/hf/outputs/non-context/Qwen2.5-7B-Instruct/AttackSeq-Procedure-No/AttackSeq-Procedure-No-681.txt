Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access.
   - The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the adversaries will detect the compromised Docker APIs only after deploying malicious containers.
     - This implies that the adversaries are not aware of the compromised Docker APIs until they deploy the containers, which is unlikely because the initial access already indicates that the Docker API is compromised.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the adversaries would detect the compromised Docker APIs during reconnaissance.
     - Given that the Docker API is misconfigured and exposed to the internet, it is reasonable to assume that tools like DOCKERGEDDON, which are designed to scan for misconfigured Docker APIs, would detect the compromised API during reconnaissance.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The misconfiguration of the Docker API and its exposure to the internet make it a known vulnerability.
   - Tools like DOCKERGEDDON are specifically designed to identify such misconfigurations.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that the adversaries would detect the compromised Docker API during reconnaissance rather than only after deploying malicious containers.

**Final Answer: No**
