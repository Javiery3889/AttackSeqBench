To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Spear Phishing Document**: The attack starts with a spear phishing document, which is a targeted email designed to trick a specific individual into opening it.

2. **Exploitation of CVE-2012-0158**: The spear phishing document exploits a specific vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to execute malicious code.

3. **Dropping Malicious Components**: After the exploit, the attack drops malicious components such as `wab.exe` and `wab32res.dll`. These are likely to be payloads designed to perform further actions on the compromised system.

4. **Targeting ASEAN Region**: The question asks if the attack targets the ASEAN region. This implies that the attack is geographically focused on countries within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

5. **Decoy Document**: The attack uses a decoy document that is suspected to be stolen for reconnaissance purposes. This suggests that the attackers are gathering information about the target before or during the attack.

6. **Reconnaissance Only Afterwards**: The question specifies that the reconnaissance is only done afterwards, implying that the primary goal of the attack is not reconnaissance but rather to deploy the malicious components and possibly perform other actions.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the attack does target the ASEAN region and uses a decoy document for reconnaissance. However, the question does not provide enough information to confirm that the primary goal is reconnaissance. The primary goal seems to be the deployment of malicious components.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the attack does not target the ASEAN region or does not use a decoy document for reconnaissance. Given the information provided, this seems to be a more plausible sequence of TTPs because the primary goal appears to be the deployment of malicious components rather than reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: B**
