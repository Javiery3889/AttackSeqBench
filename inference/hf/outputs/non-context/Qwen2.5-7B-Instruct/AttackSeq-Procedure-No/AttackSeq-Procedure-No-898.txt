To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Exfiltration of Data**: The question mentions that data was exfiltrated from the victim network using the SmartFTP Client during the Collection phase. This is a common TTP where attackers use legitimate tools to move data out of the network.

2. **Impact Phase**: The question then asks about the likelihood of a DDoS attack occurring during the Impact phase. The Impact phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework is when the attacker attempts to cause harm to the victim's systems or data.

3. **Deployment of RYUK Ransomware**: The question also mentions that RYUK ransomware was deployed a week later. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's data and demands a ransom for the decryption key.

4. **Sequence Evaluation**:
   - **DDoS Attack**: A DDoS attack is a method to disrupt the victim's network services by overwhelming them with traffic. This can be a way to cause immediate harm and disruption.
   - **RYUK Ransomware**: Deploying ransomware is a more common and direct method to extort money from the victim. It is typically done after the attacker has gained access and has the ability to encrypt data.

Given the options:
- **A: Yes** - This suggests that a DDoS attack is more likely to occur during the Impact phase than deploying RYUK ransomware a week later.
- **B: No** - This suggests that deploying RYUK ransomware a week later is more likely than a DDoS attack during the Impact phase.

**Reasoning**:
- The Impact phase is typically when the attacker seeks to cause harm or disruption. While a DDoS attack can cause immediate harm, ransomware is often deployed to extort money, which is a more common and direct method of causing long-term damage.
- Deploying ransomware a week later aligns with the typical ransomware attack lifecycle, where the attacker first gains access, collects data, and then deploys ransomware to encrypt the data and demand a ransom.

**Conclusion**:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the attack sequence described, is that deploying RYUK ransomware a week later is more likely than a DDoS attack during the Impact phase.

Final Answer: B
