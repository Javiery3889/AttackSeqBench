To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Reconnaissance Activities**: The question mentions that the attack starts with reconnaissance activities, which include gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the target environment.

2. **Malicious Implants**: The question specifies that the attack uses malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3. BlackEnergy 3 is known for its use in various cyber-attacks, particularly in the context of the Ukraine power grid attacks. It is a malware that can be used to perform a variety of actions, including data exfiltration, command and control (C2) communication, and lateral movement.

3. **Execution of Payloads**: The question then asks about the use of Ruby scripts to execute payloads after the implants are installed. BlackEnergy 3 is known to use various methods for payload delivery, including but not limited to, the use of malicious macros in Microsoft Office documents. However, there is no widely documented evidence of BlackEnergy 3 using Ruby scripts for payload execution.

4. **Employee-Enabled Macro Execution**: The question also mentions that the implants are installed through employee-enabled macro execution. This is a common method used by many malware families to exploit user behavior and gain initial access to a network.

Given this analysis, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that Ruby scripts are used to execute payloads after the implants are installed. As discussed, there is no documented evidence of BlackEnergy 3 using Ruby scripts for this purpose. Therefore, this answer is not plausible.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that Ruby scripts are not used to execute payloads after the implants are installed. Given the lack of evidence for BlackEnergy 3 using Ruby scripts in this context, this answer is more plausible.

**Final Answer: B**
