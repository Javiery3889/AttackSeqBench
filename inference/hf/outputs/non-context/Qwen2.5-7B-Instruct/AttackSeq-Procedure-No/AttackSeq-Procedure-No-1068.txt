To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - **Yellow Garuda** is a known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The group uses a tool called the Telegram 'grabber' to collect various types of data from victims' Telegram accounts, including messages, media, group memberships, and contact data.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks if the collected data is likely to be divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that the data is indeed divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that the data is not divided into fixed-size chunks and is exfiltrated in a more straightforward manner.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Data Size and Evasion:** APT groups often use sophisticated methods to evade detection, including splitting data into smaller chunks to avoid triggering alerts or detection mechanisms that monitor for large data transfers.
   - **Exfiltration Techniques:** Dividing data into smaller chunks can help in bypassing network monitoring and security systems that are designed to detect large data exfiltration attempts.
   - **Historical Behavior:** Based on known APT tactics, it is common for groups like Yellow Garuda to employ such techniques to remain undetected.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context of APT groups and their known tactics, it is highly plausible that Yellow Garuda would use techniques to divide the collected data into fixed-size chunks to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
