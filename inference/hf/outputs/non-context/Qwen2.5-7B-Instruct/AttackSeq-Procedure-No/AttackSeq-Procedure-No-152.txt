Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **TG1021** used **SharpHound** and **PowerSploit** to perform reconnaissance and gather output files during the Discovery phase.
   - SharpHound is a tool used for gathering information from Active Directory, and PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell-based penetration testing and exploitation modules.
   - The reconnaissance phase involves gathering information about the network and systems to identify potential targets.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **SharpHound** and **PowerSploit** are used for reconnaissance.
   - The output files from this reconnaissance are gathered.

3. **Evaluate the Lateral Movement Phase:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.
   - AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) is a service that provides Single Sign-On (SSO) and Single Logout (SLO) capabilities.
   - SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) tokens are used for authentication and authorization in SSO scenarios.

4. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that using a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement is a plausible TTP.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that using a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement is not a plausible TTP.

5. **Reasoning:**
   - After gathering information through SharpHound and PowerSploit, the next logical step in an attack would be to move laterally within the network to other systems.
   - Compromising an AD FS server and using its SAML tokens for authentication can provide a way to move laterally without being detected by traditional authentication mechanisms.
   - This is a sophisticated and stealthy method that aligns with advanced persistent threat (APT) actors' tactics.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context of the attack and the sophistication of the actors (TG1021), it is plausible that they would use such a method for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
