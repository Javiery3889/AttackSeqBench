To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The attack sequence involves the Collection tactic, where files are compressed using zlib.
   - The question then asks about a potential Exfiltration tactic, specifically whether Vyveva (a hypothetical or known threat actor) would divide files if their size is 0x1000000 bytes or more.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that Vyveva would indeed divide files if their size exceeds 0x1000000 bytes during the Exfiltration tactic.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that Vyveva would not divide files if their size exceeds 0x1000000 bytes during the Exfiltration tactic.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question does not provide specific information about Vyveva's behavior regarding file division during Exfiltration. However, the context of the question implies that the compression (zlib) and file size threshold (0x1000000 bytes) are part of a strategy to manage the size of the data being exfiltrated.
   - File division is a common tactic used to avoid detection and data loss during exfiltration, especially when dealing with large files. If a file exceeds a certain size, it might be divided into smaller chunks to be exfiltrated more easily and to avoid triggering alerts or data loss prevention mechanisms.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is plausible that Vyveva would divide files if their size exceeds 0x1000000 bytes as part of the Exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
