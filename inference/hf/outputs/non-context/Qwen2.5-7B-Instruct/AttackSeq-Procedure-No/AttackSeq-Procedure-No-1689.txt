Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack is described as using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations.
   - It involves sending a PDF attachment that passed through security filters and appeared benign.
   - The goal is to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the scenario described. Using legitimate tools and scripts can help evade detection because they are not flagged as malicious by security systems.
     - Sending a PDF attachment that passes through security filters and appears benign is a common tactic to bypass security measures and deliver malicious payloads.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the scenario described. If the attack did not use legitimate tools and scripts, or if the PDF did not pass through security filters and appeared benign, it would not align with the described evasion tactics.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes an attack that uses legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection.
   - It also mentions a PDF attachment that passes through security filters and appears benign, which is a common tactic to bypass security measures.
   - Both of these tactics are consistent with the goal of evading detection.

**Final Answer: Yes**
