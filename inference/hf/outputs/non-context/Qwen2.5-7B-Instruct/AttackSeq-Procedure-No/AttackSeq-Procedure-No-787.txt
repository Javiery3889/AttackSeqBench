To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **APT Group**: Higaisa APT group.
2. **Malicious File**: LNK file disguised as a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results.
3. **Delivery Method**: Spear-phishing.
4. **Execution**: JavaScript file.
5. **Actions**:
   - Creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe'.
   - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
   - Sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
- The sequence includes:
  1. Spear-phishing to deliver a malicious LNK file.
  2. Execution of a JavaScript file.
  3. Actions such as creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.
- This sequence aligns with typical APT group behavior, where they use spear-phishing to deliver a payload, which then executes additional malware and performs exfiltration or persistence actions.

**B: No**
- This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible.
- Given the detailed and specific nature of the TTPs mentioned, it is unlikely that the question is suggesting an implausible sequence.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **APT Group Behavior**: Higaisa APT groups are known for using sophisticated spear-phishing techniques to deliver malware.
2. **Malicious File**: LNK files can be used to execute payloads when double-clicked, making them a plausible vector for delivering malware.
3. **JavaScript Execution**: JavaScript can be used to perform various actions, including downloading and executing other malware.
4. **Persistence and Exfiltration**: Creating and executing a new executable ('d3reEW.exe') and copying another executable ('svchhast.exe') to the startup directory are common persistence mechanisms. Sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL is a typical method for exfiltrating data or communicating with the attacker's command and control server.

### Conclusion:
The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the known behavior of APT groups, particularly Higaisa. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
