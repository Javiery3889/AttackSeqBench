Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The callCam app collects extensive information from compromised devices.
   - **Collection Phase:** The app is likely to facilitate ARP cache poisoning.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The data is sent to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - ARP cache poisoning is a technique used to redirect network traffic by poisoning the ARP cache of a router or switch. This can be used to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
     - After collecting information, it is plausible that the app would use ARP cache poisoning to ensure that the data is sent to the C&C server without being intercepted by other devices on the network.
     - The use of a customized encoding routine in the exfiltration phase suggests that the data is being obfuscated to avoid detection, which is a common practice in advanced persistent threats (APTs).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the app does not facilitate ARP cache poisoning, it would mean that the data is sent in the clear or through a less stealthy method, which could be more easily detected and intercepted.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The callCam app is collecting sensitive information, which suggests a need for stealth and control over the data flow.
   - ARP cache poisoning is a sophisticated method to ensure that the data is not intercepted during transmission.
   - The use of a customized encoding routine further indicates a need to avoid detection and ensure the data's integrity and confidentiality.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the need for stealth and control over the data flow, it is more plausible that the app would facilitate ARP cache poisoning to ensure the data is sent to the C&C server without being intercepted.

Final Answer: A
