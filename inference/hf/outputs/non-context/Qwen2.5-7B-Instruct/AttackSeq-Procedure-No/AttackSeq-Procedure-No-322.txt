Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The app collects various types of data (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) from an iOS device.
   - The app performs routines on the iOS device.
   - The question asks if the app is likely to use encryption for its C2 (Command and Control) channel before uploading files via FTP protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the app uses encryption for its C2 channel. While it's not uncommon for malware to use encrypted C2 channels to avoid detection, the question does not provide any specific information that would indicate the app is sophisticated enough to use encryption.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the app does not use encryption for its C2 channel. Given that the app is performing routines and collecting sensitive data, it is more plausible that the app would use a simple and direct method for communication, such as FTP, without encryption, to avoid complicating the process and to ensure the data is easily accessible.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The app is described as performing routines and collecting sensitive data from an iOS device. This behavior is typical of a less sophisticated piece of malware.
   - Using FTP for data transfer is a straightforward method that does not require additional steps for encryption, which could complicate the malware's operation.
   - There is no indication in the question that the app is sophisticated enough to use encryption for its C2 channel.

**Final Answer: B: No**
