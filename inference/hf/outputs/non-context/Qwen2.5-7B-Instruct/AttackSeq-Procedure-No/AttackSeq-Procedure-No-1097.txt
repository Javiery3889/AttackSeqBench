To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Exfiltration via FTP**: The question mentions that CosmicDuke has already exfiltrated data to remote servers using FTP. This is a known TTP for CosmicDuke.
2. **Keylogger, Screenshotter, Clipboard Stealer**: These are tools that can be used to gather additional information from the compromised system.
3. **Searching Removable Drives**: This indicates that CosmicDuke is looking for additional data on external storage devices.
4. **Skipping Certain File Types**: This suggests that CosmicDuke has a specific set of file types it is interested in and will avoid others.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:
- **A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will use keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers after exfiltrating data via FTP, and will search removable drives while skipping certain file types.
  - This sequence aligns with typical behavior of advanced persistent threats (APTs) like CosmicDuke, which often use a variety of methods to gather as much information as possible from a compromised system.

- **B: No**
  - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke will not use keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers after exfiltrating data via FTP, and will not search removable drives while skipping certain file types.
  - This does not align with the typical behavior of CosmicDuke, as it is known to use a variety of methods to gather information.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Exfiltration via FTP**: This is a known TTP for CosmicDuke.
2. **Keylogger, Screenshotter, Clipboard Stealer**: These tools are commonly used by APTs to gather additional information.
3. **Searching Removable Drives**: This is a common tactic for APTs to find additional data.
4. **Skipping Certain File Types**: This is a known tactic to focus on specific data of interest.

### Conclusion:
The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of CosmicDuke. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers after exfiltrating data via FTP, and searching removable drives while skipping certain file types.

**Final Answer: A**
