Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware exfiltrates data using a HTTP GET request.
   - The malware then establishes communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS.
   - The malware uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after exfiltrating data via HTTP GET, the malware will establish HTTPS communication and use a custom data encoding algorithm.
     - This sequence of TTPs is plausible because:
       - HTTP GET is a common method for exfiltrating data.
       - HTTPS is often used for secure communication with C2 servers to avoid detection.
       - Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation is a common technique to evade detection by security systems.

   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not establish HTTPS communication or use a custom data encoding algorithm after exfiltrating data via HTTP GET.
     - This sequence of TTPs is less plausible because:
       - HTTPS is a standard and effective method for secure communication, and it is unlikely that malware would avoid it.
       - Custom data encoding is a common technique used by malware to obfuscate data and evade detection, so it is unlikely that malware would not use it.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Choice A.

Final Answer: A
