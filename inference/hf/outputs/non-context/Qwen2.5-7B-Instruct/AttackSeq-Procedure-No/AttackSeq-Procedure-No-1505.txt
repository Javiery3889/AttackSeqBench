Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by RIG EK, a known exploit kit.
   - The first TTP mentioned is the use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm to establish an encrypted channel for command and control operations.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that proxy servers will be used within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Using proxy servers can indeed help in making infections harder to detect. Proxies can mask the true origin of the traffic, making it more difficult for defenders to trace the attack back to the attacker.
     - Proxies can also be used to bypass network security measures and can help in evading detection by security systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that RIG EK does not use proxy servers, which is less likely given the common practice in advanced persistent threats (APTs) and exploit kits to use proxies to hide their activities and evade detection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - RIG EK, as an exploit kit, is likely to employ various techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - Using a custom encryption algorithm (RC4) for command and control communications is a sophisticated method to avoid detection by security systems.
   - To further enhance their operations and make infections harder to detect, it is highly plausible that RIG EK would also use proxy servers to mask their traffic and evade network security measures.
   - Therefore, the use of proxy servers is a common and effective tactic in such scenarios.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
