Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the attackers gained initial access through opportunistic phishing emails. This is a common method for initial compromise.

2. **Creating Backdoors**: After gaining access, the attackers created backdoors on the compromised systems. This is a standard practice to maintain persistence and control over the compromised systems.

3. **AppleScript to Inject Malicious JavaScript**: The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers used AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser. AppleScript is a scripting language for macOS that can automate tasks. While it is possible to use AppleScript to automate tasks, it is not a common method for injecting malicious JavaScript into a browser. Typically, such actions would be performed using more direct methods like exploiting browser vulnerabilities or using browser extensions.

4. **Executing Malicious Payloads**: The question mentions that the attackers executed malicious payloads, including the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool. This is a plausible step after gaining control and establishing persistence.

5. **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the attackers used AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser. Given the typical methods used for such attacks, this seems less likely.
   - **B: No**: This choice suggests that the attackers did not use AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser. This is more plausible given the common methods used in such attacks.

**Final Answer: B**
