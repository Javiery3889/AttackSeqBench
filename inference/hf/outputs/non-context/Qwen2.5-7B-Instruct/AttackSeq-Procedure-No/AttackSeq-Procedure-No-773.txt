Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Tortoiseshell gains initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from hiremilitaryheroes[.]com.
   - **Persistence:** The RAT named 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service.
   - **Malware Downloader:** The malware downloader executes binaries.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after gaining initial access, the next steps are to install and execute the 'IvizTech' RAT as a service to maintain persistence, followed by the execution of a malware downloader.
     - This sequence aligns with common cyber attack patterns where initial access is used to establish a foothold, maintain persistence, and then deploy additional malware.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the 'IvizTech' RAT is not installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence after the initial access.
     - This would imply a different sequence of TTPs, which does not align with the typical attack pattern described in the question.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (initial access, then installing and executing a RAT as a service for persistence, followed by the execution of a malware downloader) is a plausible and common sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
