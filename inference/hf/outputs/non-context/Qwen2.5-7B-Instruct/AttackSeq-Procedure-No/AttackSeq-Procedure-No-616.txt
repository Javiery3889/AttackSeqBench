To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Hidden Cobra Group's Initial TTP**: The group used domains impersonating cryptocurrency platforms to host Bankshot implants. This is a common tactic to trick users into downloading malware by making the malicious domain appear legitimate.

2. **Next TTP in the Sequence**: The question asks if it is likely that the group would use valid account information such as VPN credentials to remotely access victim networks before executing the Bankshot implant through a Flash exploit.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that after the initial domain impersonation, the group would use valid account information to gain remote access to the victim's network. This is a plausible step because once the group has gained access to the network, they can better position themselves to deploy the Bankshot implant through a Flash exploit. Valid credentials would allow them to move laterally within the network and ensure the implant is placed in a location where it can be effectively used.

**B: No**
- This choice suggests that the group would not use valid account information to remotely access the victim's network. This is less plausible because using valid credentials would provide the group with a more secure and stealthy method of accessing the network, which is often a preferred method for advanced threat actors.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial TTP**: Domain impersonation to host Bankshot implants.
2. **Logical Next Step**: Gaining remote access to the victim's network using valid account information (e.g., VPN credentials) to ensure a secure and stealthy entry point.
3. **Final TTP**: Executing the Bankshot implant through a Flash exploit.

Given the logical progression and the nature of advanced threat actors, using valid account information to gain remote access is a common and effective tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
