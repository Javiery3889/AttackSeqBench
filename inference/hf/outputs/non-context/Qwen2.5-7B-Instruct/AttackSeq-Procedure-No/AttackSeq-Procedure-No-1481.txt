Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Seaduke: A technique used to hide behind multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation to evade defenses.
   - Retrieving system information: Gathering data about the target system.
   - Securely deleting itself: Ensuring that traces of the attack are removed.
   - Mimikatz PowerShell: A tool used to extract credentials from memory.
   - Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks: A method to gain access to network resources using stolen tickets.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This sequence of TTPs is plausible and follows a logical order:
       1. Seaduke is used to evade detection.
       2. System information is retrieved to understand the target environment.
       3. The malware or attacker ensures that it leaves no trace by securely deleting itself.
       4. Mimikatz PowerShell is used to extract credentials.
       5. Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks are conducted to gain further access.
     - This sequence aligns with typical advanced persistent threat (APT) behavior, where attackers first establish a foothold, gather intelligence, and then use various techniques to maintain access and escalate privileges.

   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible. However, the sequence described in the question is a common and logical sequence of actions for an APT group like the Duke group.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and logical sequence of TTPs for an APT group.

**Final Answer: A**
