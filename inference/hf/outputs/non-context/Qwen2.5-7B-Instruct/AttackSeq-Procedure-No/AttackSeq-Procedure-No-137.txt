Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders only, posting download links to the Slack channel, and then building CAB files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will indeed follow the described sequence of actions: creating archive files of Desktop folders, posting download links to a Slack channel, and then building CAB files.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - Creating archive files of Desktop folders is a common method for data exfiltration as it targets sensitive files that users frequently access.
       - Posting download links to a Slack channel is a method to distribute the files to the attackers, which is a common tactic in cyber attacks.
       - Building CAB files (a type of archive file) is a method to package the data for exfiltration, which is also a common practice.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not follow the described sequence of actions.
     - This is less plausible because the described sequence of actions is a logical and effective method for data exfiltration, and there is no information provided that would suggest the attackers would not follow such a method.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The SLUB backdoor's behavior of downloading a 'gist' snippet and parsing it for commands is a common method for attackers to gain control and execute further actions.
   - Creating archive files of Desktop folders is a practical and effective method for exfiltrating data.
   - Posting download links to a Slack channel is a method to distribute the files to the attackers, which is a common tactic.
   - Building CAB files is a method to package the data for exfiltration, which is also a common practice.
   - Given the plausibility and effectiveness of the described sequence, the most likely scenario is that the attackers will follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A**
