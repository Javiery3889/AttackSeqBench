To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Evasion Techniques**: The question mentions that the APT group evades defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows and using fileless loading techniques. This indicates a sophisticated approach to avoid detection.

2. **Communication Protocols**: The question specifies that the group likely used HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server. HTTP is a common protocol for web traffic, and TCP is a reliable transport protocol often used for establishing connections. This combination is plausible for evading certain types of network monitoring and security measures.

3. **Backdoor Usage**: The question states that the Aria-body backdoor was used to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase. This suggests that once the initial communication is established, the backdoor is used to perform more specific and targeted actions.

4. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence described in the question is:
   - Evasion (limited time windows, fileless loading)
   - Communication (HTTP and TCP)
   - Backdoor usage (Aria-body for process discovery)

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that the group first evades detection, then uses common protocols for communication, and finally deploys a backdoor to gather specific information.

- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible, which contradicts the information provided.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
