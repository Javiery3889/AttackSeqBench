To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the components and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **SideCopy**: This is a technique or tool used in cyber attacks, often associated with lateral movement and data exfiltration. It is known for copying data from one system to another, often in a covert manner.

2. **Exfiltration over Google Drive**: This refers to the method of data exfiltration where the stolen data is uploaded to a Google Drive account. This is a common method used by attackers to avoid detection by network security measures.

3. **GoLang-based file recon plugins**: This indicates the use of a specific programming language (GoLang) to perform file reconnaissance. The purpose is to identify and gather information about files that might contain sensitive data, such as authentication databases.

4. **Exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases**: Kavach is a security solution, and its authentication databases are likely to contain sensitive information. The exfiltration of such databases would be a significant part of the attack.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. SideCopy would first copy the data, then use GoLang-based file recon plugins to identify the Kavach authentication databases, and finally exfiltrate the data over Google Drive.

- **B: No**: This would imply that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible. However, there is no clear reason provided in the question why this sequence would be implausible.

Given the logical flow of the attack sequence, where data is first copied, then identified, and finally exfiltrated, the sequence described in the question appears to be a plausible and common method used by attackers.

**Final Answer: A**
