Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Mustang Panda, a known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
- The first TTP mentioned is the use of documents that attempt to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses.
- The second TTP in question is the use of the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) in a spearphishing campaign.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Mustang Panda is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection, including the use of spearphishing campaigns.
- The double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) is a technique where a file with a .doc extension is actually a .lnk (Windows shortcut) file, which can be used to execute malicious payloads when opened.
- This technique is designed to bypass security measures that may block .exe files but not .doc files, as .doc files are often considered less suspicious.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Mustang Panda is known for its use of advanced and evasive tactics in spearphishing campaigns.
- The use of the double extension trick is a well-documented technique used by APT groups to bypass security measures and deliver payloads.
- Given that Mustang Panda is known for its sophisticated and evasive tactics, it is highly plausible that they would use the double extension trick in their campaigns to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
