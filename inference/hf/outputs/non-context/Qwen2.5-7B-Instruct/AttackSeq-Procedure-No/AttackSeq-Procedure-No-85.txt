To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Compressing Files with zlib for Transmission to C&C Server:**
   - This step is mentioned in the question but is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs involving the collection of system information and files.

2. **Collecting System Information:**
   - The question states that the backdoor will collect system information such as the computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and the local IP address.

3. **Collecting Files:**
   - The question also mentions that the backdoor will collect files from the computer after obtaining the system information.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

**A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that the backdoor will indeed collect system information and then proceed to collect files. This aligns with the sequence described in the question.

**B: No**
- This choice suggests that the backdoor will not collect system information before collecting files, which contradicts the sequence described in the question.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question specifies that the backdoor will collect system information first.
2. After collecting the system information, the backdoor will then proceed to collect files.
3. Answer choice A aligns with this sequence, while answer choice B does not.

**Final Answer: A**
