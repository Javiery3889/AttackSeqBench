Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - Uploading exfiltrated data to a C&C server using the HTTP protocol.
   - Collecting device information such as GPS location.
   - Ensuring persistence by auto-starting at device boot through listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.

2. **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the app follows the sequence of actions as described in the question.
     - It implies that the app first uploads exfiltrated data, then collects device information, and finally ensures persistence.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the app does not follow the sequence of actions as described in the question.
     - It implies that the app does not collect device information or ensure persistence in the manner described.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question is a plausible sequence for a malicious app. Many malware and spyware apps follow a similar pattern:
     1. Exfiltrate data to a C&C server to maintain communication with the attacker.
     2. Collect additional information about the device to understand its environment and capabilities.
     3. Ensure persistence to maintain control over the device even after a reboot.
   - The `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver is a common method for ensuring persistence in Android malware.

Given the plausible nature of the sequence described in the question and the common practices of malicious apps, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is as described in Choice A.

**Final Answer: Yes**
