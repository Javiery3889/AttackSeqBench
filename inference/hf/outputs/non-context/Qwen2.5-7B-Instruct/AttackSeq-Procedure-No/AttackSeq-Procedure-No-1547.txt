To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Overwriting the Infected RTF File**: This step is mentioned to evade detection.
2. **Establishing Persistence**: The malware (Smoaler) is likely to use `rundll32.exe` to ensure it runs automatically upon system reboot or user logon.
3. **Executing the Embedded Payload**: The payload is written to the `%TEMP%` folder and then executed.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:

**Answer Choice A: Yes**
- **Overwriting the Infected RTF File**: This step is correctly described.
- **Establishing Persistence**: Using `rundll32.exe` to ensure automatic re-loading upon system reboot or user logon is a common persistence mechanism.
- **Executing the Embedded Payload**: Writing the payload to the `%TEMP%` folder and running it is a plausible method for ensuring the payload is executed.

**Answer Choice B: No**
- This choice would imply that Smoaler does not use `rundll32.exe` for persistence or does not write the payload to the `%TEMP%` folder and run it. However, the question does not provide any information that contradicts these steps.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Overwriting the Infected RTF File**: This is a common technique to evade detection.
2. **Persistence Mechanism**: Using `rundll32.exe` is a well-known method for establishing persistence.
3. **Payload Execution**: Writing the payload to the `%TEMP%` folder and running it is a typical approach to ensure the payload is executed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the plausible actions of Smoaler.

**Final Answer: A**
