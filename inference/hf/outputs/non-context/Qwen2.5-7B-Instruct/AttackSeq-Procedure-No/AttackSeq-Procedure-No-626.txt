Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign used protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish communication with C2 servers.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the SombRAT backdoor will use HTTPS or SMTPS for data exfiltration, but not through the C2 protocol.
     - Given that the CostaRicto Campaign already established communication with C2 servers using DNS and HTTP, it is less likely that the SombRAT backdoor would use a non-C2 protocol for data exfiltration, as this would deviate from the established communication method.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the SombRAT backdoor will not use HTTPS or SMTPS for data exfiltration, but will continue to use the C2 protocol.
     - This is more plausible because the SombRAT backdoor is likely to maintain consistency with the established communication methods used by the CostaRicto Campaign.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign used DNS and HTTP for communication with C2 servers.
   - It is more likely that the SombRAT backdoor would continue to use the same protocols (HTTPS or SMTPS) for data exfiltration, as it would maintain consistency with the established communication methods.
   - Using a non-C2 protocol for data exfiltration would be less likely and could indicate a deviation from the established tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the CostaRicto Campaign.

**Final Answer: B: No**
