To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the answer choices.

1. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - The FHAPPI campaign delivered an APT phishing email.
   - The email contained a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - The VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file, leading to its execution.

2. **TTP Sequence:**
   - The sequence involves initial access via a phishing email, followed by the execution of a VBScript, and then the execution of a .doc file.

3. **Answer Choices Evaluation:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that the malware will not install itself as a cron job using the cron utility.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The scenario describes a sequence of actions that are typical of a sophisticated APT campaign, which often aims to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - Using a cron job to install malware is a common method for maintaining persistence on a Linux or Unix system, as cron jobs are used to schedule tasks.
   - However, the scenario mentions a .doc file being executed, which is more commonly associated with Windows environments. The use of cron jobs is more typical in Unix-like systems.
   - The use of PowerShell for further execution is also more common in Windows environments, as PowerShell is a powerful scripting language available on Windows systems.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the scenario involves a .doc file being executed, it is less likely that the malware would use a cron job to install itself, as this is more typical in Unix-like systems rather than Windows.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not involve the malware installing itself as a cron job.

**Final Answer: B: No**
