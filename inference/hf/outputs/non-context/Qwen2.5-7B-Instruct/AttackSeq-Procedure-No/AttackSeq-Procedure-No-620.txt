Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural) used by the lightSpy malware.
   - The malware first collects data, including hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data.
   - The question then asks if the malware is likely to use DNS Calculation as a method to determine the command and control (C2) port for module updates and data exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware uses a specific method (DNS Calculation) to determine the C2 port.
     - DNS Calculation involves using the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine the port number.
     - This method is not a common or well-known technique in the context of malware operations, especially for lightSpy, which is known for its use of more straightforward and less complex methods.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware does not use DNS Calculation for determining the C2 port.
     - Given the nature of lightSpy and the described TTPs, it is more plausible that the malware uses simpler and more direct methods for C2 communication, such as hardcoded IP addresses or domain names.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that are typical for lightSpy, including data collection from various sources.
   - The DNS Calculation method described in the question is not a common or well-documented technique used by lightSpy or other similar malware.
   - LightSpy is known for its use of more straightforward methods for C2 communication, such as hardcoded IP addresses or domain names.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that lightSpy would use DNS Calculation for determining the C2 port.

**Final Answer: B**
