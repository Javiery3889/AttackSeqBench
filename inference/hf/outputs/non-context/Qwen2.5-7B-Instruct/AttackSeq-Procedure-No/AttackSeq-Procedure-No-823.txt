To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The question mentions that TG-3279 performs reconnaissance using open source research and network scanning. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.

2. **Gaining Initial Access**: The question states that TG-3279 will use tools such as 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploiting targets. 's' is likely a typo and should be 'nmap' (a popular network scanning tool), and 'rdp_crk' is a tool used for brute-forcing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials. This is also a common method for gaining initial access to a network.

3. **Compromising Infrastructure**: The question then mentions that TG-3279 will compromise infrastructure by cloning domain registration information from legitimate companies like Google or Microsoft. This is a more advanced and specific step that involves social engineering or other sophisticated techniques to gain further access or control over the network.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. It aligns with a typical cyber attack sequence where reconnaissance is followed by gaining initial access, and then further compromising infrastructure through more advanced techniques.

- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs described is not plausible. However, the sequence described in the question is a common and plausible sequence of TTPs in many cyber attacks.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed likely to be followed by TG-3279.

Final Answer: A
