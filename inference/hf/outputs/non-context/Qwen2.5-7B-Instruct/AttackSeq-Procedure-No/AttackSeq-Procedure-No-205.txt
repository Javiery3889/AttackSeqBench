To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Attack Sequence in the Question:**
   - Retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.
   - Moving to the Windows temp folder.
   - Creating shortcut files in the startup folder to maintain persistence.

2. **Analysis of Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the described sequence of actions is likely to occur.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that the described sequence of actions is unlikely to occur.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Retrieving C&C Configuration:** BLACKGEAR is known for using social media for C&C communication, which aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Moving to Temp Folder:** Malware often uses temporary folders to avoid detection and to facilitate quick execution.
   - **Creating Startup Shortcuts:** Creating shortcuts in the startup folder is a common method for maintaining persistence, ensuring the malware runs every time the system starts.

Given the known tactics of malware like BLACKGEAR, the described sequence of actions is consistent with their known methods and TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
