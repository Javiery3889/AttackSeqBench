Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Initial TTP:**
   - The question mentions exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems. This is a known vulnerability in PHPUnit that was exploited by the Tuyul malware.

2. **Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described is:
     1. Exploit CVE-2017-9841.
     2. Download a bash script named 'cron'.
     3. Execute Perl scripts.
     4. Execute shell commands.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is not plausible.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Exploiting CVE-2017-9841:** This is a known TTP used by the Tuyul malware to gain initial access.
   - **Downloading a bash script named 'cron':** This is a plausible method for maintaining persistence. The 'cron' script could be used to schedule tasks, which is a common technique for malware to ensure it remains active.
   - **Executing Perl scripts and shell commands:** These are also common TTPs used by malware to perform various actions on the compromised system, such as data exfiltration, command and control communication, or further exploitation.

Given that the Tuyul malware is known to use these techniques, the sequence described in the question is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
