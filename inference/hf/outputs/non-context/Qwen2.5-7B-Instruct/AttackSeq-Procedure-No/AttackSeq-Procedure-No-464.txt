To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Initial TTPs Mentioned:**
   - Capturing user credentials using a keylogger module.
   - Performing OS credential dumping with known LOLBIN (Living Off the Land Binary) techniques.

2. **Subsequent TTPs to Evaluate:**
   - Using legitimate utilities such as AnyDesk and PuTTY for maintaining remote access to victim environments.

3. **Analysis of Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the PowerLess Backdoor (a hypothetical or known malware) would use legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTY to maintain persistence and remote access. This is a common tactic in malware to blend in with normal system operations and avoid detection.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the PowerLess Backdoor would not use legitimate utilities for maintaining remote access. This would imply that the malware would use more overt or less common methods, which is less likely given the effectiveness of using well-known and trusted utilities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of legitimate utilities like AnyDesk and PuTTY is a common tactic in malware to maintain persistence and remote access. These utilities are widely used and trusted, making it harder for defenders to detect their misuse.
   - The PowerLess Backdoor, if it is designed to be stealthy and maintain long-term access, would likely leverage such trusted tools to avoid raising suspicion.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common practice of using legitimate utilities to maintain remote access, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the PowerLess Backdoor would indeed use AnyDesk and PuTTY for this purpose.

Final Answer: A
