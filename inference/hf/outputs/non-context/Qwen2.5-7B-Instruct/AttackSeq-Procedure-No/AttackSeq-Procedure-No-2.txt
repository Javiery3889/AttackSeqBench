Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys.
   - The malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - The malware queries the registry for installed applications as part of software discovery.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after achieving persistence and defense evasion, the malware will query the registry for installed applications. This is a logical next step for the malware to understand the environment and identify potential targets or competing software.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not query the registry for installed applications. This would be less likely given the context of the other TTPs, as understanding the environment is crucial for the malware's operations.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The malware has already established persistence and evaded detection by impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable. These actions are aimed at ensuring the malware remains undetected and continues to operate.
   - Querying the registry for installed applications is a common technique for malware to gather information about the system, identify potential targets, or determine if it is running in a sandbox or virtual environment.
   - This step aligns with the typical behavior of malware that has already taken steps to establish itself and evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
