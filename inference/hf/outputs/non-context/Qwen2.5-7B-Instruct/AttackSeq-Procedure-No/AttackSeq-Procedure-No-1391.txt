To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Identify the TTPs in the Question:**
   - Dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
   - Gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

2. **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Yes**
   - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely to be used by FIN13.
   - FIN13 is known for using various TTPs, including credential dumping and reconnaissance. Dumping LSASS memory is a common method used by APTs to obtain credentials, and using native OS binaries for reconnaissance is also a typical approach.

3. **Evaluate Answer Choice B: No**
   - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely to be used by FIN13.
   - Given FIN13's known tactics, this choice would imply that they do not use these specific methods, which contradicts their known behavior.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - FIN13 is a known APT group that has been observed using a variety of TTPs, including credential dumping and reconnaissance.
   - Dumping LSASS memory is a well-documented method used by APTs to obtain credentials, and it aligns with FIN13's known tactics.
   - Gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries is also a common practice for APTs, and FIN13 has been observed using similar methods.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with FIN13's known behavior and tactics.

Final Answer: Yes
