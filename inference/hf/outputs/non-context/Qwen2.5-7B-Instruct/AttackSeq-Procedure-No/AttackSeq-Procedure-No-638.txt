Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by a PIVY variant:
1. Evading defenses using DLL sideloading.
2. Modifying the configuration of the dropped DLL to confuse tools parsing configuration data.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - PIVY variants are known for their sophisticated evasion techniques, including the use of DGA for C2 communications. DGA is a common tactic used by malware to generate a large number of potential domain names for C2 servers, making it difficult for defenders to block or predict the communication channels.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not use DGA for C2 communications. However, given the sophistication of PIVY and the described evasion techniques, it is less likely that the malware would forego a DGA for C2 communications, as this would provide an additional layer of stealth and resilience.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a PIVY variant that is already using sophisticated evasion techniques such as DLL sideloading and modifying configuration data to confuse detection tools.
- PIVY variants are known to use DGA for C2 communications to evade detection and maintain persistence.
- The described evasion techniques suggest a high level of sophistication, and DGA is a common and effective method for further evading detection and maintaining communication with the C2 server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
