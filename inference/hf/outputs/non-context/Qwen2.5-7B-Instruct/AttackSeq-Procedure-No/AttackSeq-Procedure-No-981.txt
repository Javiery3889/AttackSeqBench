To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step.

1. **Gathering Credentials**: The question mentions the use of tools like ChromePass and Lazagne for credential access. These tools are typically used to extract credentials from browsers and other applications, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.

2. **Focus on File and Print Servers**: The question then asks if Buckeye (presumably a threat actor or group) is likely to focus on file and print servers to steal documents only after gathering credentials.

3. **Stealing Documents**: The question specifies that the focus is on stealing documents, which implies a specific intent to exfiltrate sensitive information.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after gathering credentials, the threat actor (Buckeye) would indeed focus on file and print servers to steal documents. This aligns with the typical behavior of many threat actors who gather credentials to gain access to systems and then use that access to steal valuable data.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that after gathering credentials, the threat actor would not focus on file and print servers to steal documents. This would imply a different sequence of TTPs, possibly involving other types of targets or objectives.

Given the typical behavior of threat actors who gather credentials to gain access to systems and then use that access to steal valuable data, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actor would indeed focus on file and print servers to steal documents.

**Final Answer: A**
