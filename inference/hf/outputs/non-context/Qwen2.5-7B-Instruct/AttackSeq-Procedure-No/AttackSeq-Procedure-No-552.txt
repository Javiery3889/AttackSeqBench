Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving a skip-2.0 backdoor, hooks in the sqllang.dll service, blocking event logging, and then using a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD to backdoor a service principal with ApplicationImpersonation rights to start collecting emails from targeted mailboxes.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible. The skip-2.0 backdoor and the use of hooks in the sqllang.dll service are sophisticated techniques often used by advanced threat actors to maintain persistence and stealth. Blocking event logging is a common tactic to evade detection. Using a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD to backdoor a service principal with ApplicationImpersonation rights is a highly targeted and effective method to gain access to sensitive information, such as emails from targeted mailboxes.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible. However, the techniques described are all within the realm of advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics and are often used in conjunction with each other to achieve the desired objectives.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The skip-2.0 backdoor and hooks in the sqllang.dll service are sophisticated methods to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - Blocking event logging is a common tactic to evade security monitoring and analysis.
   - Compromising a global administrator account in Azure AD and using ApplicationImpersonation rights to backdoor a service principal is a highly targeted and effective method to gain access to sensitive information, such as emails from targeted mailboxes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the techniques described and their common use in advanced cyber-attacks, the sequence of TTPs is plausible.

Final Answer: A
