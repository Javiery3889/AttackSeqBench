Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - Sending diplomatic-themed phishing emails with a PDF attachment.
   - The PDF attachment links to ENVYSCOUT.
   - Planting a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.
   - Utilizing HTML Smuggling via ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
   - Employing obfuscation techniques.

2. **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and likely to be followed by the adversary.
     - Let's break down the plausibility:
       - **Phishing Emails with Diplomatic-Themed PDFs:** This is a common tactic used by adversaries to increase the likelihood of the target opening the email and clicking on the attachment.
       - **Linking to ENVYSCOUT:** ENVYSCOUT is a known malware that can be used to deliver other payloads. This step is plausible as it allows the adversary to bypass certain security measures.
       - **Planting a Legitimate Binary that Loads a Malicious DLL:** This is a sophisticated technique where a legitimate binary is used to load a malicious DLL, which can help evade detection and achieve persistence.
       - **HTML Smuggling via ENVYSCOUT Delivery Scripts:** This technique involves using HTML to smuggle malicious content, which can be used to deliver the payload. ENVYSCOUT is known to use such techniques.
       - **Employing Obfuscation Techniques:** Obfuscation is a common practice to make the malware harder to detect and analyze. This step is plausible and often used in advanced persistent threats (APTs).

   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible or likely to be followed by the adversary.
     - Given the detailed and sophisticated nature of the TTPs described, it is unlikely that the sequence would be deemed implausible.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with known advanced cyber-attack techniques and the use of ENVYSCOUT malware.

**Final Answer: A**
