Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:** Adversaries identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:** Adversaries use functions like DOCKERGEDDON to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after identifying domains resolving to the same IP address, adversaries would then use DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase.
     - The Resource Development phase involves identifying and using shared IP addresses, which is a method to establish a foothold or gather intelligence on the target network.
     - The Reconnaissance phase involves gathering information about the target network, including scanning for vulnerabilities and services.
     - Using DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase to scan netblocks for compromised Docker APIs is a plausible next step after establishing shared IP addresses, as it helps in identifying potential entry points or services that could be exploited.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that after identifying domains resolving to the same IP address, adversaries would not use DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase.
     - This would imply a disjointed sequence of TTPs, where the use of shared IP addresses does not logically lead to scanning netblocks for Docker APIs during the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern.
   - Establishing a foothold by using shared IP addresses (Resource Development) is a precursor to more detailed reconnaissance (Reconnaissance).
   - Scanning netblocks for compromised Docker APIs (DOCKERGEDDON) is a natural progression in the Reconnaissance phase to identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer: A**
