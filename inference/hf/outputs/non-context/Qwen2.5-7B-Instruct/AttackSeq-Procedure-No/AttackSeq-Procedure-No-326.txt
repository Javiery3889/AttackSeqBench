Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving an XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.
   - The app hides its icon and runs in the background.
   - The question then asks if the app is likely to use `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` to identify Domain Administrators for discovery.
   - After identifying the Domain Administrators, the app is expected to send the gathered information, including processes data, via HTTP to a C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs:**
   - **T1027 - Discovery:** The use of `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` is a technique to discover Domain Administrators, which falls under the Discovery tactic (T1027).
   - **T1071.001 - Application Layer Protocol - HTTP:** Sending data via HTTP to a C2 server is a common technique for exfiltration and communication with the attacker, which falls under the Application Layer Protocol (T1071.001).

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the app is likely to use the `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` command and then send the gathered information via HTTP to a C2 server.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that the app is unlikely to use the `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` command and/or is unlikely to send the gathered information via HTTP to a C2 server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` is a plausible technique for an attacker to identify Domain Administrators, which is a common step in reconnaissance and privilege escalation.
   - Sending the gathered information via HTTP to a C2 server is also a common method for exfiltrating data and maintaining communication with the attacker.

Given the plausibility of both steps in the attack sequence, the most likely scenario is that the app would indeed use these techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
