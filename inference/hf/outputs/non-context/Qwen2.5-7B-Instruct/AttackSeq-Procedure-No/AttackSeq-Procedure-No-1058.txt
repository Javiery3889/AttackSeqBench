To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions an obfuscated batch script that executes `myScript.ps1`.
   - The final TTP in question is the communication method used for command and control (C2).

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the final PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`) will lead to communication using Telnet for C2 instead of njRAT.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the final PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`) will not lead to communication using Telnet for C2, but rather will use njRAT.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question does not provide any specific information about the C2 communication method used by `myScript.ps1` or any other scripts or malware involved.
   - The use of Telnet for C2 is a less sophisticated method compared to njRAT, which is a more advanced and stealthy malware.
   - Without additional context or evidence, it is less likely that a sophisticated malware like njRAT would switch to a less secure and more easily detected method like Telnet for C2.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the lack of specific information and the nature of njRAT, it is less plausible that `myScript.ps1` would switch to Telnet for C2.

**Final Answer: B: No**
