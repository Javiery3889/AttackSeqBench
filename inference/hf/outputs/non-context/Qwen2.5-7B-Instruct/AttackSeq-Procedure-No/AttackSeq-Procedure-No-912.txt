To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the steps and the behavior of Gamaredon, a known APT group.

1. **Backdoor Installation**: The question mentions that Gamaredon uses backdoors to gain access to the target system. This is a common initial step in many APT campaigns.

2. **File Listing**: After gaining access, the question states that Gamaredon lists interesting files, such as Office documents. This indicates that they are looking for specific types of files that could contain sensitive information.

3. **Collection of Files**: The next step in the question is the collection of these listed files from various information repositories. This is a logical follow-up to the file listing, as the goal is to gather as much data as possible.

4. **Uploading to C&C Server**: The final step mentioned is the automatic uploading of the harvested documents to the Command and Control (C&C) server. This is a typical behavior for APT groups to exfiltrate data from the compromised system to their servers for further analysis and exploitation.

Given this sequence, we can evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This aligns with the typical behavior of APT groups like Gamaredon. After identifying and collecting files of interest, they would likely upload these files to their C&C server for further analysis and exploitation.
- **B: No** - This would imply that Gamaredon does not follow through with the final step of uploading the collected files, which is less likely given their known methods and objectives.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Backdoor installation is a common initial step.
2. Listing interesting files (e.g., Office documents) is a method to identify potential data of interest.
3. Collecting these files from information repositories is a logical next step.
4. Uploading the collected files to a C&C server is a standard method for APT groups to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
