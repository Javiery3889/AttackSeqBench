To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access via Spearphishing**: The question mentions that the attackers used spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF files to gain initial access. This is a common TTP used by adversaries to deliver malware to a target.

2. **Portable FAT16 Partition Image**: The question then asks about the use of a portable FAT16 partition image placed in the %TEMP% directory as a hidden file system. This is a specific and somewhat unusual TTP. FAT16 is an older file system, and using it as a hidden file system in the %TEMP% directory is not a typical method for establishing persistence or maintaining access.

3. **Hidden File System**: The use of a hidden file system is a method to avoid detection, but the combination of a FAT16 partition image in the %TEMP% directory is not a standard or well-documented TTP in the context of Hacking Team's spyware or other known malware.

4. **Establishing Communication with C&C Servers**: After gaining initial access, the malware typically establishes a connection with the Command and Control (C&C) servers to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data. This is a common TTP, but it is not directly related to the specific method of using a FAT16 partition image.

Given the analysis, the use of a FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system in the %TEMP% directory is not a typical or well-documented TTP for Hacking Team's spyware or other known malware. While the initial access via spearphishing and the establishment of communication with C&C servers are common and plausible, the specific method described in the question is not.

**Final Answer: B**
