Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a malware that uses HTTPS for command and control (C2) operations. It then asks if it is likely that the malware will use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to discover system information and process lists.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to gather system information and process lists. This is a plausible action for malware to understand the environment it is operating in, which can be useful for further exploitation or to tailor its behavior to the specific system.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command. While it is possible that the malware might use other methods to gather information, the use of 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' is a common and effective method for gathering such information, and there is no specific reason given in the question to believe that the malware would avoid this method.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is described as using HTTPS for C2 operations, which indicates a sophisticated approach to maintaining stealth and persistence.
- Gathering system information and process lists is a standard step in the malware lifecycle, as it helps the malware understand the environment it is operating in, which can be crucial for further exploitation or to avoid detection.
- The 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command is a straightforward and effective way to gather this information, and there is no indication in the question that the malware would avoid this method.

Final Answer: A
