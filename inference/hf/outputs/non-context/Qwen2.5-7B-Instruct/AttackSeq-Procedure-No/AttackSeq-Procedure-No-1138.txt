Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural) during the Reconnaissance phase, specifically mentioning the use of social media platforms for long-term monitoring via benign emails and tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will deploy publicly available tools like Mimikatz to obtain credentials during the Credential Access phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:** The use of social media platforms for long-term monitoring via benign emails and tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com is a common tactic used by APTs to gather information about potential targets. This aligns with the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **Credential Access Phase:** Mimikatz is a well-known tool used to extract credentials from memory, which is a common tactic in the Credential Access phase. However, WINDSHIFT APT is known for its use of custom tools and techniques rather than relying on publicly available tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - WINDSHIFT APT is known for its sophisticated and often custom-developed tools and techniques, which are designed to evade detection and maintain stealth.
   - While Mimikatz is a powerful and widely used tool for credential access, WINDSHIFT APT is less likely to use publicly available tools due to the risk of detection and analysis.
   - The question asks if it is "likely" that WINDSHIFT APT will use Mimikatz, and given their known behavior, it is less likely that they would use a publicly available tool like Mimikatz for credential access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the above reasoning, the most plausible answer is that WINDSHIFT APT is less likely to use publicly available tools like Mimikatz for credential access.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "No".

Final Answer: B: No
