To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Compromise with GreyEnergy mini**: The question states that the GreyEnergy group has already compromised a computer using GreyEnergy mini. This is the initial step in the attack sequence.

2. **Lateral Movement**: The next step mentioned in the question is the use of SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools for lateral movement across the compromised network. These tools are commonly used for administrative access and can facilitate moving from one machine to another within a network.

3. **Network Mapping and Credential Collection**: The final steps mentioned are the use of Nmap for network mapping and Mimikatz for collecting credentials. Nmap is a network scanning tool that can be used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, while Mimikatz is a tool used to extract credentials from memory.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. After compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, the group would logically use tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, followed by network mapping and credential collection using Nmap and Mimikatz, respectively.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the sequence described in the question. If the group does not use these tools for lateral movement, network mapping, and credential collection, it would not align with the typical attack sequence involving these TTPs.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs as described in the question is supported by Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
