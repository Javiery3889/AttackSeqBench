To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The question states that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information. This is a common TTP where malware gathers information about the target environment to understand the network topology, system configurations, and other relevant details.

2. **Communication Method**: The question then asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant communicated with the Command and Control (C2) server using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. This part of the question is more specific and requires an evaluation of the likelihood of using blogs and WordPress for C2 communication.

3. **Evaluating the Communication Method**:
   - **Blogs and WordPress**: Typically, blogs and WordPress sites are used for content management and are not designed for secure, bidirectional communication with malware. While it is theoretically possible to use a blog or WordPress site for C2 communication, it would be highly unusual and not a common practice. This method would likely be easily detected and blocked by security measures.
   - **Common C2 Communication Methods**: More common methods for C2 communication include domain generation algorithms (DGAs), encrypted HTTP/HTTPS traffic, and other covert channels that are less likely to be detected by standard network monitoring tools.

4. **Conclusion**: Given the typical methods used for C2 communication and the unusual nature of using a blog or WordPress for such purposes, it is unlikely that the Rising Sun implant would use this method for bidirectional communication.

Final Answer: B: No
