Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already conducted system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.
   - The next step is likely to be credential dumping, which is often done using tools like Mimikatz.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use a PowerShell script speculated to be related to Mimikatz to read the memory of `lsass.exe`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - System fingerprinting and domain trust discovery are initial reconnaissance steps to gather information about the target environment.
     - Credential dumping is a common next step in post-exploitation activities, where attackers seek to gain access to user credentials.
     - Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential dumping, and it can be executed via PowerShell to read the memory of `lsass.exe`, which contains the credentials.
     - The use of a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz is plausible because it can be more stealthy and less likely to trigger alerts compared to direct execution of Mimikatz.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers would not use a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz to read the memory of `lsass.exe`.
     - This is less likely because Mimikatz is a powerful tool for credential dumping, and using a PowerShell script to execute it is a common and effective method.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already gathered initial information about the target environment.
   - The next logical step is to attempt to gain access to user credentials.
   - Mimikatz is a well-known and effective tool for credential dumping.
   - Using a PowerShell script to execute Mimikatz to read the memory of `lsass.exe` is a plausible and common method to achieve this goal.

**Final Answer: A**
