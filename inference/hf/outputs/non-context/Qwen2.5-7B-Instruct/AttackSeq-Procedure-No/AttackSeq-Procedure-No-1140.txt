To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The attacker has deployed the 'Recon' module group to gather initial system information and determine subsequent actions. This is a common first step in many cyber attacks to understand the target environment.

2. **Backdooring Azure AD Pass-Through Authentication**: The attacker then injects a malicious DLL into the AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService to create a backdoor for future access. This step is aimed at maintaining persistence and gaining unauthorized access to the Azure AD environment.

3. **Spreading**: The 'Spreading' module group is then used to infect other hosts on the network. This could be done through various methods, such as exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., MS08-067) or using stolen admin credentials.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the initial reconnaissance and backdooring Azure AD, the attacker would proceed to spread the infection to other hosts. This sequence of TTPs is logical and follows a typical cyber attack lifecycle, where reconnaissance is followed by persistence and then lateral movement/spreading.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attacker would not proceed to spread the infection to other hosts after backdooring Azure AD. This is less likely because once the attacker has established a backdoor, the next logical step would be to spread the infection to other hosts to maximize the impact and maintain control over the network.

Given the logical progression of TTPs in a cyber attack, the most plausible sequence is to first gather information, then establish a backdoor, and finally spread the infection.

**Final Answer: A**
