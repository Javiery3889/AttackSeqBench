Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are part of an attack lifecycle.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Reconnaissance: Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods.
     - Establishing Communication: Malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers.
     - Installation: The implants are installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after reconnaissance and establishing communication, the implants are installed through employee-enabled macro execution.
     - BlackEnergy 3 is known for its use of malicious macros in Office documents to gain initial access and establish a foothold in the network.
     - The sequence described aligns with the typical attack lifecycle of BlackEnergy 3, where reconnaissance is followed by establishing a C2 channel, and then the malware is installed via social engineering (e.g., tricking employees into opening a malicious document with a macro).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs does not follow the typical attack lifecycle of BlackEnergy 3.
     - This would imply that the implants are installed in a different manner, which does not align with the known TTPs of BlackEnergy 3.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence that follows the typical attack lifecycle of BlackEnergy 3, which includes reconnaissance, establishing C2 communication, and then installing the malware through social engineering (employee-enabled macro execution).
   - The sequence described in the question matches the known TTPs of BlackEnergy 3.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
