To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that Gamaredon gains initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures. This is a common TTP for initial access, often seen in spear-phishing campaigns.

2. **Execution**: After gaining initial access, the next step is to execute a payload. The question does not specify the exact payload, but it implies that the group might use the native `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task.

3. **Persistence**: The question then mentions achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry. This is a common method to ensure the malware remains active even after a system reboot.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the group would use the `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry. While the `at` command can be used to schedule tasks, it is not the most common or efficient method for persistence in the context of the Gamaredon group's known tactics. Gamaredon is known to use more sophisticated methods for persistence, such as registry keys, scheduled tasks, or other less detectable techniques.

- **B: No** - This choice suggests that the group would not use the `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry. This is more aligned with the known tactics of the Gamaredon group, which often prefer more stealthy and less detectable methods for persistence.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs, considering the known tactics of the Gamaredon group, is that they would not use the `at` Windows task scheduler tool for this purpose.

Final Answer: B
