To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the options.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability. This indicates that the attackers used a specific exploit to gain initial access to the victim network.

2. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The question asks if the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

**Analysis of Answer Choices**:

- **Option A: Yes**
  - If the attackers harvested user's login credentials, it suggests they were directly targeting sensitive information rather than using a more indirect method like phishing domains.
  - Harvesting credentials can be a direct and effective method to gain deeper access to the network, especially if the credentials are for administrative or privileged accounts.

- **Option B: No**
  - If the attackers did not harvest user's login credentials and instead used phishing domains, it implies they were using a more indirect method to gather information.
  - Phishing domains are often used to trick users into providing their credentials, which can be a common tactic in initial reconnaissance phases.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access was through an unpatched vulnerability, indicating a direct exploit.
2. The question specifically asks about the reconnaissance phase, where the attackers would likely gather as much information as possible.
3. Harvesting credentials directly provides the attackers with immediate access to sensitive information, which is a more direct and effective method compared to phishing domains.

**Conclusion**:
Given the context of the attack and the direct nature of the initial access, it is more plausible that the attackers would focus on harvesting credentials rather than using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A**
