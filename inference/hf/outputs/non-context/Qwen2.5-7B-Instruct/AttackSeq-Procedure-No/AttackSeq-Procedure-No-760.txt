To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The attackers have already used images in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems.
   - The next step is to gather account credentials.

2. **Evaluating the Options:**
   - **Option A: Yes**
     - This suggests that after using images in phishing emails, the attackers will use a keylogger plugin to gather credentials.
     - Keyloggers are known to capture keystrokes, which can be used to steal login credentials.
     - This method is a common and effective way to gather credentials without needing real-time verification or prompting for 2-step verification codes.
   - **Option B: No**
     - This suggests that after using images in phishing emails, the attackers will not use a keylogger plugin but will instead verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for 2-step verification codes.
     - This is less likely because it would require the attackers to have real-time access to the victims' devices and bypass the 2-step verification, which is a more complex and less common approach.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Using images in phishing emails to evade security systems is a sophisticated tactic, but it does not necessarily mean the attackers will revert to a less effective method of credential gathering.
   - Keyloggers are a straightforward and effective method to capture credentials without needing real-time interaction or additional verification steps.
   - The use of a keylogger aligns with the attackers' goal of efficiently gathering credentials, which is a common and practical approach in phishing attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
