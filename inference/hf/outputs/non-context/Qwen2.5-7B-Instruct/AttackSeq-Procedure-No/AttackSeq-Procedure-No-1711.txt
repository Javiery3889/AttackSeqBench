To answer this question, let's break down the sequence of TTPs and evaluate each answer choice.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Black Energy 2:
     1. Communicates with the botnet's command-and-control (C2) center through HTTP requests.
     2. Injects a DLL into the svchost.exe process to maintain persistence.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Black Energy 2 follows the sequence described: it communicates with the C2 center and then injects a DLL into svchost.exe to maintain persistence.
     - This aligns with known TTPs of Black Energy 2, which often uses HTTP for C2 communication and employs DLL injection into svchost.exe to maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Black Energy 2 does not follow the described sequence. However, this contradicts the known behavior of Black Energy 2, which indeed uses these methods.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Black Energy 2 is known to use HTTP for C2 communication.
   - It is also known to inject a DLL into svchost.exe to maintain persistence.
   - The sequence described in the question matches the known TTPs of Black Energy 2.

**Final Answer: A**
