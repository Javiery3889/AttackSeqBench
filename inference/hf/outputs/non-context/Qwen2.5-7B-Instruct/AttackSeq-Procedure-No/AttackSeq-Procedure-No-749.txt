Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The Rising Sun implant initially performs reconnaissance by collecting system and network details. This is a common first step in many cyber attacks to gather information about the target environment.

2. **Data Exfiltration**: The data collected during the reconnaissance phase is then exfiltrated to the control server. The question mentions that the data is encrypted using RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoded for exfiltration.

3. **Communication Method**: The question asks if it is likely that the implant would communicate with the control server using HTTP POST requests, with the data being encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

4. **Analysis of Answer Choices**:
   - **Choice A: Yes** - This suggests that the communication method described (HTTP POST requests with RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding) is plausible and consistent with the TTPs mentioned.
   - **Choice B: No** - This suggests that the communication method described is not plausible or consistent with the TTPs mentioned.

5. **Reasoning**:
   - The use of RC4 for encryption and Base64 for encoding is consistent with the data exfiltration method described.
   - HTTP POST requests are a common method for data transmission over the web, and they can be used to send encrypted and encoded data.
   - The combination of RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding is a plausible method for obfuscating and securing data during exfiltration.

Given the consistency of the communication method with the described TTPs, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is indeed using HTTP POST requests for communication, with the data encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

**Final Answer: A**
