To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the attack begins with delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates. This is a common TTP used by APTs to gain initial access to a network.

2. **Compromise Trusted Commercial Network Resources**: The question then asks if the attackers are likely to compromise trusted commercial network resources to support their operations. Darkhotel APT is known for using trusted commercial network resources as a means to maintain persistence and support their operations. This is a plausible step in their TTPs.

3. **Reconnaissance**: The question specifies that this compromise is done only before performing reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans. Darkhotel APT is known for conducting targeted attacks, often focusing on high-value targets such as government officials and business executives. They typically gather detailed information about their targets, including travel plans, to better position themselves for a successful attack.

Given the above analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of the Darkhotel APT. They often use trusted commercial network resources to support their operations and then conduct reconnaissance to gather detailed information about their targets.

**Final Answer: A**
