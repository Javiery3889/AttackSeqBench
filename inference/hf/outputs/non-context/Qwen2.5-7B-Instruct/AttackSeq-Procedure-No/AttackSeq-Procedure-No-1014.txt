To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Attack Vector**: The question states that the campaign uses social engineering in malicious documents to trick victims into enabling macros for payload activation. This is a common initial attack vector where attackers use social engineering to deliver a payload via a document with macros.

2. **Payload Activation**: Once the macros are enabled, the payload is activated. This payload could be a variety of things, such as a malicious executable or a script that performs further actions.

3. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: The question then asks if it is likely that the campaign will create a pipe to enable inter-process communication. While creating a pipe for IPC is a possible action, it is not a common or necessary step immediately after payload activation. IPC is more commonly used for communication between processes within the same system, which might be a later step in the attack lifecycle.

4. **Persistence**: The question also mentions achieving persistence by adding script paths to the task scheduler. This is a common method for ensuring that the malware remains active even after the initial infection vector is removed. Adding a script path to the task scheduler is a direct method of achieving persistence.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that creating a pipe for IPC is a likely step after payload activation and before achieving persistence. However, as discussed, creating a pipe for IPC is not a common or necessary step immediately after payload activation. It is more likely to be a step that occurs later in the attack lifecycle.

- **B: No** - This choice suggests that creating a pipe for IPC is not a likely step after payload activation and before achieving persistence. Given the common attack patterns and the sequence of TTPs, this is a more plausible sequence. Payload activation typically leads directly to persistence mechanisms, such as adding a script path to the task scheduler, without the need for creating a pipe for IPC.

**Final Answer: B**
