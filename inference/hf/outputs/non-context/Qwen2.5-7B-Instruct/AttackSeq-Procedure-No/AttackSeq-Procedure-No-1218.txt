To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the given information and answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - T9000 steals sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives during the collection phase.
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to exfiltrate the collected data using the MIME protocol.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed use the MIME protocol to exfiltrate the data.
     - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is commonly used for sending binary data over email, which can be a plausible method for exfiltrating data.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use the MIME protocol for exfiltration.
     - While this is possible, it is less likely without additional context that explicitly rules out MIME or indicates a different exfiltration method.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - T9000 is a known malware that has been associated with various TTPs, including data exfiltration.
   - The use of MIME for exfiltration is a common method, especially for sensitive data that needs to be disguised as regular email content to avoid detection.
   - There is no information provided that would suggest MIME is an unlikely or inappropriate method for T9000 to use.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the commonality of using MIME for data exfiltration and the lack of any contradictory information, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T9000 would use MIME to exfiltrate the collected data.

**Final Answer: A**
