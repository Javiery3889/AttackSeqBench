To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Targeting**: The attack starts with a spear phishing campaign targeting officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. This is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks, as it allows the attackers to gain the trust of the target and deliver malicious content.

2. **Delivery of Malicious Content**: The question suggests that the attack will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files to victims. While social media can be a vector for delivering malicious content, it is not a typical or primary method for delivering files in spear phishing campaigns. Spear phishing campaigns usually involve emails with malicious attachments or links.

3. **Downloading a Crimson RAT**: The attack sequence ends with downloading a Crimson RAT (Remote Access Tool) from a specified IP address. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain persistent access to the victim's system and maintain control over it.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the attack sequence involves using social media to deliver malicious files, which is not a typical method for spear phishing campaigns. While social media can be used, it is not the most likely or common method in this context.

- **B: No** - This choice suggests that the attack sequence does not involve using social media to deliver malicious files, which aligns more closely with the typical methods used in spear phishing campaigns (emails with malicious attachments or links).

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attack involves a spear phishing campaign via email, followed by downloading a Crimson RAT from a specified IP address. The use of social media to deliver malicious files is not a typical or likely method in this scenario.

**Final Answer: B**
