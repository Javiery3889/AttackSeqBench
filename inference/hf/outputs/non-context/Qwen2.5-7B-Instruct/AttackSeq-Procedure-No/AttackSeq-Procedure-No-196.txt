To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the RevengeHotels campaign, let's analyze the given information and the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - The campaign involves capturing credentials from compromised hotel systems and online travel agencies.
   - These credentials are then sold to other cybercriminals.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign would utilize tools to capture mouse movements.
     - While capturing credentials is a common TTP, the specific mention of capturing mouse movements is not directly related to the primary objective of credential theft. Mouse movement capture is more commonly associated with keylogging or other forms of data exfiltration rather than credential theft.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign would not utilize tools to capture mouse movements.
     - Given that the primary objective is to capture credentials, which are typically stored in memory or files, the use of mouse movement capture tools would be less relevant and less likely.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The RevengeHotels campaign's primary goal is to steal credentials, which can be achieved through various methods such as keylogging, screen scraping, or other forms of data exfiltration.
   - Mouse movement capture is not a standard or necessary TTP for credential theft. It is more relevant for other types of data exfiltration or for understanding user behavior.
   - The question does not provide any specific indication that mouse movement capture was used in the RevengeHotels campaign.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the RevengeHotels campaign does not include the use of tools to capture mouse movements.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: Final Answer: B
