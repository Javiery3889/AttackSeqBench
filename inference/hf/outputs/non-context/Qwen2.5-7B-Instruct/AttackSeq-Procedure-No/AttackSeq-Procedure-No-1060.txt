To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access via JavaScript Downloader:**
   - The question mentions that the initial access is gained via a JavaScript downloader that employs `ActiveXObject` to execute PowerShell commands. This is a plausible initial access method, as JavaScript can be used to download and execute malicious payloads, and `ActiveXObject` can be used to run PowerShell commands in a browser environment.

2. **Blind Eagle's TTPs:**
   - **Registry Key for Configuration Storage:** Blind Eagle is known to use registry keys for storing configuration data. This is a common method for persistence and to avoid detection by monitoring system files.
   - **Persistence through System Startup:** Blind Eagle is also known to use VBScript placed in the Startup folder to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts. This is a typical persistence mechanism.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression: gaining initial access, storing configuration in a registry key, and then ensuring persistence through the Startup folder.
   - This sequence aligns with the known TTPs of Blind Eagle, as it involves both persistence and configuration storage.

4. **Answer Choices Evaluation:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence and the known TTPs of Blind Eagle.
   - **B: No** - This choice would imply that the sequence described does not match Blind Eagle's known TTPs, which is not the case based on the information provided.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
