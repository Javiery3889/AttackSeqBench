To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the steps and the behavior of APT28, a known threat actor.

1. **Deploying Additional Modules**: The question mentions that APT28 deploys additional modules like pr.dll. This is a common TTP for APT28, as they often use custom or modified tools to achieve their objectives.

2. **Uploading Stolen Data**: After deploying these modules, APT28 uploads stolen data to a Command and Control (C&C) server. This is another typical behavior of APT28, as they often exfiltrate data to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

3. **Discovery by Scanning IP Ranges**: The question then asks if APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. APT28 is known to use various reconnaissance techniques, including scanning for open ports and services to identify potential targets. This aligns with the TTP of scanning IP ranges to find vulnerable systems.

4. **Geographically Distributed Bots**: The question specifies that this discovery is done using geographically distributed bots. APT28 has been observed using botnets and distributed scanning techniques to conduct reconnaissance, which fits this description.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the typical behavior of APT28. They often use scanning techniques to identify vulnerable systems and may employ geographically distributed bots to conduct these scans.

- **B: No**: This choice would imply that APT28 does not use scanning techniques or geographically distributed bots for reconnaissance, which contradicts their known tactics.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best aligned with the "Yes" option.

Final Answer: A
