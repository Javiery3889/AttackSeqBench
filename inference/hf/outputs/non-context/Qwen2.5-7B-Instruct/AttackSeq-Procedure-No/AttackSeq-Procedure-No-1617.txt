To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Regin during the discovery phase, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions two specific TTPs: 
     1. Monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes.
     2. Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
     3. Scanning for deleted files.
   - These TTPs are part of the discovery phase, which is the initial phase of an attack where the adversary seeks to understand the target environment.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Regin would perform all three TTPs mentioned in the question.
     - Monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic are indeed common TTPs for Regin, as it is known for its sophisticated network reconnaissance capabilities.
     - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization is also a known TTP for Regin, as it has been observed to collect detailed information about the target system.
     - Scanning for deleted files is less common but not entirely out of the realm of possibility for Regin, as it has been known to perform various data exfiltration and persistence techniques.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Regin would not perform the mentioned TTPs.
     - Given Regin's known capabilities, this seems unlikely, as it is designed to gather as much information as possible about the target environment.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its extensive data collection capabilities.
   - Monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic are core functionalities of Regin.
   - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization is a well-documented TTP for Regin.
   - While scanning for deleted files is less common, it is not entirely out of the scope of Regin's known activities.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Regin during the discovery phase is indeed the one described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
