Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1195 Supply Chain Compromise:** This is the initial access vector where the attackers use a compromised software update to gain entry into the target network.
   - **Resource Development:** This involves the attackers acquiring and preparing infrastructure for future use, such as parking domains.

2. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers would park domains after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.
   - T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) is a method to gain initial access, and Resource Development is a subsequent step where attackers prepare infrastructure.
   - It is a plausible sequence for attackers to first gain access and then prepare for future operations by parking domains.

3. **Compare Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This aligns with the plausible sequence of TTPs as described.
   - **B: No** - This would imply that attackers would not park domains after gaining initial access, which is less likely given the nature of their Resource Development efforts.

**Final Answer: A**
