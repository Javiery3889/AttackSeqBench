Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The attackers have already installed persistence mechanisms on new systems.
   - They are now considering lateral movement.
   - They have completed the discovery phase, which involves gathering information about systems, users, and data relevant to their mission.

2. **Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The attackers have installed persistence mechanisms to ensure they can maintain access to the compromised systems.
   - **Discovery:** They have gathered information about the network, systems, users, and data.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The next step is to move from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that after persistence and discovery, the attackers will indeed use remote services to achieve lateral movement.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that the attackers will not use remote services for lateral movement after persistence and discovery.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence:** This is a common tactic to ensure long-term access.
   - **Discovery:** This phase is crucial for identifying valuable targets and understanding the network layout.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This is typically the next step after gathering enough information to identify valuable targets. Remote services are often used to move between systems, especially in environments with strict local network controls.

Given the typical sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks, it is highly plausible that the attackers would use remote services to achieve lateral movement after persistence and discovery.

**Final Answer: A**
