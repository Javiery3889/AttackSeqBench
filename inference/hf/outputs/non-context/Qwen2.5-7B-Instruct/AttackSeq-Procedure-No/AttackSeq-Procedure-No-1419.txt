Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is:
     1. Retrieval of the Scanbox payload.
     2. Use of the FriarFox malicious browser extension to contact a command and control (C2) server.
     3. Execution of phishing emails impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association' to deliver the extension for initial access.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs as described in the question is correct. The threat actors would use the FriarFox malicious browser extension to contact a C2 server before delivering the phishing emails.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs as described in the question is incorrect. The threat actors would not use the FriarFox malicious browser extension to contact a C2 server before delivering the phishing emails.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a specific sequence of actions where the FriarFox malicious browser extension is used to contact a C2 server before delivering phishing emails. This sequence is plausible and follows a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns, where initial access is gained through a malicious extension, and then the threat actors use this access to deliver more sophisticated payloads like phishing emails.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with typical APT tactics where initial access is gained, and then the threat actors use this foothold to deploy more sophisticated and targeted attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
