To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Privilege Escalation via DLL Sideloading**: This is a common technique used by APTs to gain elevated privileges on a system. APT10 has been known to use such methods.

2. **Evading Defenses by Loading a Malicious DLL**: This step involves the attacker using a malicious DLL to inject malware into memory, which is another known tactic of APT10.

3. **Injecting Trochilus Payloads into Memory**: Trochilus is a backdoor used by APT10 to maintain persistence and gain access to systems. This is consistent with APT10's known TTPs.

4. **Gathering Encryption Keys from Azure AD Services**: This step involves the attacker attempting to extract encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) servers. This is a significant step that would allow the attacker to access sensitive information and potentially gain further access to the network.

5. **Accessing Visma's Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller**: After obtaining the necessary encryption keys, the attacker would be able to access the domain controller, which is a critical component of the network infrastructure.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible scenario is that APT10 would indeed gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to access the domain controller. This aligns with the known tactics and objectives of APT10, which often target high-value assets and use sophisticated methods to maintain access and control over the network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
