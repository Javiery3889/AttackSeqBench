To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where PyFlash backdoor gathers OS-related information and sends it to a C&C server.
   - It then asks if NetFlash and PyFlash are likely to use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers using Asymmetric Cryptography.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PyFlash:** The question mentions that PyFlash gathers OS-related information and sends it to a C&C server. This is a common TTP for backdoors, but the question does not provide information about the communication method used by PyFlash.
   - **NetFlash:** The question does not provide any specific information about NetFlash, but it is implied that NetFlash is another backdoor or malware that might communicate with a C&C server.
   - **HTTPS and Asymmetric Cryptography:** HTTPS is a protocol that uses both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to secure communications. Asymmetric cryptography is used for key exchange and digital signatures, while symmetric cryptography is used for the actual data encryption.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **PyFlash:** Since the question does not provide specific information about the communication method used by PyFlash, we cannot definitively say whether it uses HTTPS or not.
   - **NetFlash:** Similarly, the question does not provide any specific information about NetFlash, so we cannot definitively say whether it uses HTTPS or not.
   - **HTTPS and Asymmetric Cryptography:** While HTTPS is a common method for secure communication between malware and C&C servers, the question does not provide enough context to determine if both PyFlash and NetFlash use HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the lack of specific information about the communication methods used by PyFlash and NetFlash, and the fact that the question does not provide enough context to determine if both use HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography, the most plausible answer is that we cannot definitively say "Yes" or "No" based on the information provided.

However, since the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs and the answer choices are binary (Yes or No), and considering that HTTPS is a common and secure method for such communications, the most plausible answer would be:

Final Answer: A: Yes
