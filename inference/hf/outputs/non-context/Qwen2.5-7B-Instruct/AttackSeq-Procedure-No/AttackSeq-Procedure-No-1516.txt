To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Backdoor Installation and Data Exfiltration:**
   - The attackers have installed a backdoor on the target system.
   - The backdoor is exfiltrating data over a Command and Control (C&C) channel using encrypted communication.

2. **CaddyWiper Deployment:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to Operational Technology (OT) capabilities and physical drive partitions.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- CaddyWiper is a known malware that targets industrial control systems (ICS) and is designed to wipe data from these systems, particularly focusing on OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.
- Given that the attackers have already installed a backdoor and are exfiltrating data, it is plausible that they might also want to ensure that the target system is rendered unusable or that the data cannot be recovered, especially if the target is an OT environment.
- Deploying CaddyWiper aligns with the attackers' objectives of both exfiltrating data and ensuring the system is compromised beyond repair.

**B: No**
- This choice suggests that the attackers would not deploy CaddyWiper after exfiltrating data.
- This is less likely because deploying CaddyWiper would serve as a final step to ensure the system is unusable and the data cannot be recovered, which is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Given the context of the attack sequence and the nature of CaddyWiper, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers would deploy CaddyWiper after exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: A**
