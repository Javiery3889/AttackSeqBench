To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the options.

1. **NewPass Implant**: This is the initial malware that uses a loader library to decode the configuration file and evade detection. This step is a standard initial compromise and evasion technique.

2. **Loader Library**: The loader library is used to decode the configuration file, which is a common technique to avoid static analysis and ensure the malware can adapt to different environments.

3. **Download via FTP**: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will initiate a download via FTP. FTP is a common protocol for file transfer, but it is often considered less secure and less stealthy compared to modern methods like HTTPS or encrypted channels.

4. **Exfiltration via Encrypted POST Requests**: The malware is then said to exfiltrate information using encrypted POST requests. This is a more sophisticated and stealthy method of data exfiltration, as it uses encryption to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This would imply that after the initial steps of using a loader library to decode the configuration file, the malware would then use FTP to download additional components and then exfiltrate data using encrypted POST requests. While FTP is a common method, it is generally less stealthy and less secure than using encrypted channels for data exfiltration. The use of FTP for downloading additional components might be seen as a less sophisticated step compared to using a more modern and stealthy method.

- **B: No**: This would imply that the malware would not use FTP for downloading additional components and would instead use a more modern and stealthy method, such as encrypted channels, for both downloading and exfiltrating data.

Given the context of the NewPass implant and the emphasis on stealth and evasion, it is more plausible that the malware would use a more modern and secure method for both downloading and exfiltrating data. Therefore, the use of FTP for downloading additional components seems less likely in this scenario.

**Final Answer: B: No**
