To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given scenario and the answer choices.

1. **SLUB Backdoor Behavior**: The SLUB backdoor is known to perform discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute. This indicates that the backdoor is capable of downloading and executing external scripts or commands.

2. **Exfiltration Method**: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will exfiltrate data by directly downloading cloud user data such as OneDrive files. This implies a method of data exfiltration where the backdoor would download files from a cloud storage service like OneDrive.

3. **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **Choice A: Yes** - This suggests that the attackers would use the backdoor to download OneDrive files directly for exfiltration. While this is a plausible method, it might not be the most efficient or common method, especially if the backdoor already has the capability to download and execute external scripts.
   - **Choice B: No** - This suggests that the attackers would not use the backdoor to download OneDrive files directly for exfiltration. This could be true if the backdoor is designed to follow a more sophisticated or indirect method of data exfiltration, such as using a command and control (C2) server to relay the data.

4. **Reasoning**:
   - The SLUB backdoor's behavior of downloading and executing external scripts suggests a more flexible and potentially more sophisticated approach to data handling. Directly downloading OneDrive files might be a simpler method but could also be less stealthy or less efficient.
   - In many cases, attackers prefer methods that are less likely to be detected or traced back to them, which might involve more complex data exfiltration techniques.

Given the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that the attackers might not directly download OneDrive files using the backdoor, but rather use a more sophisticated method.

**Final Answer: B**
