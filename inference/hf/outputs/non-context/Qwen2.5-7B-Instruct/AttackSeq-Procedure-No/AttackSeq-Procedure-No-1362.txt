To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the information provided and the answer choices.

1. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - VERMIN malware collects system information using WMI queries.
   - The malware does not store keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a folder under `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.
   - The question asks whether the malware will utilize tools to capture mouse movements.

2. **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after collecting system information, the malware will use tools to capture mouse movements.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use tools to capture mouse movements.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question does not provide any information about the malware's behavior regarding mouse movements. It only mentions that the malware does not store keystrokes and clipboard data in a specific folder.
   - The VERMIN malware is known for its ability to collect system information and perform other actions, but the specific TTP of capturing mouse movements is not mentioned in the provided context.
   - Since the question does not provide any information that would indicate the malware will capture mouse movements, and the only information given is about the exclusion of keystroke and clipboard data storage, it is reasonable to assume that the malware might not capture mouse movements as well.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the lack of information supporting the capture of mouse movements and the explicit mention of not storing keystrokes and clipboard data, the most plausible answer is that the malware will not capture mouse movements.

**Final Answer: B: No**
