To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the information provided and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Metadata and Content Collection**: The question states that the malware collects metadata and content from local systems and removable media. This is a common initial step in many malware operations, as it helps the attacker understand the environment and gather sensitive information.

2. **Data Exfiltration via Encrypted Custom TCP-Based Protocol**: The question then mentions that the malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol. This is a sophisticated method of data exfiltration that helps to avoid detection by network security systems.

3. **Gathering Data from Network Shared Drives**: Finally, the question asks if the malware is likely to gather data from network shared drives after the initial exfiltration. This step is not explicitly mentioned in the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after exfiltrating data via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol, the malware will proceed to gather data from network shared drives. However, the question does not mention this step, making it less likely to be part of the sequence.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not gather data from network shared drives after the initial exfiltration. Given that the question does not mention this step, this answer aligns better with the information provided.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs: metadata and content collection, followed by data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.
2. The question does not mention any subsequent step of gathering data from network shared drives.
3. Answer Choice A introduces an additional step that is not mentioned in the question.
4. Answer Choice B aligns with the information provided in the question.

**Final Answer: No**
