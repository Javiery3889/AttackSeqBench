To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step:

1. **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
   - The question mentions the use of system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance.
   - It also states that the group gained initial access through malicious documents with job offers.

2. **Lateral Movement:**
   - The question asks if the Lazarus Group leveraged compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement across the network.

3. **Network Share Discovery:**
   - The question then asks if the group used `net user` and `SMBMap` for network share discovery.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:** The use of `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance and gaining initial access through malicious documents are plausible TTPs for the Lazarus Group.
- **Lateral Movement:** The Lazarus Group is known to use compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement, which is a common tactic.
- **Network Share Discovery:** The use of `net user` and `SMBMap` for network share discovery is also a plausible TTP, as these tools are commonly used for network reconnaissance and privilege escalation.

**B: No**
- This option would imply that the Lazarus Group did not use compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement and did not use `net user` and `SMBMap` for network share discovery. However, both of these TTPs are well-documented and align with the Lazarus Group's known tactics.

### Conclusion:
Given the known tactics of the Lazarus Group, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible. The group is known to use a variety of methods for reconnaissance, initial access, lateral movement, and network share discovery, which aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
