To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Leveraging Heavily Obfuscated Malicious DLLs for Defense Evasion:**
   - This is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection by security software. PlugX, a known malware family, often employs obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

2. **Executing Payloads Using EnumThreadWindows:**
   - This is a method used to inject code into a process. The `EnumThreadWindows` function is used to enumerate all top-level windows in a thread, which can be used to inject code into a process. This is a known technique used by malware to gain control over a system.

3. **Opening a Decoy Document Dropped in the %Temp% Folder:**
   - This step is less common but can be a tactic to mislead the user or security tools. By dropping a decoy document in the temporary folder, the malware can create a false positive or divert attention from the actual malicious activity.

4. **Communicating with a C2 Server Using an Application Layer Protocol:**
   - This is a standard method for malware to establish a command and control (C2) channel. Application layer protocols like HTTP or HTTPS are often used to blend in with normal traffic and evade detection.

Given the above analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known TTPs used by malware like PlugX.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The question describes a sequence of TTPs that are consistent with known malware behavior.
2. The use of obfuscated DLLs and `EnumThreadWindows` for injection is a common evasion technique.
3. Dropping a decoy document in the %Temp% folder is a plausible step to mislead the user or security tools.
4. Communicating with a C2 server using an application layer protocol is a standard method for malware to establish a connection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
