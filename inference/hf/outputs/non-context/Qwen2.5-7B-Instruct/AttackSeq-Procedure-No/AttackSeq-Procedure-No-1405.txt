To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each step.

1. **WMI for Lateral Movement**: The question mentions that FIN13 uses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) for lateral movement across the victim network. This is a common TTP used by APTs to move laterally within a network.

2. **Memory Dumping LSASS**: The question states that FIN13 gains credentials via memory dumping LSASS. LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is a Windows service that manages security-related information, including user credentials. Memory dumping LSASS is a well-known technique used by APTs to extract credentials from memory.

3. **Network Sniffing**: The question also mentions that FIN13 uses network sniffing to gather information. Network sniffing involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to extract sensitive information, such as credentials or other data.

4. **Gathering Information on User Accounts**: The question asks if FIN13 is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts. This is a plausible step after gaining credentials and sniffing network traffic, as it would allow the attackers to understand the network's user structure and potentially identify high-value targets.

5. **Internal Reconnaissance**: The question specifies that this information gathering is part of internal reconnaissance. Internal reconnaissance is a critical phase in an APT lifecycle, where attackers gather information to understand the network topology, identify valuable assets, and plan further actions.

Given the above analysis, FIN13's TTPs align well with the described sequence. They use WMI for lateral movement, gain credentials via LSASS, and use network sniffing to gather additional information. After these steps, it is reasonable to assume that they would leverage native OS binaries and scripts for further reconnaissance, such as gathering information on user accounts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
