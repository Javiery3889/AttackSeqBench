To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Exploiting CVE-2017-11882**: This is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user opens a specially crafted document. This is a common initial access vector for attackers.

2. **Creating a Scheduled Task**: The attackers might use a scheduled task to ensure that their malicious payload is executed repeatedly. The task name \Microsoft\Windows\PLA\Server Manager Performance Monitor is a plausible choice for a legitimate-sounding task that could be used for persistence. This task name is not commonly used by legitimate software, making it a good candidate for an attacker to use for stealth and persistence.

3. **Deploying a PowerShell Backdoor (POWERSHOWER)**: After establishing persistence, the attackers would likely deploy a backdoor to maintain access and control over the compromised system. POWERSHOWER is a known PowerShell-based backdoor, which is a common choice for attackers due to its flexibility and ease of use.

Given this sequence, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the typical attack sequence where initial access is followed by persistence and then the deployment of a backdoor. The use of a scheduled task with a plausible but non-standard name is a common tactic to avoid detection.

- **B: No**: This choice would imply that the attackers would not use persistence or a backdoor, which is less likely given the typical behavior of advanced attackers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
