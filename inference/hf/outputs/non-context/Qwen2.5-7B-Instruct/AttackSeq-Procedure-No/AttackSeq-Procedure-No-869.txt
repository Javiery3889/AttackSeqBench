Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware scans for files and stages data for exfiltration during the Collection phase.
   - The data is sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports.

2. **Evaluate the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports only after a fallback C&C server becomes operational for communications.

3. **Analyze Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the fallback C&C server becomes operational and then the data is sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports. This implies a sequential and conditional action where the fallback server's activation triggers the data exfiltration.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the data is sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports regardless of the fallback C&C server's operational status. This implies a direct and unconditional action.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - In many sophisticated cyber operations, fallback mechanisms are designed to ensure that communication can continue even if the primary C&C server is taken down. This fallback mechanism might be used to establish a new communication channel or to re-establish the original one.
   - The question implies a scenario where the fallback C&C server is embedded in the malware's configuration and becomes operational only after a certain condition is met (e.g., the primary C&C server is down or unreachable). In such a scenario, it is plausible that the malware would wait for the fallback server to become operational before initiating data exfiltration.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context of fallback mechanisms in cyber operations, it is more plausible that the malware would wait for the fallback C&C server to become operational before sending data to the primary C&C server.

**Final Answer: A**
