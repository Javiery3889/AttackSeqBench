To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document:**
   - This step indicates that the initial infection vector is a malicious document that contains a script (likely written in a language like VBA for Microsoft Office documents) that decodes and downloads a CAB file.

2. **Execution of Python scripts to execute payloads:**
   - This step suggests that after the CAB file is downloaded, a Python script is used to execute payloads. This is a plausible step because Python is a versatile language that can be used for various tasks, including executing shell scripts or other executable files.

3. **Using a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges:**
   - This step indicates that the malware uses a technique to bypass User Account Control (UAC) to run the main payload with administrative privileges. This is a common technique used by malware to gain higher privileges on a system.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It is plausible that after downloading a base64-encoded CAB file, a Python script could be used to execute payloads, and then a UAC bypass module could be employed to run the main payload with elevated privileges.

- **B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. It would imply that the malware does not use Python scripts to execute payloads or a UAC bypass module to gain elevated privileges, which contradicts the steps described in the question.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
