To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The question mentions a specific variant of Korplug, which is a malware known for its use in C2 (Command and Control) communications.
   - The sequence of actions described is:
     1. Collecting data from the local system.
     2. Collecting data from removable media.
     3. Collecting data from network shared drives.
   - The question then asks if ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) will be used for C2 communications after these data collection steps.

2. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the data collection steps, ICMP will be used for C2 communications.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ICMP will not be used for C2 communications after the data collection steps.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Korplug Variant:** Korplug is known to use various methods for C2 communications, including HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS tunneling. ICMP is not typically used for C2 communications by Korplug.
   - **Data Collection:** The sequence of data collection (local system, removable media, network shared drives) is a standard TTP for data exfiltration and reconnaissance.
   - **C2 Communication Method:** Given that ICMP is not a common method for C2 communications for Korplug, and considering the typical methods used by this variant, it is unlikely that ICMP would be used for C2 communications after the data collection steps.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical TTPs associated with the Korplug variant and the fact that ICMP is not a common method for C2 communications, the most plausible answer is that ICMP will not be used for C2 communications after the data collection steps.

**Final Answer: B**
