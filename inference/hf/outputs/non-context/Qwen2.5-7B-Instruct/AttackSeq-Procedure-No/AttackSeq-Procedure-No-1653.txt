To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Identify the TTPs in the Question:**
   - Web control server: This suggests the use of a server to manage and control the infrastructure used for the attack.
   - Muddyc3 tool: This is a specific tool used for Command and Control (C2) activities.
   - Spear-phishing attacks: This is the final step in the attack sequence, where the group targets specific individuals or organizations.

2. **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Yes**
   - The MuddyWater APT group is known to use sophisticated methods for C2, and a web control server and the Muddyc3 tool are consistent with their known tactics.
   - Spear-phishing is a common method used by APT groups to deliver malware or gain initial access to a network.
   - The sequence of using a web control server, Muddyc3 for C2, and then conducting spear-phishing attacks aligns with the typical TTPs of the MuddyWater APT group.

3. **Evaluate Answer Choice B: No**
   - This would imply that the MuddyWater APT group did not use a web control server, Muddyc3, or conduct spear-phishing attacks, which contradicts the known tactics of the group.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the known tactics of the MuddyWater APT group.

**Final Answer: Yes**
