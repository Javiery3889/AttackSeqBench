To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the information provided and the answer choices.

1. **InfoOS Module**: This module gathers system information such as IOPlatformUUID and operating system version. This is a common initial reconnaissance step to understand the target environment.

2. **XAgent Component**: After gathering the necessary information, the XAgent component is likely to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server. This communication is typically used to receive further instructions or commands from the attackers.

3. **HTTPChannel Module**: This module is used for communication with the C&C server, likely to send and receive data over HTTP.

4. **Hello Message**: The question specifically mentions that the XAgent component sends a "hello" message to the C&C server before receiving commands.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the XAgent component communicates with the C&C server to receive commands via the HTTPChannel module only after sending a "hello" message. This aligns with the typical behavior of many malware components, where they first establish a connection and then proceed to receive further instructions.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the XAgent component does not follow the described sequence, which would imply that it either does not send a "hello" message or does not use the HTTPChannel module for communication with the C&C server.

Given the typical behavior of malware components and the specific sequence described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the XAgent component does indeed send a "hello" message before receiving commands via the HTTPChannel module.

**Final Answer: A**
