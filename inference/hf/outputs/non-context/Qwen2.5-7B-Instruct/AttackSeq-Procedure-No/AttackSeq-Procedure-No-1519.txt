Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The attackers create a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence.
   - **Exploitation:** They exploit Equation Editor vulnerabilities.
   - **Tool Used:** They use the RoyalRoad tool.
   - **Infection Chain:** They initiate a multi-stage infection chain.
   - **Initial Access:** They gain initial access through spear-phishing emails.
   - **Malicious DOCX Documents:** The spear-phishing emails contain malicious DOCX documents.
   - **Remote Template Technique:** The malicious DOCX documents employ the remote template technique.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
     - The sequence of actions (persistence, exploitation, tool usage, infection chain, initial access, malicious documents, and remote template technique) aligns with a sophisticated attack scenario often seen in advanced persistent threats (APTs).
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.
     - However, the sequence described is a common and plausible attack vector, especially for APTs that use sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and spread laterally within a network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the detailed and plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the sequence is indeed likely to occur.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: "Final Answer: A"
