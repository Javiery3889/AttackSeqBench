To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the information provided and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Elfin exfiltrated data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.**
   - This indicates that Elfin used specific tools for data exfiltration, which are likely to be part of their TTPs.

2. **Is it likely that they established command and control using POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT?**
   - POSHC2 (PowerShell C2) and Quasar RAT (Remote Access Tool) are both known to be used for establishing and maintaining command and control (C2) channels in cyber operations.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Context:**
   - The question is about the likelihood of Elfin using specific C2 tools after exfiltrating data.

2. **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Yes**
   - POSHC2 and Quasar RAT are both sophisticated tools used for C2. If Elfin has already exfiltrated data, it is plausible that they would use these tools to maintain a persistent presence and control over the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate Answer Choice B: No**
   - This would imply that Elfin did not use POSHC2 or Quasar RAT for C2, which is less likely given the nature of these tools and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors.

### Conclusion:
Given that POSHC2 and Quasar RAT are well-documented and effective for establishing and maintaining C2, it is reasonable to assume that Elfin would use these tools after exfiltrating data to ensure continued access and control.

**Final Answer: A**
