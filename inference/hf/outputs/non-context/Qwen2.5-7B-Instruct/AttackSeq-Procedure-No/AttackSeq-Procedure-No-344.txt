To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Identify the TTPs in the Question:**
   - The zero-day exploit is identified by FireEye Research Labs.
   - The exploit executes native Windows functions such as `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo`.
   - The exploit then bypasses Windows' Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) protections.
   - Finally, the exploit executes shellcode that downloads the next stage payload.

2. **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Yes**
   - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It confirms that the zero-day exploit indeed executes native Windows functions, bypasses ASLR and DEP, and then executes shellcode to download the next stage payload.

3. **Evaluate Answer Choice B: No**
   - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It would imply that the zero-day exploit does not execute native Windows functions, does not bypass ASLR and DEP, or does not execute shellcode to download the next stage payload.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, Answer Choice A is the most plausible sequence of TTPs as it accurately reflects the attack sequence described in the question.

Final Answer: Yes
