Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware, specifically Longhorn.
   - The first TTP mentioned is "communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals."
   - The second TTP is the configuration of a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C (Command and Control) communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
     - This aligns with the described TTPs, as it involves a targeted and stealthy approach to C&C communication, which is consistent with advanced malware like Longhorn.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
     - This does not align with the described TTPs, as it would imply a less targeted and less stealthy approach to C&C communication.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sophisticated and targeted approach to C&C communication, which is consistent with the TTPs of advanced malware like Longhorn.
   - The use of a specific domain and IP address combination per target, along with HTTPS and a custom cryptographic protocol, indicates a high level of sophistication and stealth.
   - Answer Choice A aligns with this description, while Answer Choice B does not.

**Final Answer: A**
