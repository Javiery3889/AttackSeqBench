To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and known cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports.

1. **Initial TTP: Proxy Servers**
   - The question mentions that the threat actor uses proxy servers within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect. This is a common TTP used by threat actors to obfuscate their activities and evade detection.

2. **Exploit Server**
   - The question then mentions an exploit server used by RIG EK. RIG EK is known to use exploit kits, which typically deliver malware to victims through web exploits.

3. **Domain Fronting**
   - The question asks if the exploit server will use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic. Domain fronting is a technique where the domain name in the HTTPS handshake is different from the actual destination of the traffic. This technique is often used to bypass network security controls and to hide the true destination of the traffic.

4. **CDN Hosting**
   - The question specifies that the destination of the network traffic is disguised as another server hosted in the same CDN. This is a specific use case of domain fronting where the threat actor leverages a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to host the fronted domain.

5. **Likelihood of TTP Sequence**
   - RIG EK, as a known threat actor, has been observed using domain fronting in its operations to evade detection and to maintain command and control (C2) communications. The use of a CDN to host the fronted domain is a plausible and effective method to disguise the true destination of the network traffic.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed the use of domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic as another server hosted in the same CDN.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
