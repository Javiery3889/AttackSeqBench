To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the attack begins with "initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document." This is a common TTP where attackers use social engineering to deliver a payload.

2. **Execution of COM Object**: The next step mentioned is that a "COM object will execute queries to gather system information." This is a plausible TTP as COM objects can be used to execute arbitrary code and gather system details, which is often a precursor to further exploitation.

3. **Download of Malware**: The final step is that "payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware will be downloaded." Both Ursnif and GandCrab are known to be downloaded via such methods, with Ursnif being a banking trojan and GandCrab being a ransomware variant.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. Phishing emails leading to a malicious Word document, execution of a COM object to gather system information, and then downloading of specific malware payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab) are all plausible and consistent with known attack patterns.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. It would imply that the steps described do not occur, which contradicts the typical behavior of such attacks.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is supported by Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
