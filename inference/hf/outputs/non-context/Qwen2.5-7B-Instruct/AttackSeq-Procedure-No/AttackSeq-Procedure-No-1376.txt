Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT28:
1. A malicious document is used.
2. The document leverages DDE via PowerShell to achieve execution.
3. The document downloads and runs encoded commands.

The question then asks if it is likely to observe the document hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware to execute on system startup.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
- Answer Choice B: No

APT28 is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence on a compromised system. One common method to achieve persistence is by modifying or hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts. This allows the malware to run every time the system starts up, ensuring long-term access.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- APT28's tactics often involve persistence mechanisms to ensure long-term access to the compromised system.
- Hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts is a well-documented method used by APT28 to achieve persistence.
- Given the described sequence of TTPs, it is highly plausible that APT28 would leverage this technique to ensure the malware executes on system startup.

Final Answer: A
