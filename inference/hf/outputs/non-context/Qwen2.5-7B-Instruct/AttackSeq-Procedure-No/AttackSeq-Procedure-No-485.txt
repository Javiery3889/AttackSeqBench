To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Credential Dumping**: The question mentions that FamousSparrow uses a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access. This is a common TTP in initial access and credential access stages.

2. **Reading File Contents**: The question then asks if FamousSparrow is likely to read file contents. This is a separate TTP that could occur after credential dumping but is not necessarily a standard or immediate next step in the attack sequence described.

3. **Exfiltration**: The question asks if the file contents are likely to be exfiltrated to a C&C server. Exfiltration is a TTP that typically occurs after the attacker has gathered the desired data.

4. **System Information Collection**: The question mentions that FamousSparrow is likely to collect system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types during the Discovery phase. This is a common TTP in the Discovery phase of an attack.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible sequence would be:
- Credential Dumping (T1003)
- System Information Collection (T1082)
- Exfiltration (T1041)

Reading file contents (T1033) is not a standard or immediate next step in the sequence described, and it is not typically part of the Discovery phase.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. Credential Dumping is a common initial step.
2. System Information Collection is a standard step in the Discovery phase.
3. Exfiltration is a common step after data has been gathered.
4. Reading file contents is not a standard step in the sequence described.

**Final Answer: No (B)**
