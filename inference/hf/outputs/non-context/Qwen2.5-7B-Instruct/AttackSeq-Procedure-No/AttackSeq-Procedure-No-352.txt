To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file. This is a common initial access vector for malware, particularly those targeting Office documents.

2. **Downloader File**: The embedded downloader file is likely to perform some basic checks or actions to ensure it is running in the correct environment and to gather information about the system.

3. **Execution of Native Windows Functions**: MSIL/Crimson malware, which is a .NET-based malware, is known to use native Windows functions for various purposes, including gathering system information and performing actions. The functions `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo` are indeed used by malware to gather system details, which can be useful for establishing a foothold and understanding the environment.

4. **Command and Control (C2) Establishment**: After gathering necessary information, the malware would typically establish a C2 channel to communicate with its command and control server. A custom TCP protocol is a plausible method for this, as it allows for more control over the communication channel and can be obfuscated.

Given this analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the known behavior of MSIL/Crimson malware.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The initial access through an exploit is a common method.
- The use of native Windows functions to gather system information is a typical behavior of malware.
- Establishing a custom TCP protocol for C2 is a common method to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
