To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have installed a backdoor on the victim's computer.
   - The backdoor has been used to shut down the victim's computer, which disrupts operations and impacts system availability.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C (Command and Control) channel using encrypted communication after the shutdown.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the system is shut down, the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.
     - While it is possible that the attackers might use encrypted communication to exfiltrate data, the immediate action of shutting down the system to disrupt operations does not necessarily imply that data exfiltration will follow.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that after the system is shut down, the backdoor will not exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.
     - Given that the primary action is to disrupt operations by shutting down the system, it is less likely that the attackers would immediately proceed with data exfiltration, especially if the system is no longer operational.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers' primary goal, as indicated, is to disrupt the victim's operations by shutting down the system.
   - Shutting down the system is a direct action to cause immediate disruption and impact system availability.
   - Exfiltrating data over a C&C channel using encrypted communication is a secondary action that would typically occur after the system is operational and the attackers have established a foothold.
   - Given the sequence of actions described, it is less likely that the attackers would immediately proceed with data exfiltration after the system is shut down.

**Final Answer: B: No**
