To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The campaign starts with phishing emails containing a malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. This is a common method used by attackers to gain initial access to a network.

2. **Exploitation**: After gaining initial access, the attackers are said to exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. This involves using a specific vulnerability in FortiOS to further compromise the system.

3. **Sequence of TTPs**: The sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural) would be:
   - Initial Compromise: Phishing
   - Exploitation: Exploit CVE-2018-13379

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs (phishing followed by exploiting CVE-2018-13379) is plausible.
- **B: No** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.

Given the attack sequence described in the question, where phishing is used to gain initial access and then CVE-2018-13379 is exploited, the sequence of TTPs is indeed plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
