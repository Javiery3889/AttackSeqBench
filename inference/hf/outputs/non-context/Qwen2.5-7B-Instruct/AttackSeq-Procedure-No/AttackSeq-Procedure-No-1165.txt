Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an adversary, specifically ProjectM.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evasion techniques (WHOIS protection for infrastructure)
     - Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in malicious RTF and Excel files
     - Delivery of payloads through these files
     - Use of malicious code (Trojans like Crimson and Peppy)
     - Use of Remote Access Tools (RATs) such as DarkComet and Bozok

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is plausible.
     - WHOIS protection is a common technique to hide the true identity of the infrastructure used by the adversary.
     - Exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF and Excel files is a well-known method for delivering payloads.
     - Using Trojans and RATs for further control and persistence is a typical follow-up after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described is not plausible.
     - However, the sequence described is a common and effective method for adversaries to maintain stealth and control over a compromised system.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common approach for an adversary to maintain stealth and control over a compromised system.
   - WHOIS protection is a standard technique to avoid detection.
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities in common office documents is a widely used method for delivering payloads.
   - Using Trojans and RATs is a typical follow-up to gain further control and maintain persistence.
   - Therefore, the sequence described is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
