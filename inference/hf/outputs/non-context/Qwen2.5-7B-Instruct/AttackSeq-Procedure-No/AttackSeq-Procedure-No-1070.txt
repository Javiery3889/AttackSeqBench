To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Exploit**: The question mentions the use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. This is a common initial attack vector where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in software to deliver malicious payloads.

2. **Payload Delivery**: After the initial exploit, the question suggests that Tropic Trooper (a known threat actor) drops RegAsm.exe onto systems. RegAsm.exe is a legitimate Windows utility used to register .NET assemblies. However, in the context of malicious activities, it can be used to execute arbitrary code, making it a potential payload delivery mechanism.

3. **Malicious Activity**: The next step is to perform malicious activity. This could involve various actions, but the question specifically mentions injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. Dllhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts unmanaged code for COM objects. Injecting a malicious DLL into this process can provide a persistent backdoor for the attackers.

4. **Sequence Evaluation**:
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes** - This choice suggests that after the initial exploit and payload delivery via RegAsm.exe, Tropic Trooper would indeed perform the malicious activity by injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe. This sequence aligns with the typical TTPs used by Tropic Trooper, which often involve using legitimate tools for malicious purposes and leveraging system processes for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No** - This choice would imply that Tropic Trooper does not use RegAsm.exe for payload delivery or does not inject a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe, which contradicts the known TTPs of this threat actor.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is supported by Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
