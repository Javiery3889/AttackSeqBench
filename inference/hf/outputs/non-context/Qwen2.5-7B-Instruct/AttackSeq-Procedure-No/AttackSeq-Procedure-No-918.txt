Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     - Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
     - Using a backdoor to list interesting files such as Office documents during discovery.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will capture passwords by prompting victims with a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window as part of data collection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described method of capturing passwords via a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window is a plausible TTP for Gamaredon's malware.
     - However, the described TTPs (malicious macros and backdoor for file discovery) are more commonly associated with Windows environments, not macOS.
     - The "macOS needs to access System Settings" prompt is not a typical method used by Gamaredon or other known malware families for macOS.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described method is not a plausible TTP for Gamaredon's malware.
     - Given the mismatch between the described TTPs (which are more Windows-centric) and the method of capturing passwords (which is macOS-specific), this choice seems more plausible.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that are more aligned with Windows environments (malicious macros and backdoor for file discovery).
   - The method of capturing passwords via a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window is not a typical or known method used by Gamaredon or other known malware families for macOS.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that Gamaredon's malware would use this method for data collection on macOS.

**Final Answer: B: No**
