Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The PHP script gathers system profile information and stores it in a MySQL database during the discovery phase.
   - The question asks if the C2 MySQL database will contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Option A: Yes**
     - If the C2 MySQL database contains tables describing machines only before the discovery phase, it implies that the database already has information about the machines before the script starts gathering and storing new information.
     - This scenario is less likely because the discovery phase is typically when the attacker gathers new information about the target environment. It is unusual for the database to already contain detailed information about the machines before this phase.
   - **Option B: No**
     - If the C2 MySQL database does not contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase, it means that the database is likely empty or contains minimal information before the script starts gathering and storing new information.
     - This scenario is more plausible because the discovery phase is when the attacker would populate the database with new information about the target environment.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a PHP script gathers system profile information and stores it in a MySQL database during the discovery phase.
   - The discovery phase is the time when the attacker is actively gathering new information about the target environment.
   - It is unlikely that the C2 MySQL database would already contain detailed tables describing machines before the discovery phase, as this would imply that the attacker already had this information, which is not typical of a discovery phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible scenario is that the C2 MySQL database does not contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: B**
