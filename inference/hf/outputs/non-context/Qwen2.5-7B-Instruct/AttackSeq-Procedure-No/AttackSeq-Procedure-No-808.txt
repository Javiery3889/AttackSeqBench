Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - WinDealer is a piece of malware that collects and processes various types of data from a victim's system.
   - The collected data is stored in the %TEMP% directory in ".a" files.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use port-knocking methods to authenticate itself and establish a connection to the C2 server before exfiltrating the data.

2. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - Port-knocking is a method of remotely controlling a service by sending a series of connection requests to specific ports in a specific order. This method is often used to hide the existence of a service and to add an additional layer of security.
     - While port-knocking can be a plausible method for malware to establish a connection to a C2 server, it is not a common or widely used method in malware operations. Most malware uses more straightforward and less detectable methods for establishing a connection.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware does not use port-knocking methods to authenticate and establish a connection to the C2 server.
     - Given that port-knocking is not a common method in malware operations, and considering the typical methods used by malware (such as using open ports, HTTP/HTTPS, or other less detectable protocols), this choice seems more plausible.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question does not provide any specific information that would indicate the use of port-knocking by WinDealer.
   - Port-knocking is not a common or widely used method in malware operations, and the question does not suggest that WinDealer is using this method.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that the malware uses more conventional methods to establish a connection to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B**
