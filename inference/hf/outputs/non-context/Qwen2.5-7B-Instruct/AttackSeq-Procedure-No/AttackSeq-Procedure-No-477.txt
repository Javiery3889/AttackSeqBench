To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP: Deploying tcpdump to scrape credential-containing files for Credential Access**
   - This TTP is clearly mentioned in the question and is a common method for attackers to gather credentials.

2. **Exfiltration Method: Using Tor hidden services**
   - The question suggests that after scraping the files, the next step is to exfiltrate them using Tor hidden services. This is a plausible method for attackers to avoid detection by network security measures.

3. **Subsequent TTP: Enumerating system data directories and GPS information for Discovery**
   - After exfiltrating the credentials, the next step is to enumerate system data directories and GPS information. This is a common step in the Discovery phase of an attack, where the attacker gathers more information about the target environment.

4. **Sequence Evaluation:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after scraping the files, the attacker will use Tor hidden services to exfiltrate the files and then proceed to enumerate system data directories and GPS information. This sequence aligns with the typical attack lifecycle, where attackers first gather credentials, then exfiltrate them, and finally gather more information about the target environment.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attacker will not use Tor hidden services for exfiltration and will not enumerate system data directories and GPS information. This does not align with the sequence described in the question and is less plausible.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:

Final Answer: A
