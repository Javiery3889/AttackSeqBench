Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Exploiting the VBScript Engine Vulnerability**: This is the initial access method, where the attackers use a vulnerability in the VBScript engine to gain initial access to the system.

2. **Watering Hole Attack**: This is a method where the attackers compromise a website that is frequented by their target to deliver malware. This is a common tactic to ensure that the target is exposed to the exploit.

3. **Disabling Security Tools**: After gaining initial access, attackers often aim to disable security tools to maintain persistence and avoid detection. Modifying EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) related services to disable auto-start on system reboot is a plausible method to achieve this.

4. **Downloading and Executing a Backdoor**: Once the security tools are disabled, the attackers can then download and execute a backdoor to maintain long-term access to the system.

Given this sequence, the attackers would likely follow these steps to ensure they can maintain access and avoid detection. Therefore, the sequence described in the question is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
