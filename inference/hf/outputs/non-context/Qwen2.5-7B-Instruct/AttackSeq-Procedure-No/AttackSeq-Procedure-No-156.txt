To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Dynamic-DNS Domains for Command and Control (C2):**
   - APT10 is known to use dynamic-DNS domains for establishing C2 channels. This is a common TTP for maintaining persistence and evading detection.

2. **Data Transfer Using Robocopy and PSCP:**
   - Robocopy is a command-line utility for copying files and directories. It is often used for transferring large amounts of data.
   - PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy Client) is a secure file transfer tool that uses SSH for data transfer. It is used for transferring files securely over a network.

3. **Exfiltration Using MIME Protocol:**
   - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard for formatting and sending non-text data over email. It is commonly used for sending files via email.

Given the sequence of TTPs described:
- Dynamic-DNS domains are used for C2.
- Robocopy and PSCP are used for transferring data.
- The question asks if APT10 is likely to exfiltrate data using the MIME protocol.

**Analysis of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - While MIME is a valid method for exfiltrating data, it is not the most likely method given the context. APT10 is known to use more sophisticated and stealthy methods for exfiltration, such as leveraging legitimate protocols and services to avoid detection.
- **B: No**
  - This is a more plausible answer because APT10 typically uses more advanced and stealthy methods for exfiltration, such as leveraging legitimate services and protocols that are less likely to be detected.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the known TTPs of APT10 and the context provided, the most plausible answer is that APT10 is not likely to exfiltrate data using the MIME protocol.

Final Answer: B: No
