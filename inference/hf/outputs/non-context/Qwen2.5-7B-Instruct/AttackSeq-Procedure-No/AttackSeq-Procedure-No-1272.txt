To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Deployment and Defense Evasion:**
   - The WastedLocker ransomware is deployed using PsExec.
   - PsExec is used to stop services and disable Windows Defender, which are actions to evade detection and ensure the ransomware can run without interference.

2. **Impact Phase:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands during the Impact phase.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- **Reasoning:**
  - Deleting system volume shadow copies is a common tactic used by ransomware to prevent victims from restoring their systems to a previous state.
  - This action aligns with the ransomware's goal of maximizing the impact and ensuring that the victim cannot easily recover their data.
  - The use of PowerShell commands to perform this action is plausible, as PowerShell is a powerful tool often used in Windows environments for administrative tasks.

**B: No**
- **Reasoning:**
  - There is no strong evidence or common practice that suggests ransomware typically avoids deleting system volume shadow copies.
  - This action would not align with the typical objectives of ransomware, which aim to cause maximum disruption and ensure the victim cannot easily recover their data.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the ransomware will indeed delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands during the Impact phase.

**Final Answer: A**
