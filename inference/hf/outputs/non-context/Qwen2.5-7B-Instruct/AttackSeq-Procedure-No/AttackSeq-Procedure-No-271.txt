Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a specific TTP (Mustang Panda's Korplug variant) that uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, involving compressed and encrypted messages.
   - It then asks if this variant is likely to perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Korplug variant is likely to perform data discovery. Data discovery is a common step in the data exfiltration process, where the attacker gathers information about the target system to identify valuable data for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Korplug variant is unlikely to perform data discovery. If the variant is already using a custom protocol for data exfiltration, it might not need to perform additional data discovery since it is already exfiltrating data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Korplug variant is described as using a custom protocol for data exfiltration, which implies that it is already capable of identifying and exfiltrating data.
   - Data discovery is a preparatory step that helps the attacker understand the system's structure and identify valuable data. Since the Korplug variant is already exfiltrating data, it is reasonable to assume that it has already performed data discovery.
   - The use of a custom protocol for exfiltration suggests that the variant is sophisticated and likely has the capability to perform data discovery as part of its initial reconnaissance phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Korplug variant would perform data discovery as part of its initial reconnaissance before exfiltrating data.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: A"
