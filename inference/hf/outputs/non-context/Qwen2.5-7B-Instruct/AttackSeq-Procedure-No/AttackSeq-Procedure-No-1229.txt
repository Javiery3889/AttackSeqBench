Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware.
   - The ransomware encrypted files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm.
   - Ransom notes were left in encrypted directories.
   - The group is likely to have established command and control (C&C) communication using backdoor malware.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after deploying the ransomware and leaving ransom notes, the Lazarus group would establish C&C communication using backdoor malware.
     - The use of backdoor malware to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Lazarus.
     - The deployment of backdoor malware aligns with the typical behavior of APT groups to maintain persistence and control over the compromised systems.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group would not establish C&C communication using backdoor malware.
     - This is less likely because maintaining C&C communication is crucial for APT groups to continue their operations and evade detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Lazarus group would indeed establish C&C communication using backdoor malware.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
