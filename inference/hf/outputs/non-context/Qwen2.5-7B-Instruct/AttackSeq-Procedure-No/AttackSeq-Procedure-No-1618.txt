Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Regin malware during the discovery phase:
     - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
     - Scanning for deleted files.
   - The question then asks if Regin is likely to set auto-forward rules on the victim's email accounts to monitor network traffic after these actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization:** This is a common TTP used by malware to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Scanning for Deleted Files:** This TTP is also used to find sensitive or critical files that may have been deleted by the victim or security measures.
   - **Setting Auto-Forward Rules on Email Accounts:** This TTP is more related to data exfiltration and maintaining persistence rather than the initial discovery phase. While Regin is known for its sophisticated capabilities, setting up auto-forward rules is not a typical TTP for the discovery phase.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The TTPs mentioned (gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files) are more aligned with the initial reconnaissance and understanding of the environment.
   - Setting auto-forward rules on email accounts is more aligned with the later stages of the attack, such as data exfiltration and maintaining persistence.
   - Regin is known for its complex and multi-stage attack, but the question specifically asks about the discovery phase, which typically involves gathering information and understanding the environment.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the TTPs mentioned (gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files) are part of the discovery phase, and setting auto-forward rules is more aligned with later stages, the most plausible answer is that Regin is not likely to perform this action during the discovery phase.

Final Answer: B: No
