Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Establishing persistence by creating a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%`.
   - Setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - Remotely discovering systems over LAN connections.
   - Exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the initial persistence methods (creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry), the malware (Korplug variant) will proceed to remotely discover systems over LAN connections and then exfiltrate data via a custom TCP-based protocol.
     - This sequence aligns with typical behavior of malware that aims to spread laterally within a network and exfiltrate data. The steps described are common in the initial compromise and lateral movement phases of an attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware does not perform the steps of remotely discovering systems over LAN connections and exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol after establishing persistence.
     - This is less likely because the described persistence methods are often used to gain a foothold in a network, and the next logical steps would be to spread and exfiltrate data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A, as it aligns with the typical behavior of malware like Korplug, which aims to spread and exfiltrate data after establishing a foothold in a network.

Final Answer: A
