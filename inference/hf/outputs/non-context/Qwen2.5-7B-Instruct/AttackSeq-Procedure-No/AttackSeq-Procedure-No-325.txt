To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **XAgent App Collection of Processes**: The question states that the XAgent app collects a list of processes for discovery. This is a common initial step in many malware operations where the malware gathers information about the system it has infected.

2. **Sending Data to C2 Server**: After collecting the information, the app sends the gathered data, including the processes data, to a Command and Control (C2) server via HTTP. This is a typical behavior for malware to exfiltrate data to its command center for further instructions or to report back to the attacker.

3. **Hiding Icon and Running in Background**: The question then asks if the app will hide its icon and run in the background on iOS 7 devices only after sending the gathered information. This is a defensive measure to avoid detection by the user or security software. However, the timing of this action (only after sending the data) is crucial.

4. **iOS 7 Consideration**: iOS 7 is an older version of the iOS operating system. While it is possible that XAgent could be designed to run on iOS 7, the question does not provide any specific information about the app's capabilities or the necessity of such a step. However, the question implies that this step is a likely action.

5. **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the app will indeed hide its icon and run in the background after sending the data. This aligns with the typical behavior of malware to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **B: No**: This choice suggests that the app will not perform these actions, which contradicts the typical behavior of malware.

Given the typical behavior of malware and the sequence of actions described, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the app will hide its icon and run in the background after sending the data.

Final Answer: A
