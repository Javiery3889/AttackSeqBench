Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     1. Employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload (Defense Evasion).
     2. Using decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` (Persistence).
     3. Gaining initial access by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document (Initial Access).
     4. Executing these scripts through macro-triggered events (Execution).

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. It aligns with a common tactic where attackers first gain initial access through a malicious document, then use encoded scripts to evade detection, and finally deploy decoded scripts for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible. However, the described sequence is a well-known and effective tactic in many cyber-attacks.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a typical and effective sequence of TTPs used in many cyber-attacks. It follows a logical progression:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gaining entry into the target environment through a malicious document.
     2. **Execution:** Using encoded scripts to evade detection and execute the payload.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** Employing obfuscation to further evade detection.
     4. **Persistence:** Deploying decoded scripts to ensure the payload remains active.

Given the logical and common nature of this sequence, the most plausible answer is that the campaign would indeed follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: Yes**
