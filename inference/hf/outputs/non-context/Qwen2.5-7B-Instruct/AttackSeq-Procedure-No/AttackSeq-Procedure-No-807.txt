To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Initial Communication**: The malware, WinDealer, communicates with C2 servers using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556. This is a standard initial step in many malware operations to establish a connection with the command and control (C2) infrastructure.

2. **Data Collection**: The malware then collects and processes data from various sources such as USB memory, documents, desktop items, recycle bin contents, and SNS application folders. This step involves the malware scanning the system for sensitive data and preparing it for exfiltration.

3. **Data Processing and Encryption**: After collecting the data, the malware processes and encrypts it. This is a common practice to ensure that the data is not easily readable by unauthorized parties.

4. **Data Storage**: The processed and encrypted data is stored in the %TEMP% directory. This is a common practice for malware to store temporary files, as the %TEMP% directory is often used for temporary files and is less likely to be monitored or backed up.

5. **Exfiltration**: Finally, the malware exfiltrates the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server. This is the final step in the attack sequence, where the malware sends the stolen data to the attacker's server for further analysis or use.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It accurately reflects the steps of initial communication, data collection and processing, data storage, and exfiltration.
- **B: No** - This choice does not align with the described sequence of TTPs. It would imply that the malware does not follow the steps described, which contradicts the question.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
