To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **Seaduke's Functionality**:
   - Seaduke is described as a malware that retrieves detailed bot/system information.
   - It also has a 'seppuku' function, which is a term often used in the context of malware to describe a method of self-destruction or self-termination.

2. **Command-and-Control (C2) Port Calculation**:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Seaduke will calculate the C2 port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value.

3. **Analysis of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This suggests that the described method of calculating the C2 port is a plausible TTP for Seaduke.
   - **B: No**: This suggests that the described method of calculating the C2 port is not a plausible TTP for Seaduke.

4. **Reasoning**:
   - The method of calculating the C2 port by multiplying the first two octets and adding the third octet is a specific and somewhat unusual method. While it is not impossible for malware to use such a method, it is not a widely documented or common practice in the context of C2 port calculation.
   - The 'seppuku' function is a known TTP for malware, as it is a method to ensure the malware is removed from the system after its mission is accomplished.
   - The retrieval of detailed bot/system information is also a common TTP for malware to gather intelligence before or during its operation.

Given the analysis, the method of calculating the C2 port as described is not a commonly documented or widely used technique in the context of malware operations. Therefore, it is less likely to be a plausible TTP for Seaduke.

**Final Answer: B: No**
