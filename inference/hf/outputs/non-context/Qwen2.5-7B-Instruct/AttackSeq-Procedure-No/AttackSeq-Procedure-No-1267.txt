Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attackers use SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks to gain initial access.
   - They then deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell for execution.
   - They use commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
     - SocGholish is a tool that can be used to deliver malware, including Cobalt Strike, via malicious JavaScript.
     - Cobalt Strike can be executed using PowerShell, which is a common method for running malicious scripts on Windows systems.
     - The commands "whoami", "net user", and "net group" are typical for reconnaissance and privilege escalation, which are common actions after gaining initial access.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible.
     - There is no clear reason why this sequence would be implausible based on the information provided.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible and common sequence in cyber attacks, the correct answer is "Yes."

Final Answer: A
