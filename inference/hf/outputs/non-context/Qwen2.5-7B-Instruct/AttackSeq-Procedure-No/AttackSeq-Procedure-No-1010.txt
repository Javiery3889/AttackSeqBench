Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The campaign uses malicious documents to deliver payloads.
2. **Execution**: Macros are enabled, leading to file execution in randomly named directories.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The campaign disables driver signing verification by tampering with several Registry keys.
4. **Loading of Rootkit Driver Component**: A rootkit driver component is loaded.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Access and Execution**: These steps are clearly described and align with common attack vectors where malicious documents are used to deliver payloads, and macros are enabled to execute files in random directories.

2. **Defense Evasion**: Disabling driver signing verification is a known tactic used by attackers to evade detection and ensure that their malicious drivers can be loaded into the system. Tampering with Registry keys to disable driver signing is a plausible and common method.

3. **Loading of Rootkit Driver Component**: Rootkits are often used to maintain persistence and hide from the user and system administrators. Loading a rootkit driver component after disabling driver signing verification is a logical next step in the attack sequence.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible sequence is one that includes disabling driver signing verification as a step in the attack chain, which would enable the loading of a rootkit driver component.

### Final Answer:
