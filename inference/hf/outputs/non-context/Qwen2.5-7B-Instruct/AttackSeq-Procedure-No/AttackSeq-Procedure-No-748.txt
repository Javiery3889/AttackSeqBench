To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each step.

1. **Persistence**: The question mentions that the Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder. This is a common TTP where malware ensures it remains active after a system reboot.

2. **Collection of Browser Bookmark Information**: The question then asks if the implant is likely to collect browser bookmark information as part of the discovery phase. This is another TTP where the malware gathers information about the user's browsing habits, which can be useful for tailoring future attacks or understanding the user's online activities.

3. **Communication with Control Servers**: Finally, the question states that the implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests. This is a standard method for malware to exfiltrate data or receive further instructions from the attacker.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described. It suggests that after ensuring persistence, the implant collects browser bookmark information and then communicates with control servers.
- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It would imply that the implant does not collect browser bookmark information, which is not consistent with the attack sequence provided.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
