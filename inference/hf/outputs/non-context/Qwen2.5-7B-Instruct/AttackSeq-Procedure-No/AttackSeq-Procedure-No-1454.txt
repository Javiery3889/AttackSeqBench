To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access Phase**: The adversary sends emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT. This suggests a social engineering tactic to gain initial access to the target network.
- **Resource Development Phase**: The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during this phase.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - ENVYSCOUT is a known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group, and they are known for using sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that include custom malware.
  - Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor are specific pieces of malware associated with ENVYSCOUT. These tools are used to maintain persistence and gather intelligence.
  - The use of custom malware during the Resource Development phase is consistent with the TTPs of ENVYSCOUT and other APT groups.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the adversary would not use custom malware during the Resource Development phase, which contradicts the known TTPs of ENVYSCOUT and similar APT groups.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where the adversary uses social engineering to gain initial access through a PDF link.
- ENVYSCOUT is known to use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase to maintain access and gather intelligence.
- The use of custom malware aligns with the TTPs of ENVYSCOUT and other APT groups, making it a plausible sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
