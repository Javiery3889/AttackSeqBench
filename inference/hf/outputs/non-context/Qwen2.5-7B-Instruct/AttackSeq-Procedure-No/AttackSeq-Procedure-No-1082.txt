To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Initiating Execution**: The question states that the Poison Ivy server is delivered as mobile code via social engineering methods. This is a common initial attack vector where the attacker uses social engineering to trick the victim into executing malicious code.

2. **Command and Control (C2) Communications**: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use Google Drive for C2 communications with the attacker's client. This involves the malware establishing a communication channel with the attacker to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - Poison Ivy is a known piece of malware that can use various methods for C2 communications, including HTTP, HTTPS, and other web-based services. While it is not a common method, using Google Drive for C2 communications is technically feasible. However, it is not the most typical or efficient method for C2 communications due to the limitations and potential detection risks associated with using cloud storage services for this purpose.

- **B: No**
  - This choice suggests that using Google Drive for C2 communications is unlikely. While it is true that Poison Ivy typically uses more direct and less detectable methods for C2 communications, the question does not provide enough context to definitively rule out the use of Google Drive. However, given the nature of Poison Ivy and the common methods it employs, this choice seems more plausible.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Poison Ivy is known to use various C2 methods, but not typically Google Drive.
2. Using Google Drive for C2 could be a method, but it is not the most common or efficient.
3. The question does not provide additional context that would make the use of Google Drive more likely.

**Final Answer: B: No**
