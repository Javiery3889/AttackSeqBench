To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Persistence**: FIN13 uses passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE to establish a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution. This step ensures that the attacker can maintain a persistent presence on the target system.

2. **Further Access**: The question then asks if it is likely that FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence.

3. **Persistence Methods**: The question mentions that FIN13 also uses tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries to establish persistence. This indicates that persistence is already established through these methods.

4. **Initial Access vs. Persistence**: Deploying web shells and custom malware for initial access is typically a step that occurs before or during the initial compromise, not after persistence has been established. Once persistence is in place, the focus shifts to maintaining control and potentially expanding the attack surface, rather than needing to repeatedly gain initial access.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FIN13 would not deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access after persistence has been established. Instead, these would be used for maintaining control and furthering the attack.

**Final Answer: B**
