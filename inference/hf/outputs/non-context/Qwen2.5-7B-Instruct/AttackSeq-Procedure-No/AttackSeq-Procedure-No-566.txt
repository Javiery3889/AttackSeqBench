To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two TTPs:
     - T1195: Supply Chain Compromise, which involves using a compromised software update as an initial access vector.
     - The question also asks if it is likely that the attackers leveraged legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before or after T1195.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the attackers used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before or during the supply chain compromise. This could be a plausible step as it would allow the attackers to establish a foothold and potentially control the compromised system before or during the initial access vector.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers did not use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. This would mean they either used stolen credentials, brute-forced access, or another method to gain access.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) is a method where attackers compromise a software update to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Step 2:** Before or during this compromise, attackers might need to establish a foothold or gain additional access to the network.
   - **Step 3:** Using legitimate credentials to log into external remote services is a common method to establish a foothold and gain additional access, as it can provide a legitimate-looking entry point and avoid detection.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the nature of T1195, where attackers are likely to be cautious and use methods that avoid immediate detection, using legitimate credentials to log into external remote services is a plausible step to establish a foothold.

**Final Answer: A**
