To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **System Information Gathering**: The malware uses the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to gather system information and sends it to an IP address '45.124.132.127'. This is a common initial step in many malware operations to gather information about the target system.

2. **Data Encryption**: The question then asks if the malware will encrypt C2 (Command and Control) data. While encryption is a common practice to protect data in transit, it is not necessarily a requirement for all malware operations. Some malware might not encrypt C2 data, especially if the data is not sensitive or if the malware uses other methods to obfuscate the data.

3. **Data Conversion**: The malware then converts the C2 data into a hexadecimal representation. This step is not a standard practice in typical malware operations. Hexadecimal conversion is more common in data processing or storage, but not typically a step in C2 data transmission.

4. **Base64 Encoding**: After converting the data to hexadecimal, the malware encodes it into base64. Base64 encoding is often used to encode binary data into a text format that can be transmitted over protocols that do not support binary data. However, the combination of hexadecimal conversion followed by base64 encoding is not a standard practice and seems redundant.

5. **Domain Contact**: Finally, the malware contacts the domain 'marina-info.net' for further operations. This is a common TTP where malware communicates with a C2 server to receive further instructions.

Given the steps described, the sequence of TTPs (encryption, hexadecimal conversion, base64 encoding) is not a standard or common practice in typical malware operations. While some malware might use encryption and base64 encoding, the combination of hexadecimal conversion followed by base64 encoding is not a standard practice.

**Final Answer: B: No**
