To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Attackers use PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement across the compromised network.**
   - PsExec and WinExe are tools used for remote execution and control, often employed in post-exploitation stages to move laterally within a network.

2. **Attackers map the network and collect passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz.**
   - Nmap is used for network scanning and mapping, while Mimikatz is used for credential harvesting. These actions are typically performed after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold.

3. **Attackers use spearphishing emails to execute GreyEnergy mini.**
   - GreyEnergy is a malware family often used in targeted attacks. Spearphishing is a common method to deliver such malware.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

**A: Yes**
- This implies that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. The attackers would first use spearphishing to deliver GreyEnergy, then use PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, followed by network mapping and credential harvesting with Nmap and Mimikatz.

**B: No**
- This would imply that the sequence is not plausible, which would mean that the steps described do not logically follow each other in the context of an attack.

Given the logical flow of an attack, where spearphishing is used to gain initial access, followed by lateral movement, network mapping, and credential harvesting, the sequence described in the question is plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
