To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - The campaign involves phishing emails.
   - The emails contain a malicious Microsoft Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
   - The document is expected to execute VBS (Visual Basic Script) macros.
   - The goal is to gain initial access to the target system.

2. **TTP Sequence:**
   - **Phishing Email:** The initial step is sending a phishing email to the target.
   - **Malicious Document:** The email contains a document that is designed to trick the user into opening it.
   - **Execution of VBS Macros:** Once the document is opened, the VBS macros are executed, which is a common technique to automate actions and potentially download or run malicious code.

3. **Answer Choices Evaluation:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs (phishing email, opening the document, and executing VBS macros) is likely to occur in the described campaign.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is unlikely to occur in the described campaign.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Phishing emails are a common initial attack vector.
   - Embedding malicious documents in emails is a well-known tactic to trick users into executing harmful code.
   - Executing VBS macros from a Word document is a common method to automate the execution of malicious scripts or to download additional malware.

Given the commonality and effectiveness of these TTPs in phishing campaigns, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
