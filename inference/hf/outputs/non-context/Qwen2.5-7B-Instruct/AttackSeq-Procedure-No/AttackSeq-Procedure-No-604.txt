To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the attack sequence described in the question.

1. **Gaining Execution through Delphi Downloader**: The question mentions that the attack starts with a Delphi downloader that uses Windows API to execute commands and sends system information to the C&C server. This is a known tactic used by various threat actors, including the Sednit group.

2. **System Information Gathering**: The Delphi downloader is described as sending system information to the C&C server. This is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks to gather intelligence about the target environment.

3. **Next Step in the Sequence**: The question asks if the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader will perform system service discovery to obtain information about services on the victim's machine. The AutoIt downloader is a different tool than the Delphi downloader mentioned initially. However, the Sednit group is known for using various tools and techniques to achieve their objectives.

4. **Analysis of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This suggests that after the initial Delphi downloader, the AutoIt downloader will perform system service discovery. While the Sednit group is known for using multiple tools, there is no specific evidence in the provided information that directly links the AutoIt downloader to performing system service discovery immediately after the Delphi downloader.
   - **B: No**: This suggests that the AutoIt downloader will not perform system service discovery. Given the lack of specific information linking the AutoIt downloader to this particular step, and considering the typical behavior of the Sednit group, it is plausible that the AutoIt downloader might perform other actions or might not perform this specific step immediately.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the typical behavior of the Sednit group, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not explicitly indicate that the AutoIt downloader will perform system service discovery immediately after the Delphi downloader.

Final Answer: B: No
