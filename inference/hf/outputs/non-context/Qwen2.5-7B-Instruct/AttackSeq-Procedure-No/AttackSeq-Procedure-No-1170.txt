Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Initial Access:** The actors exploited vulnerabilities in malicious RTF and Excel files to gain initial access.
   - **Encryption of C2 Traffic:** The question asks if it is likely that they would use OpenSSL to encrypt C2 (Command and Control) traffic.
   - **Payload Delivery:** The Andromeda Trojan is mentioned as delivering payloads from C2 servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the actors would use OpenSSL to encrypt C2 traffic.
     - Using OpenSSL for encryption is a common practice in cyber-attacks to obfuscate C2 traffic and evade detection.
     - The use of OpenSSL aligns with typical tactics used by sophisticated actors to secure their communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the actors would not use OpenSSL to encrypt C2 traffic.
     - This would be less likely because encryption is a standard practice to protect C2 communications, and not using it would make the traffic more detectable.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The actors have already gained initial access through a known vulnerability in RTF and Excel files.
   - To maintain stealth and avoid detection, it is highly likely that they would use encryption for their C2 communications.
   - OpenSSL is a widely used and trusted encryption tool, making it a plausible choice for securing C2 traffic.
   - The use of OpenSSL would help in evading network monitoring and analysis, which is a common requirement for sophisticated actors like ProjectM.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
