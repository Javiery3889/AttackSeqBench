To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of the GreyEnergy group's known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

1. **Compromise with GreyEnergy mini**: This is the initial step where the attackers use a specific malware or exploit to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Use Nmap and Mimikatz**: These are reconnaissance and privilege escalation tools. Nmap is used for network scanning, and Mimikatz is used for credential dumping, which are common in post-exploitation phases.

3. **Move AvosLocker and tools across the network**: This is the final step where the attackers deploy malware (AvosLocker) and other tools to spread across the network.

4. **Use PDQ Deploy**: PDQ Deploy is a software deployment tool. It is primarily used for managing and deploying software across a network, but it is not typically associated with the deployment of malware like AvosLocker.

Given the context of the GreyEnergy group, which is known for using custom malware and leveraging various post-exploitation tools, the use of PDQ Deploy for deploying malware like AvosLocker is not a typical or plausible TTP. The GreyEnergy group is more likely to use custom scripts, tools, or other malware to spread across the network rather than a legitimate software deployment tool.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The GreyEnergy group is known for using custom malware and tools for post-exploitation activities.
2. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool and is not typically used by cybercriminals for deploying malware.
3. The GreyEnergy group would more likely use custom scripts or other malware to spread across the network.

**Final Answer: No (B)**
