Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Exploiting Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199.
   - Persistence: Scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.
   - Execution: Using `mshta.exe` to execute an embedded .hta file.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This implies that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
     - The initial access is achieved through a known exploit (CVE-2017-0199) via a Microsoft Word document.
     - The persistence mechanism is established by scheduling a task to run a VBS file.
     - The execution of the .hta file is done using `mshta.exe`, which is a common method to execute .hta files in a less suspicious manner.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.
     - However, the steps described are all plausible and commonly seen in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of a known exploit (CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access through a Microsoft Word document is a well-documented method.
   - Scheduling a task to run a VBS file for persistence is a common technique to ensure the malware remains active.
   - Executing a .hta file using `mshta.exe` is a stealthy method to run malicious code without the user's knowledge.

Given the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with typical APT behavior.

**Final Answer: Yes**
