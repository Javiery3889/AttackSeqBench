Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where APT-TOCS (a known APT group) uses PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for command and control (C2) operations. The question then asks if it is likely for APT-TOCS to exhibit lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - APT groups often use various methods to maintain persistence and move laterally within a network. Lateral movement is a common tactic used by APTs to spread and establish a foothold in different parts of the network. Using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for C2 operations is a sophisticated method to maintain stealth and control over the compromised system. It is reasonable to assume that after establishing a foothold, APT-TOCS would likely attempt to move laterally to other systems within the network to expand their control and access.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that APT-TOCS would not exhibit lateral movement after using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for C2 operations. However, this is less likely given the nature of APT operations, which typically involve extensive lateral movement to maintain access and gather intelligence.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- APT groups like APT-TOCS are known for their sophisticated and persistent methods of operation.
- Using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for C2 operations indicates a high level of sophistication and stealth.
- The primary goal of APTs is often to maintain long-term access and gather intelligence, which typically requires moving laterally within the network to different systems and resources.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that APT-TOCS would exhibit lateral movement after establishing a foothold through the use of PowerShell scripts.

Final Answer: A
