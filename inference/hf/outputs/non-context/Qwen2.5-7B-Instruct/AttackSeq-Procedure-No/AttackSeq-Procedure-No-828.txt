To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs for GreyEnergy, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: GreyEnergy uses spearphishing emails and compromising public-facing web servers to gain initial access.
- **Post-Initial Access**: The question asks if GreyEnergy is likely to inject shellcode into svchost.exe and run some modules filelessly in memory to hinder analysis and detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **GreyEnergy's Known TTPs**: GreyEnergy is known for using a variety of techniques, including spearphishing, compromising web servers, and fileless malware techniques. Fileless malware techniques often involve injecting code into legitimate processes like svchost.exe to evade detection.
- **Injecting Shellcode into svchost.exe**: This is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to hide their malicious activities. By injecting shellcode into svchost.exe, the malware can blend in with legitimate system processes, making it harder to detect.
- **Running Modules Filelessly in Memory**: GreyEnergy is also known for its use of fileless techniques, where it runs malicious code directly in memory without writing it to the disk. This further complicates detection by security tools that rely on signature-based detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and compromising web servers, which are common initial access vectors.
2. **Post-Initial Access**: Given GreyEnergy's known techniques, it is highly plausible that they would use fileless techniques to execute their payload.
3. **Injecting Shellcode into svchost.exe**: This is a known technique used by GreyEnergy to hide their activities.
4. **Running Modules Filelessly in Memory**: GreyEnergy is known for its fileless malware techniques, which align with the described behavior.

### Final Answer: A: Yes

The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with GreyEnergy's known behavior, making the answer "Yes" the most plausible choice.
