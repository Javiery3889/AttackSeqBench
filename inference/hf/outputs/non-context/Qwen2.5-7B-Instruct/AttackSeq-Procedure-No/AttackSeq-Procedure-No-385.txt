Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
   - APT15 used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate.
     - Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential dumping, which aligns with the use of RoyalCLI to gain elevated privileges.
     - Stealing a VPN certificate to access the network remotely is a plausible follow-up action after gaining domain administrator credentials.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT15 did not use Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and did not steal a VPN certificate.
     - While it is possible that APT15 did not use these specific tools, the question asks for the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves APT15 gaining elevated privileges using RoyalCLI and then likely performing actions that would provide them with full control over the network.
   - Stealing domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate are common and effective methods for maintaining persistence and access to a network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

Final Answer: A
