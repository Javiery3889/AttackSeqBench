Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by actors in a cyber attack:
     - Discovery of network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems.
     - Downloading a new plugin.
     - Using webshells for lateral movement.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the actors followed this sequence of actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.
     - Discovery commands are common in initial reconnaissance to gather information about the target network.
     - Downloading a new plugin could be a method to bypass security measures or to gain more control over the system.
     - Using webshells for lateral movement is a common technique to move from one system to another within a network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is not plausible.
     - While it is possible that actors might use different methods, the described sequence is a plausible and common sequence in many cyber attacks.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks.
   - Discovery commands are often the first step to understand the target environment.
   - Downloading a new plugin can be a method to evade detection or to gain more control over the system.
   - Using webshells for lateral movement is a well-known technique to move between systems within a network.
   - Given the commonality and logic of this sequence, it is reasonable to conclude that it is a plausible sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
