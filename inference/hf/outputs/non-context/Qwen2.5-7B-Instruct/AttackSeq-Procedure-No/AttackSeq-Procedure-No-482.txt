Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **SparrowDoor:** This is a method used to communicate with the C&C server using HTTPS.
   - **Encrypted Communications:** The communications use multi-byte XOR keys.
   - **Scheduled Transfer:** Data is exfiltrated every 10 minutes.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice assumes that all the mentioned TTPs (SparrowDoor, encrypted communications, and scheduled transfer) are part of the attack sequence.
     - The sequence described in the question aligns with this choice.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice would imply that at least one of the TTPs (SparrowDoor, encrypted communications, or scheduled transfer) is not part of the attack sequence.
     - The question does not provide any information that would suggest any of these TTPs are not part of the attack sequence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question provides a sequence of TTPs that are all described as part of the attack sequence by FamousSparrow.
   - There is no information in the question that would contradict the use of SparrowDoor, encrypted communications, or a scheduled transfer method for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: Yes**
