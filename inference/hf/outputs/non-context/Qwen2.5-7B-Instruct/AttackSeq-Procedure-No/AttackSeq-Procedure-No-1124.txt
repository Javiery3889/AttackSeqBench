To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a spear-phishing email that contains a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access to the system.

2. **Execution of Exploit**: The exploit (show.swf) is executed, which is a Flash file. This file is likely to perform actions to establish a foothold on the system.

3. **Downgrading NTLM**: The question asks if the Flash file will "downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes." This implies that the Flash file might attempt to downgrade the network authentication protocol from a more secure method (like Kerberos) to NTLM, which is less secure, to capture the NTLM hashes.

4. **Payload Installation**: After establishing a foothold, the shellcode installs the payload, which is embedded in a GIF image.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This suggests that the Flash file 'show.swf' will indeed downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes. This is a plausible step in an attack sequence where the attacker aims to capture credentials for later use. Downgrading NTLM can be a method to capture NTLM hashes, which can be used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

- **B: No** - This suggests that the Flash file 'show.swf' will not downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes. This is less likely because the question implies that this is a step in the attack sequence.

Given the context and the typical methods used in such attacks, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the Flash file attempting to capture NTLM hashes as part of the attack.

**Final Answer: A**
