To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     1. Evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts.
     2. Downloading additional malware.
   - The question then asks if the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victim’s machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is designed to steal browser cookies from Google Chrome and Apple Safari.
     - The Dropping Elephant backdoor is known for its ability to steal credentials and other sensitive information from various applications, including web browsers. Stealing cookies from browsers like Google Chrome and Safari is a common TTP for this backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is not designed to steal browser cookies from Google Chrome and Apple Safari.
     - Given the Dropping Elephant backdoor's known capabilities, this seems less likely.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Dropping Elephant backdoor is known for its ability to steal credentials and sensitive information from various applications, including web browsers.
   - Stealing cookies from browsers like Google Chrome and Safari is a common TTP for this backdoor.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (evading defenses and downloading additional malware) is consistent with the Dropping Elephant backdoor's known behavior.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the Dropping Elephant backdoor would steal browser cookies from the victim’s machine.

**Final Answer: A**
