Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with email attachments containing documents with malicious VBA macros. This is a common initial access vector for malware.

2. **Execution of First Stage Payload**: The first stage payload is executed, which gathers initial system information using SYSTEMINFO and TASKLIST commands. This is a typical behavior for malware to understand the environment it is in.

3. **Persistence**: The question then asks about the use of an AutoIt downloader to establish persistence through Windows registry entries under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. AutoIt is a scripting language that can be used to create small, portable, and easy-to-use scripts for automating tasks. It is plausible that an attacker might use AutoIt to create a script that adds a registry entry to ensure the malware runs every time the user logs in.

4. **Software Discovery**: After establishing persistence, the malware retrieves a list of installed software on the victim's machine. This is a common step in the malware lifecycle to understand the environment and tailor its actions accordingly.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the typical behavior of malware. Establishing persistence through registry entries and performing software discovery are common tactics used by malware to ensure long-term access and to understand the victim's environment.

- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely, which does not align with the common practices of malware.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed likely to occur as outlined in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
