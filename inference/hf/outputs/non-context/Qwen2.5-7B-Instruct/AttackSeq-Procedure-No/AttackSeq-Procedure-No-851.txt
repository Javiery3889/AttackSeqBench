To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader**: This is a piece of malware that is known for obfuscating its files or information to evade detection. This is a common tactic used by malware to avoid being identified by security software.

2. **Persistence**: The question asks if Dexphot (a hypothetical or known malware) is likely to ensure persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks. Persistence is a critical TTP for malware to maintain access to a system over time.

3. **Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution**: These are specific techniques used to ensure persistence. Scheduled Task involves creating a scheduled task to run the malware at regular intervals, while Signed Binary Proxy Execution involves using a legitimate signed binary to execute the malware, which can bypass some security measures.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This suggests that Dexphot would use both dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks to ensure persistence. However, dual monitoring services are not a common or typical persistence technique. Scheduled tasks are a well-known method for persistence, but the addition of dual monitoring services seems redundant and not a standard practice.

- **B: No**: This suggests that Dexphot would not use dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks for persistence. Given that scheduled tasks are a common and effective method for persistence, and dual monitoring services are not a standard persistence technique, this answer seems more plausible.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. **Obfuscation**: The use of SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader for obfuscation is a common tactic.
2. **Persistence**: Ensuring persistence is crucial for malware to maintain access.
3. **Techniques**: Scheduled Task is a well-known and effective method for persistence. Dual monitoring services are not a standard persistence technique.

**Final Answer: B: No**
