Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Initial Access**: LYCEUM gains initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
2. **Delivery of Malware**: DanBot malware is delivered via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
3. **Execution of Commands**: The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would utilize DanBot for execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.
4. **Deployment of Obfuscated Macro Tool**: After executing arbitrary commands, the question suggests deploying an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware.

### Analysis of Answer Choices

**A: Yes**
- **Reasoning**: This answer aligns with a common tactic in cyber attacks where initial malware (DanBot) is used to gain a foothold and then more sophisticated tools (like DanDrop) are deployed to achieve the ultimate goal. The use of `cmd.exe` for execution of arbitrary commands is a standard method to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system. Deploying an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware is a plausible next step to ensure the malware remains undetected and continues to operate.

**B: No**
- **Reasoning**: This answer does not align with typical attack sequences. If DanBot is already present and capable of executing commands, there is no need to deploy another tool to drop the same malware. The deployment of DanDrop would be redundant and does not follow a logical sequence of attack tactics.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
