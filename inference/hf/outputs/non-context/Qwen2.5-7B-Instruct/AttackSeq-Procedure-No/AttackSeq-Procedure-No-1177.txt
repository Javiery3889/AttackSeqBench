To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Downloading Additional Components**: FoggyWeb is known to download additional components from a C2 server. This is a common TTP in many malware families, including FoggyWeb.

2. **Passively Monitoring HTTP Requests**: FoggyWeb is known to monitor HTTP traffic, particularly for specific patterns defined by the attacker. This is a key TTP of FoggyWeb.

3. **Exfiltrating Configuration Database**: FoggyWeb is known to exfiltrate the configuration database, which contains important information for the malware's operation.

4. **Exfiltrating Decrypted Certificates**: FoggyWeb is also known to exfiltrate decrypted token-signing and token-decryption certificates, which are used for further operations and evasion.

5. **Monitoring After Exfiltration**: The question asks if FoggyWeb is likely to passively monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns only after exfiltrating the necessary data.

Given the known behavior of FoggyWeb, it is plausible that the malware would perform these actions in the described sequence. FoggyWeb typically performs these actions in a specific order: downloading components, exfiltrating data, and then monitoring traffic for specific patterns.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes** - This aligns with the known behavior of FoggyWeb, where it first exfiltrates necessary data and then monitors traffic for specific patterns.
- **B: No** - This would imply that FoggyWeb does not follow this sequence, which contradicts the known behavior of the malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
