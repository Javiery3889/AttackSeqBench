To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step:

1. **Data Exfiltration**: The question mentions that data is exfiltrated over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools. This is a common method used by advanced threat actors to transfer data out of a network.

2. **Data Collection**: The attack sequence specifies that sensitive data is collected from network shared drives. This indicates that the threat actor has already gained access to the network and is in the process of gathering information.

3. **Local/Remote Archiving**: The data is then archived locally or remotely using utilities and libraries. This step suggests that the threat actor is preparing the data for exfiltration or further analysis.

4. **Proxy Usage**: The question asks if FIN13 (a known APT group) is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control only after collecting sensitive data and archiving it. Proxies are often used to mask the origin of the data exfiltration and to avoid detection by network security measures.

Given the sequence of TTPs and the nature of FIN13's known tactics, it is reasonable to assume that they would use proxies to further obfuscate their activities and maintain persistence in the network. The use of proxies is a common tactic employed by APT groups to avoid detection and maintain operational security.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- Data exfiltration is a common method used by threat actors.
- Data collection from network shared drives is a typical step in an APT lifecycle.
- Archiving the data locally or remotely is a preparatory step for exfiltration.
- FIN13, as a known APT group, is likely to use proxies to mask their activities and maintain operational security.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
