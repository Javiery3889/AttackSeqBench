To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial TTPs Described in the Question:**
   - Data collection from SNS application folders and other targeted directories.
   - Processing the collected data into ".a" files.
   - Storing the ".a" files in categorized directories.
   - Exfiltration using either:
     - Staging in the %TEMP% directory and then encrypting the files before exfiltrating them to a C2 server over UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
     - Using Megasync to exfiltrate data to the cloud.

2. **Analysis of Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that WinDealer is likely to use Megasync for exfiltration instead of the described methods.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that WinDealer is not likely to use Megasync for exfiltration and will instead use the described methods.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions that WinDealer is known to use certain methods for exfiltration, such as staging in the %TEMP% directory and then encrypting the files before exfiltrating them to a C2 server over UDP or TCP ports.
   - The question asks if WinDealer is likely to use Megasync for exfiltration instead of these methods. Given that WinDealer is known to use specific methods for exfiltration, it is less likely that it would switch to using Megasync, which is a cloud-based file synchronization service, for exfiltration.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the known TTPs of WinDealer and the specific methods it is known to use for exfiltration, it is less plausible that WinDealer would use Megasync for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
