To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **RIG EK Delivery Method**: RIG EK (Exploit Kit) is known to deliver exploits through malvertising, which involves embedding malicious code in online advertisements. This is a common method for delivering exploits to unsuspecting users.

2. **Malvertising**: Malvertising involves redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites. This is a well-documented method used by exploit kits to deliver malicious payloads.

3. **Obfuscated PowerShell Script**: The question mentions an obfuscated PowerShell script that is used to fetch malware. PowerShell scripts can be used to execute commands and download additional malware, and obfuscation is a common technique to evade detection by security software.

4. **Command and Scripting Interpreter**: PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language from Microsoft, which can be used to execute commands and scripts. The term "Command and Scripting Interpreter" in this context likely refers to PowerShell.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. RIG EK can indeed use malvertising to redirect users to compromised websites, and an obfuscated PowerShell script can be used to fetch and execute malware.
- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the described sequence of TTPs is not plausible, which contradicts the known methods and techniques of RIG EK.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed accurate.

Final Answer: A
