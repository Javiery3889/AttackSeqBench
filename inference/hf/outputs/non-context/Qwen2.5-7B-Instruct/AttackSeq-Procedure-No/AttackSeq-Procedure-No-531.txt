Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Iterating through password stores.
     2. Stealing the user's Google Chrome credentials.
     3. Dropping a backdoor (Elephant backdoor).
     4. Decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts.
     5. Downloading additional malware.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Elephant backdoor will indeed decode encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.
     - This aligns with the TTPs described, as it involves a sophisticated method of evading detection by using encoded scripts to execute malicious actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Elephant backdoor will not use this method to evade defenses.
     - This does not align with the TTPs described, as it contradicts the sequence of actions that involve decoding and downloading additional malware.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that involve advanced evasion techniques, such as decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts.
   - The Elephant backdoor is known for its sophisticated methods of evading detection, which often include using encoded scripts to execute malicious actions.
   - The described sequence of TTPs is consistent with the known behavior of advanced malware and backdoors.

**Final Answer: A**
