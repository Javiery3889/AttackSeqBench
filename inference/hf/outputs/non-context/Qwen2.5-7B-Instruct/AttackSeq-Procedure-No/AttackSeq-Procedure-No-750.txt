To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the given information and the proposed actions step-by-step.

1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The Rising Sun implant has already performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details. This is a common first step in many cyber attacks to gather information about the target environment.

2. **Communication with Control Servers**: The implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests that are encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding. This indicates that the implant is designed to maintain stealth and confidentiality in its communications.

3. **Data Exfiltration Method**: The question asks if it is likely that the implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration. GitHub is a widely used platform for version control and collaboration, and it is not typically used for data exfiltration due to its public nature and the ease with which such activities can be detected and monitored.

Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: Using GitHub for data exfiltration would be highly unusual and risky. GitHub is a public platform, and any data exfiltrated through it would be visible to anyone with access to the repository. This would likely trigger alerts and investigations, making it a poor choice for an implant that is designed to maintain stealth and confidentiality.

- **B: No**: This is the more plausible option. Given the nature of GitHub as a public platform, it is unlikely that the Rising Sun implant would use it for data exfiltration. Instead, the implant would likely use more covert methods to exfiltrate data, such as leveraging legitimate-looking file uploads or using other less traceable communication channels.

**Final Answer: B: No**
