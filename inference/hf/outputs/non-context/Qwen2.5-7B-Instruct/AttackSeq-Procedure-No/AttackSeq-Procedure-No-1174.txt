Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Exploiting a Vulnerability**: The question mentions exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) via email attachments. This is a common initial step in many malware campaigns, where the attacker uses a known vulnerability to deliver malware.

2. **Dropping the Taidoor Malware**: After the initial exploitation, the malware (Taidoor) is dropped. This is a typical behavior where the malware is delivered to the system for further malicious activities.

3. **Opening a Decoy Document**: The malware opens a decoy document, which is often used to establish a foothold and to avoid immediate detection by the user or security systems.

4. **Anti-Sandboxing and Anti-Virtualization Checks**: These are common behaviors for malware to ensure it is running in a real environment and not in a sandbox or virtualized environment. This is crucial for the malware to execute its payload without being detected or analyzed.

5. **Communicating with CnC Servers**: The malware communicates with its Command and Control (CnC) servers (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw) using a modified traffic pattern. This is a standard method for malware to maintain persistence and receive further instructions.

Given the above points, it is highly plausible that Taidoor would perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers. These checks are essential for the malware to ensure it is operating in a real environment and to avoid detection by security tools.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
