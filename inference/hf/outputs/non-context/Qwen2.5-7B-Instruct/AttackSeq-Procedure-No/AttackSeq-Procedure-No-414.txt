Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The question mentions that UNC1945 uses custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation during the Discovery phase. This is a plausible and common TTP for initial reconnaissance.

2. **OAuth Access Token Abuse**: The question then asks if UNC1945 will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts. This is a specific and targeted TTP that involves leveraging OAuth for unauthorized access, which is a sophisticated method often used by advanced threat actors.

3. **Lateral Movement via RDP**: Finally, the question states that UNC1945 will move laterally to a Windows server via RDP in the Lateral Movement phase. This is a common method for moving laterally within a network, especially in the context of a Windows environment.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It includes the use of custom virtual machines for reconnaissance, the abuse of OAuth access tokens for gaining access to email accounts, and the use of RDP for lateral movement. This sequence is plausible and follows a logical progression of attack phases.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. If the answer were "No," it would imply that UNC1945 does not use OAuth access tokens for gaining access to email accounts or does not move laterally via RDP, which does not align with the detailed sequence provided in the question.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best answered with "Yes."

Final Answer: A
