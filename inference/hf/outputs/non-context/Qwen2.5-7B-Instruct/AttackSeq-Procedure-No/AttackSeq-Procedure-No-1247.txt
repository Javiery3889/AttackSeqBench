Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that include:
     - Granting debugging privileges by modifying the security token to add `SeDebugPrivilege`.
     - Process injection.
     - Ensuring persistence through a scheduled task set to execute at host boot.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice implies that SUNSPOT (a hypothetical entity) would follow the sequence of TTPs described.
     - The sequence of TTPs described aligns with common malware behavior, where attackers often use debugging privileges to inject code and ensure persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice implies that SUNSPOT would not follow the sequence of TTPs described.
     - This would mean that SUNSPOT would not use debugging privileges, process injection, or scheduled tasks for persistence, which contradicts the typical behavior of malware that aims to evade detection and maintain long-term access.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is a common approach used by malware to gain persistence and evade detection. Granting debugging privileges allows the malware to perform actions that are otherwise restricted, such as injecting code into processes. Ensuring persistence through a scheduled task is a standard method to ensure the malware runs every time the system boots.
   - The use of AES128-CBC encryption for protecting targeted source code files is a separate TTP and does not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the behavior of malware that aims to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: A"
