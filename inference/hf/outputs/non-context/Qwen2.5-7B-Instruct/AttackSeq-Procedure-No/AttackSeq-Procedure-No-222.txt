Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attacker gathers detailed information about the infected host, including system specifications and the presence of monitoring tools.
   - The question then asks if, after this information gathering, the Shellbot is likely to push additional malicious tools to perform specific actions (steal user credentials, move laterally, and destroy data).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Shellbot is known to gather information about the infected system and then deploy additional tools based on the gathered information. The actions mentioned (stealing user credentials, moving laterally, and destroying data) are typical of what a sophisticated malware like Shellbot might do after gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that after gathering the necessary information, Shellbot does not proceed to deploy additional tools for the specified actions. This is less likely given the nature of Shellbot and its known behavior.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Step 1: Shellbot gathers detailed information about the infected host, which is a common first step for many malware to understand the environment.
   - Step 2: Based on this information, Shellbot is likely to deploy additional tools to perform specific actions such as stealing user credentials, moving laterally to other systems, and potentially destroying data.
   - Step 3: The actions described in the question are consistent with the known behavior of Shellbot.

**Final Answer: A**
