To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each step:

1. **System Information Discovery**: This TTP involves gathering information about the target system, such as system configurations, installed software, and network details. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Screen Capture**: This TTP involves capturing images or videos of the target's screen to gather sensitive information, such as passwords, documents, or other confidential data. This is another common technique used to collect valuable data from the target system.

3. **Communication with C2 Server**: The question specifically mentions that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server. The Milestone backdoor is known to establish a connection with a Command and Control (C2) server to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data. This is a typical behavior of backdoors, which are designed to maintain persistence and facilitate further attacks.

4. **Non-standard Port Communication**: The question asks if the communication with the C2 server will occur over a non-standard port. Backdoors often use non-standard ports to avoid detection by network security measures that monitor common ports. This is a common tactic to evade network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls.

5. **Data Exfiltration**: The question also mentions that data will be exfiltrated through the same C2 channel. This is a standard practice for backdoors, as it ensures that the data is sent to the attacker's server in a secure and controlled manner.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the typical behavior of backdoors like the Milestone backdoor. It is common for such backdoors to use non-standard ports for communication and to exfiltrate data through the same channel to maintain stealth and efficiency.

- **B: No**: This choice does not align with the typical behavior of backdoors. If the backdoor were to use a standard port and a different channel for data exfiltration, it would be more easily detected and less effective.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best represented by answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
