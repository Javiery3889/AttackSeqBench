To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP: Trojans KeePass Binaries**
   - The question states that FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation. This is a known tactic used by threat actors to capture credentials.

2. **Next TTP: Obtain Credential Information from /etc/shadow**
   - The question then asks if FIN13 is likely to obtain credential information from /etc/shadow using the shadow.py module. This is another known tactic where threat actors might use a Python script to read sensitive files like /etc/shadow to gather additional credentials.

3. **Subsequent TTP: Leverage Native OS Binaries and Custom Malware**
   - After obtaining credentials, the question suggests that FIN13 would then leverage native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance. This is a common follow-up step where threat actors use the obtained credentials to perform further reconnaissance and gather more information about the network and host.

4. **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It logically follows the initial steps of using trojanized KeePass binaries, then obtaining credentials from /etc/shadow, and finally leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for reconnaissance.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that the steps described in the question do not occur in the order or at all, which is not supported by the information provided.

**Final Answer: A**
