To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the behavior of the malware families SunBird and Hornbill.

1. **Data Collection**: The question mentions that data is collected from SQLite databases. This is a common TTP for data exfiltration, where malware gathers sensitive information from the victim's system.

2. **Data Compression and Storage**: The data is then compressed into ZIP files and stored in hidden folders on external storage. This is another typical TTP where malware compresses data to reduce its size and stores it in a hidden location to avoid detection.

3. **Exfiltration**: The question asks if the data will be exfiltrated over C2 channels to command and control (C2) servers. This is a critical step in the malware lifecycle, where the collected data is sent back to the attacker's server for further analysis or use.

4. **C2 Infrastructure Utilization**: The question also mentions that the C2 infrastructure is used to store or expose the exfiltrated data. This implies that the C2 server is not just a conduit for data transfer but also a place where the data is stored or made available to the attacker.

Given the above points, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the typical behavior of advanced malware like SunBird and Hornbill. They often use C2 infrastructure not just for exfiltration but also for storing or exposing the data. This ensures that the data is available to the attackers even if the initial exfiltration attempt is detected and blocked.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the C2 infrastructure is only used for exfiltration and not for storing or exposing the data. This is less likely because C2 infrastructure is often more robust and versatile, providing multiple functions beyond just data exfiltration.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Data collection and compression are standard TTPs for malware.
2. Storing data in hidden folders on external storage is a common method to avoid detection.
3. Exfiltration over C2 channels is a typical TTP for data transfer.
4. Utilizing the C2 infrastructure for storing or exposing the data is a more advanced and robust approach, which aligns with the behavior of sophisticated malware like SunBird and Hornbill.

**Final Answer: Yes**
