Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The question mentions Waterbear's backdoor, which has been configured with an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address.
   - The backdoor communicates with external entities using these encrypted details.

2. **Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described includes:
     1. Configuration of the backdoor with encryption/decryption key.
     2. XOR-encryption of the C&C server address.
     3. Communication with the C&C server using the encrypted details.

3. **Evasion Technique:**
   - The question asks if API hooking techniques, specifically modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' functions, are likely to be used to evade detection.

4. **Analysis of Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - API hooking is a common technique used by malware to intercept and modify system calls, which can help in evading detection by hiding or altering the behavior of the backdoor.
     - Modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' could help in hiding the backdoor process or altering network traffic to make it appear normal.
   - **B: No**
     - This would imply that API hooking is not a likely technique for this specific sequence of TTPs. However, given the nature of the backdoor and the need to evade detection, API hooking is a plausible technique.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that API hooking is a well-known technique for evading detection and the need to hide the backdoor's activities, it is reasonable to assume that such techniques would be employed.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
