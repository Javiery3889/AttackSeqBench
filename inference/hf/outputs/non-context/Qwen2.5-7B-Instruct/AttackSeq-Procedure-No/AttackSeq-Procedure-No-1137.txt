To answer this question, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of the TTPs mentioned in the context of WINDSHIFT APT's known tactics.

1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The question mentions that WINDSHIFT APT uses social media platforms for long-term monitoring via benign emails and tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com. This is consistent with the known TTPs of WINDSHIFT APT, which often employ social engineering and reconnaissance to gather information.

2. **Email Mimicking Legit Password Recovery Pages**: WINDSHIFT APT is known for using sophisticated phishing techniques, including mimicking legitimate password recovery pages. This tactic is a common method for credential harvesting and aligns with their known TTPs.

3. **SMS to Redirect to Credential Harvesting Landing Pages**: WINDSHIFT APT has also been observed using SMS-based phishing attacks to redirect victims to landing pages where credentials are harvested. This is another known tactic of the group.

4. **HTTPS with Free SSL Certificates**: WINDSHIFT APT is known to use HTTPS to make their phishing pages appear more legitimate. The use of free SSL certificates is a common practice to avoid detection by security tools that look for unencrypted traffic.

Given the above points, it is highly plausible that WINDSHIFT APT would employ these TTPs during the Reconnaissance phase and beyond, as they are consistent with the group's known methods.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
