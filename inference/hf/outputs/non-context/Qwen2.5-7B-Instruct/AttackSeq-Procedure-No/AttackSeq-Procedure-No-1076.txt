To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that Tropic Trooper exploited either CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to gain initial access. Both vulnerabilities are related to Microsoft Office, with CVE-2017-11882 being a use-after-free vulnerability and CVE-2018-0802 being a remote code execution vulnerability. These vulnerabilities are typically used to gain initial access to a system.

2. **Social Media Spearphishing**: The question then asks if it is likely that various social media channels were used to spearphish victims. This step is not directly related to the initial exploitation of the vulnerabilities but could be a separate phase of the attack, possibly to gather additional information or to deliver a payload to a broader audience.

3. **System Configuration File**: The question mentions that a system configuration file drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe). This suggests a post-exploitation phase where the attacker uses a file to install a backdoor on the compromised system.

4. **Sequence Evaluation**:
   - **Answer A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the social media spearphishing is a likely step in the attack sequence. However, the question does not provide any direct evidence that social media was used for spearphishing. The initial access is through a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, and the subsequent steps are about dropping a backdoor installer. There is no information provided that links social media to the spearphishing activity.
   - **Answer B: No** - This choice suggests that social media was not used for spearphishing. Given the lack of information linking social media to the spearphishing activity, this answer is more plausible.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The initial access is through a Microsoft Office vulnerability.
2. There is no information provided about social media being used for spearphishing.
3. The attack sequence focuses on exploiting the vulnerability and dropping a backdoor installer.
4. The question does not provide evidence to support the use of social media for spearphishing.

**Final Answer: B**
