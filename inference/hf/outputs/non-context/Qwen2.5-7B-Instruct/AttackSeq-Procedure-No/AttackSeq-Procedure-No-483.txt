Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions several TTPs:
     - Running `cmd.exe` commands to execute SparrowDoor.
     - Communicating with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.
     - Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the initial access to the system was achieved by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
     - Given that the TTPs mentioned include running commands to execute SparrowDoor and establishing a C&C channel, it is plausible that the initial access was indeed through exploiting vulnerabilities, as this is a common method for gaining initial access in many cyber-attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the initial access was not achieved through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
     - This would imply that the initial access was achieved through a different method, which is less likely given the context of the TTPs mentioned.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the initial access was indeed achieved through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Final Answer: A
