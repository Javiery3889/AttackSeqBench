Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attack sequence described involves:
     1. Sending a PDF attachment.
     2. The PDF attachment passing through security filters and appearing benign.
     3. Abusing the Windows AutoElevate backdoor.
     4. Bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to elevate privileges.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is plausible.
     - Sending a PDF attachment is a common method for initial compromise, especially if it bypasses security filters.
     - The Windows AutoElevate backdoor is a known method to bypass UAC, which is designed to prevent unauthorized elevation of privileges.
     - This sequence aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, particularly with techniques such as T1136 (Compromise Client via Email) and T1543.003 (Bypass User Account Control).

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not plausible.
     - While it is possible that a PDF attachment could bypass security filters, the use of the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass UAC is less common and more specific.
     - The AutoElevate backdoor is a specific and less common technique, and its use in conjunction with a benign PDF attachment is not a typical attack sequence.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The described sequence involves a common initial attack vector (PDF attachment) that bypasses security filters, followed by a specific and less common technique (AutoElevate backdoor) to bypass UAC.
   - This sequence is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.

**Final Answer: A**
