Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The initial access was gained through misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of the organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers will gather detailed information about the organization's supply chain relationships.
     - Gaining detailed knowledge of the supply chain can help the attackers identify potential vulnerabilities or targets within the supply chain, which can be used to deploy malicious containers or other forms of malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not gather detailed information about the organization's supply chain relationships.
     - While it is possible that the attackers might not gather this information, it is less likely given the context of the initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports. The attackers might use the initial access to gather as much information as possible to maximize their chances of success.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports indicates that the attackers have already gained a foothold within the organization.
   - Exploiting such a misconfiguration often suggests that the attackers are looking for ways to establish a persistent presence and gather as much information as possible.
   - Gathering detailed knowledge of the organization's supply chain relationships can provide the attackers with additional targets and vulnerabilities to exploit, which aligns with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that the attackers would gather detailed information about the organization's supply chain relationships to enhance their attack capabilities.

**Final Answer: A**
