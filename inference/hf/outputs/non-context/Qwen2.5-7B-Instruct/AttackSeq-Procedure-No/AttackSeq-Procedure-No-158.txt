Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that APT10 initially sends spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain initial access. This is a common TTP for APT10.

2. **Extracting Wi-Fi Network Names**: The next step mentioned is extracting names of all locally reachable Wi-Fi networks. This is a plausible action as it can help the attackers understand the network environment and plan further actions.

3. **Brute-Force Attack**: The question then mentions performing a brute-force attack to spread to new networks. While this is a possible next step, it is not a typical TTP for APT10. APT10 is known for more sophisticated and stealthy methods of lateral movement.

4. **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure**: The final step is leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure for lateral movement between MSPs and other victims. This is a known TTP for APT10, as they often use the infrastructure of trusted third parties to move laterally within a network.

Given the above analysis, the sequence described in the question does not align perfectly with the known TTPs of APT10. APT10 is more likely to use more sophisticated methods for lateral movement rather than a brute-force attack on Wi-Fi networks.

**Final Answer: No**
