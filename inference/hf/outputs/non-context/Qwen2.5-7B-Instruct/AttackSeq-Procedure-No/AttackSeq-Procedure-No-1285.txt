Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Turla operators:
     1. Updating command and control (C2) servers worldwide.
     2. Using tools stored in an encrypted file system to collect data from local systems.
     3. Gathering system information.
     4. Establishing a hidden foothold in infected networks.
     5. Searching other computers.
     6. Storing stolen information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the question. It suggests that after updating C2 servers, Turla operators would indeed use encrypted tools to collect data, gather system information, establish a hidden foothold, search other computers, and store stolen information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence described in the question. It suggests that Turla operators would not follow the steps outlined in the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question clearly outlines a sequence of actions that Turla operators would take after updating their C2 servers. The sequence includes using encrypted tools to collect data, gathering system information, establishing a hidden foothold, searching other computers, and storing stolen information.
   - Answer Choice A aligns perfectly with this sequence, while Answer Choice B contradicts it.

**Final Answer: A**
