Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - Malicious macro executed from MS Office documents.
   - Downloaded RMS tool and supporting scripts.
   - Likely persistence achieved by using `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` in MS-SQL.
   - Attempt to kill the 'rundll32.exe' process.

2. **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the threat actors will use `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` to achieve persistence and then kill the 'rundll32.exe' process.
     - `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` is a SQL Server command used to create a linked server login, which can be used to establish a connection between SQL Server instances. This TTP is more commonly associated with lateral movement and privilege escalation rather than persistence.
     - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not align well with the typical use of `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` for persistence.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the threat actors will not use `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` to achieve persistence and then kill the 'rundll32.exe' process.
     - While `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` is not a typical persistence mechanism, it is still a valid TTP that can be used in an attack. However, the sequence described in the question does not align well with the use of `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` for persistence.
     - The more plausible sequence would involve a TTP that is commonly used for persistence, such as creating a scheduled task or modifying the registry.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that are not typical for achieving persistence using `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin`. Persistence is more commonly achieved through other methods such as creating scheduled tasks or modifying the registry.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not involve the use of `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` for persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
