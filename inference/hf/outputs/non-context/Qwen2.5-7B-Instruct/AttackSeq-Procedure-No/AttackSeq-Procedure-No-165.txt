Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Staging Exfiltration Data**: The question mentions that data is staged in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools. This is a sophisticated method to hide data exfiltration by using common tools and locations that are less likely to be monitored.

2. **Lateral Movement**: The question then asks if APT10 is likely to leverage shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure for lateral movement. This is a plausible method for APT10, as MSPs often have access to multiple networks and can be used to pivot between them.

3. **Access to New Areas**: The question specifies that the lateral movement is done to gain access to new areas of the network only. This indicates a targeted approach rather than a broad sweep.

4. **Internal Reconnaissance**: After gaining access to new areas, the question states that APT10 will conduct internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools. This is a typical approach for APTs to gather information about the network and systems.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. It suggests that APT10 would use the MSP infrastructure for lateral movement, gain access to new areas, and then conduct reconnaissance using common tools. This sequence is consistent with the described attack pattern.

- **B: No**: This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs. It would imply that APT10 would not use the MSP infrastructure for lateral movement or conduct internal reconnaissance using common tools, which does not align with the described attack pattern.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
