Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The backdoor program has gathered host information during the discovery phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely to use DNS for C2 (Command and Control) communication instead of using DNS tunneling.
   - DNS tunneling involves embedding data within DNS requests and responses, which can be used for C2 communication.
   - The question also mentions a "taskHandler function" which suggests that the backdoor program processes commands from the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Using DNS for C2 communication is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
     - DNS tunneling is a specific method of using DNS for C2 communication, which involves embedding data within DNS requests and responses.
     - The question does not specify that DNS tunneling is being used, only that DNS is being used for C2 communication.
     - DNS can be used for C2 communication without necessarily involving DNS tunneling.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that DNS is not used for C2 communication, which contradicts the premise of the question.
     - The question states that DNS is used for C2 communication, so this answer choice does not align with the information provided.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question states that DNS is used for C2 communication, which is a plausible method for malware to communicate with its C2 server.
   - DNS tunneling is a specific method of using DNS for C2 communication, but the question does not specify that DNS tunneling is being used.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that DNS is used for C2 communication without necessarily involving DNS tunneling.

**Final Answer: A**
