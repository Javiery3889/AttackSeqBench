Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already collected Instagram credentials through phishing sites.
   - The next step in the sequence is to stop specific services related to backups.
   - Finally, the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing the passwords.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This implies that after collecting credentials and before locking out the owners, the attackers will stop specific services related to backups.
     - Stopping backup services could be a tactic to prevent the victims from recovering their data or accounts, which is a plausible step in a multi-stage attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This implies that the attackers will not stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners.
     - This does not align as well with the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, where stopping backup services could be a strategic move to enhance the effectiveness of the lockout.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests a methodical approach to compromising the victims' accounts.
   - Stopping backup services is a logical step to prevent the victims from recovering their data or accounts, which would make the lockout more effective.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners.

**Final Answer: A**
