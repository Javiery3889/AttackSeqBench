To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial Phase (Command and Control):**
   - The question states that a downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware. This indicates that the initial phase involves a downloader and the use of an image file to deliver malware.

2. **Execution Phase:**
   - The question then asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase. This suggests that after the initial delivery of the malware, the next steps involve the use of PowerShell scripts to download additional files.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after the initial delivery of the malware via an image file, PowerShell scripts are used to download a Windows executable and a decoy document. This sequence is plausible because:
    - Malware often uses various techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
    - PowerShell scripts are commonly used for executing malicious activities due to their flexibility and the ability to perform administrative tasks.
    - Downloading additional files (such as a Windows executable and a decoy document) is a common tactic to ensure the malware's persistence and to mislead the user or security systems.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that PowerShell scripts will not be used to download a Windows executable and a decoy document. This is less plausible because:
    - The use of PowerShell scripts for downloading additional files is a well-documented and common tactic in advanced malware campaigns.
    - The question does not provide any information that would suggest this sequence is unlikely.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
