To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial TTP: PowerShell Injection**
   - The question mentions the use of PowerShell injection via the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection module. This is a common technique used by adversaries to execute malicious code in memory without writing it to the disk, thereby evading traditional antivirus solutions.

2. **Network Service Scanning**
   - The question then asks if the CostaRicto Campaign is likely to use tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning. CostaRicto is known for its use of various tools for reconnaissance and network scanning. pscan is a tool used for scanning a range of IP addresses for open ports, and nmap is a widely used tool for network exploration and security auditing. Both tools are consistent with the TTPs of the CostaRicto campaign.

3. **Process Discovery, System Information Discovery, and System Time Discovery**
   - After scanning the network, the next step would be to gather detailed information about the systems, which includes process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery. These actions are typical post-scan activities to understand the target environment better and to identify potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Use of SombRAT Backdoor**
   - The SombRAT backdoor is a known tool used by the CostaRicto campaign for maintaining persistence and performing further actions on the compromised system. It is used for process discovery, system information gathering, and other malicious activities.

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with the known tactics of the CostaRicto campaign. The use of network scanning tools followed by detailed system information gathering and the deployment of a backdoor are consistent with the campaign's modus operandi.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
