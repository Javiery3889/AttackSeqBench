Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an initial attack vector where adversaries use a malicious VBA script to establish a C2 connection. It then asks whether it is likely that the adversaries will follow up with a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - Establishing a C2 connection through a malicious VBA script is a sophisticated initial access technique. Following such an initial breach, adversaries often seek to maintain persistence and escalate privileges. A phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT is a common tactic to achieve these goals. BlackEnergy 3 is known for its ability to perform various malicious activities, including data exfiltration and lateral movement, which aligns with the typical objectives of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that after establishing a C2 connection, the adversaries would not perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT. This is less likely because maintaining a foothold and expanding the attack surface are critical objectives for APTs. A phishing campaign to deliver a RAT is a standard method to achieve these objectives.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial use of a malicious VBA script to establish a C2 connection indicates a sophisticated and targeted approach.
- The BlackEnergy 3 RAT is known for its capabilities in maintaining persistence and performing various malicious activities.
- Phishing campaigns are a common method for delivering malware and expanding the attack surface, which aligns with the objectives of an APT group.
- Given the sophistication of the initial attack and the capabilities of BlackEnergy 3, it is highly plausible that the adversaries would follow up with a phishing campaign to deliver the RAT.

Final Answer: A
