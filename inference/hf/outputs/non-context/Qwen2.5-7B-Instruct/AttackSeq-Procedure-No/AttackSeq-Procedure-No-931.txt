To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the known TTPs of the Darkhotel APT.

1. **Targeting Stored Secrets**: The Darkhotel APT is known for targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services to gain initial access and credentials. This aligns with the first part of the question.

2. **Credential Access**: The APT uses sophisticated methods to access credentials, which is consistent with the described TTP.

3. **Sophisticated Capabilities**: The question mentions signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting data in log files for defense evasion. These are indeed advanced techniques that align with the capabilities of APT groups like Darkhotel.

4. **Deployment of Malware Components**: The sequence in the question suggests that after credential access, the APT deploys malware components such as downloaders, stealers, or advanced keyloggers. This is also consistent with the known TTPs of Darkhotel, which often use a variety of malware to maintain persistence and gather intelligence.

5. **Defense Evasion**: The use of digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypting data in log files for defense evasion are advanced techniques that are likely to be used by sophisticated APT groups like Darkhotel to avoid detection and maintain operational security.

Given the above analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of the Darkhotel APT.

Final Answer: A
