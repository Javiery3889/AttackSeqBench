Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The Aria-body backdoor gathers system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP.
   - **Command and Control (C&C):** The backdoor sends the collected data to a C&C domain using an XORed password.
   - **Persistence:** After the data is sent, the backdoor establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Aria-body backdoor will establish persistence after sending the collected data to the C&C domain.
     - It implies a sequence where the backdoor first gathers information, then sends it, and finally establishes persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Aria-body backdoor will not establish persistence after sending the collected data to the C&C domain.
     - It implies that persistence is established before or independently of sending the data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor is known to gather system information and send it to a C&C server.
   - Establishing persistence is a common tactic used by malware to ensure it remains active on the system.
   - The sequence described in the question (gathering information, sending it, then establishing persistence) is a plausible and common sequence in malware operations.
   - There is no specific information in the question that contradicts the idea of establishing persistence after sending the data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Aria-body backdoor will establish persistence after sending the collected data to the C&C domain.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Final Answer: Yes
