Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors.
   - Distributing via spearphishing links containing malicious files.
   - Injecting additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that after the initial infiltration through firmware backdoors, the malware would use spearphishing as a method to distribute malicious files and then inject additional modules into memory.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It would imply that the malware does not use spearphishing to distribute malicious files or inject additional modules into memory.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a multi-stage attack where the initial compromise is through firmware backdoors, followed by the use of spearphishing to distribute the malware, and then the injection of additional modules into memory.
   - This sequence is a plausible and common approach in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios, where initial access is gained through less detectable means (firmware backdoors), and then the attack is refined and expanded using more traditional but effective methods (spearphishing and in-memory injection).

**Final Answer: A**
