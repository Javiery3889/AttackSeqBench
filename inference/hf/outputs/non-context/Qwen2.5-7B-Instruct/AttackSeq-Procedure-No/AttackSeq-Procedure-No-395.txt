To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's analyze the information provided and compare it with known TTPs of APT41.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing Emails**: The question mentions that APT41 uses spear-phishing emails to gain initial access. This is a well-documented TTP for APT41.

2. **Reconnaissance Activities**: The question asks if APT41 conducts reconnaissance activities such as targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems. 

   - **Call Record Information at Telecom Companies**: APT41 has been known to target telecom companies for call detail records (CDRs) to gather intelligence on their targets. This is a common TTP for APT41.
   - **Hotel Reservation Systems**: While APT41 has been known to target various sectors, there is no specific public information indicating that APT41 has targeted hotel reservation systems as part of their TTPs.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes the initial access via spear-phishing emails followed by reconnaissance activities targeting call record information at telecom companies, which is a known TTP for APT41.

Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
