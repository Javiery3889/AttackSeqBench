To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided information:

1. **Tactic**: Resource Development
   - This tactic involves the attacker developing tools and resources to support their operations, such as implants and malware.

2. **Attackers**: Hidden Cobra
   - Hidden Cobra is a known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group associated with the Iranian government. They are known for their sophisticated cyber-attacks and targeted operations.

3. **TTPs**:
   - **Bankshot implants**: These are custom malware implants developed by the attackers to provide full control over the victim systems.
   - **Wiping files**: The attackers have the capability to delete files from the targeted system.
   - **Spear phishing emails**: The attackers use highly targeted phishing emails to deliver malware.
   - **Malicious Word document**: The spear phishing email contains a malicious Word document.
   - **Exploit CVE-2018-4878**: The document exploits a specific vulnerability to gain initial access.

4. **Target**: Turkish financial organizations
   - Hidden Cobra has a history of targeting specific countries and industries, but there is no known historical evidence of them targeting Turkish financial organizations.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

**A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that Hidden Cobra would target Turkish financial organizations via the described TTPs. However, there is no historical evidence to support this claim. Hidden Cobra's known targets are primarily related to the Middle East and Iran, and there is no indication of them targeting Turkey or its financial sector.

**B: No**
- This choice suggests that Hidden Cobra would not target Turkish financial organizations via the described TTPs. Given the lack of historical evidence and the known targets of Hidden Cobra, this seems to be the more plausible answer.

**Final Answer: B**
