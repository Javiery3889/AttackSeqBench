Step 1: Analyze the Question
- APT28 is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- The question describes a sequence where a malicious document creates a batch file and a registry entry for persistence.
- The question then asks if it is likely to observe the document leveraging DDE via PowerShell to achieve execution by downloading and running encoded commands.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- APT28 is known to use a variety of techniques, including the use of PowerShell and DDE for persistence and command execution.
- DDE is a protocol that allows applications to communicate with each other, and it can be used to execute commands through a crafted document.
- PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment that can be used to download and execute encoded commands, which is a common technique for APTs to maintain stealth and evade detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- APT28 has been observed using DDE in conjunction with PowerShell to execute malicious payloads. This technique allows the attackers to leverage the trust users have in familiar applications and documents.
- The combination of DDE and PowerShell provides a stealthy and flexible method for executing encoded commands, which aligns with APT28's known tactics.
- Given the described persistence mechanism (batch file and registry entry) and the nature of APT28's operations, it is plausible that the document would leverage DDE via PowerShell to achieve execution.

Final Answer: A: Yes
