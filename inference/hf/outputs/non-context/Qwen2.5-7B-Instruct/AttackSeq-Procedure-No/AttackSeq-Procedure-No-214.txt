To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Milestone backdoor ensures persistence**:
   - The backdoor copies itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creates a service named `msupdate2` in the registry. This is a common persistence mechanism used by malware to ensure it remains active even after a system reboot.

2. **Self-generated certificate to the local trust store**:
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher. This step is not typically part of the standard TTPs for a backdoor like Milestone. Typically, malware uses existing trusted certificates or generates them in a way that mimics legitimate certificates to avoid detection.

3. **System information discovery and screen capture functionalities**:
   - After ensuring persistence, the next steps are to gather system information and perform screen captures. These are common functionalities for a backdoor to exfiltrate data and maintain control over the compromised system.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Deep Panda would install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store. However, this is not a typical TTP for a backdoor like Milestone. It would be an unusual and complex step that goes beyond the standard malware behavior.

- **B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Deep Panda would not install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store. This is more plausible because the described TTPs (persistence, system information discovery, and screen capture) are common and do not require such an advanced step.

**Final Answer: B**
