Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving PROMETHIUM malware.
   - PROMETHIUM first searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives during the Collection phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that PROMETHIUM will exfiltrate data every 10 minutes.
     - While PROMETHIUM is known for its data exfiltration capabilities, the frequency of exfiltration (every 10 minutes) is not a standard or typical behavior for this malware. Typically, data exfiltration is done more sporadically to avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that PROMETHIUM will not exfiltrate data every 10 minutes.
     - Given the nature of PROMETHIUM and other similar malware, exfiltration is more likely to be done at irregular intervals to avoid detection by security systems.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - PROMETHIUM is known for its stealth and irregular data exfiltration patterns to avoid detection.
   - Exfiltrating data every 10 minutes is not a typical behavior for this malware, as it would be easily detected by security systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that PROMETHIUM will not exfiltrate data every 10 minutes.

**Final Answer: B**
