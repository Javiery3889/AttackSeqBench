Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes. It then asks if it is likely that the implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after establishing communication, the implant would perform reconnaissance. This is a plausible sequence of TTPs because many malware and implants, once they have established a foothold, will often gather information about the network and system to understand their environment and plan further actions.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the implant does not perform reconnaissance after establishing communication. While it is possible that the implant might not perform reconnaissance, it is less common and less likely for an implant to immediately start exfiltrating data or performing other actions without first gathering information about the target environment.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Rising Sun implant is communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests, which indicates that it has already established a connection and is capable of sending and receiving data.
- It is a common practice for malware and implants to perform reconnaissance to understand the network topology, identify valuable targets, and gather system information before proceeding with more aggressive actions.
- The act of decrypting and collecting network and system information is a form of reconnaissance that would help the implant understand the environment it is operating in, which is crucial for effective command and control operations.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the implant would perform initial reconnaissance after establishing communication.

Final Answer: A
