To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Persistence**: The question mentions that Grandoreiro ensures persistence by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. This is a known TTP for Grandoreiro, as it is designed to maintain a foothold on the compromised system.

2. **Communication with C&C Server**: The question then asks if Grandoreiro is likely to communicate with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP. This is a less common TTP for Grandoreiro, as it is not typically associated with using the RealThinClient SDK for communication. Grandoreiro is known to use other methods for C&C communication, such as DNS tunneling or HTTP/HTTPS requests, but the specific use of RealThinClient SDK is not a documented TTP.

3. **Information Collection**: The question also mentions that Grandoreiro collects information such as usernames during its discovery phase. This is a known TTP for Grandoreiro, as it is designed to gather information from the compromised system to understand the environment and potentially escalate privileges.

Given the above analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of the RealThinClient SDK for C&C communication. Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is:

Final Answer: B: No
