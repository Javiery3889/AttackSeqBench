Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Command-and-Control Infrastructure:** The attackers use C2 infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.
   - **Untrusted and Faked Digital Signatures:** The attackers use untrusted and faked digital signatures for defense evasion.
   - **Disguising Malware:** The attackers disguise executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names.
   - **Execution:** The malware is executed.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This implies that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and follows a logical order.
     - The attackers first establish a C2 infrastructure, then use untrusted and faked digital signatures to evade detection, and finally disguise the malware to make it appear legitimate before executing it.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This implies that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible or does not follow a logical order.
     - It suggests that the steps described do not make sense in the context of an attack sequence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Establishing a C2 infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services is a common first step for attackers to maintain control over their operations.
   - Using untrusted and faked digital signatures is a plausible method for defense evasion, as it can help bypass security measures that rely on trusted digital signatures.
   - Disguising malware with legitimate-looking document names is a common tactic to trick users into executing the malware.
   - Executing the malware is the final step in the sequence.

Given the logical flow and common practices in cyber attacks, the sequence described in the question is plausible.

**Final Answer: Yes**
