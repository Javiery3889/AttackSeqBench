To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Persistence**: The question mentions that the malware ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder. This is a common TTP where malware creates a scheduled task or places itself in the startup folder to ensure it runs every time the system starts.

2. **Discovery Activities**: The question then asks if the malware will collect the MAC address of the infected host as part of its discovery activities. Collecting the MAC address is a form of reconnaissance that can help the malware understand the network environment and potentially identify the specific host it is infecting.

3. **Communication**: Finally, the question states that the malware will communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests. This is a typical method for malware to exfiltrate data or receive commands from the attacker.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will indeed collect the MAC address as part of its discovery activities and then communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests. This sequence aligns with common malware behavior where reconnaissance is conducted before establishing communication with the command and control (C2) servers.

- **B: No** - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant will not collect the MAC address or communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests. This would be less likely given the typical behavior of malware to gather information about the infected host and to communicate with its C2 servers.

Given the typical behavior of malware and the specific TTPs mentioned in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed collect the MAC address and communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

**Final Answer: A**
