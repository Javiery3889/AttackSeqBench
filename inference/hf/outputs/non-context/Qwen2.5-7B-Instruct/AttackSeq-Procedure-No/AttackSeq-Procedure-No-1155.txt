Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already taken the step of changing the original owners' passwords, effectively locking them out of their accounts.
   - The attackers then demand ransom payments for the return of the compromised accounts.
   - After the ransom demand, the attackers are said to collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that after the ransom demand, the attackers proceed to collect credentials through phishing sites.
     - This sequence of actions is plausible because:
       - After gaining control, the attackers might want to ensure they have all the necessary information to maintain control or to extort more money.
       - Phishing sites are a common method to gather sensitive information like login credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers do not collect credentials through phishing sites after the ransom demand.
     - This sequence is less plausible because:
       - It would be unusual for attackers to demand ransom and then not seek to further exploit the situation by collecting more credentials.
       - Phishing is a standard tactic in many cyberattacks to gather additional information.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already taken a significant step by changing the original owners' passwords, which is a common tactic to gain control.
   - They then demand ransom payments, which is a typical extortion tactic.
   - After the ransom demand, it is logical for the attackers to use phishing sites to collect more credentials, as this would help them maintain control or extort more money.
   - The sequence of actions (changing passwords, demanding ransom, and then using phishing) is a well-known pattern in many cyberattacks.

**Final Answer: A**
