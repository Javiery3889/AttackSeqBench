To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Persisting in the System**: The question mentions that APT28 persists in the system using the 'upnphost.exe' executable by setting a registry key. This is a known TTP for APT28, as documented in various CTI reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Gathering System Information**: After persistence, the next step is gathering system information. This is a common TTP for APTs to understand the environment they are in, which helps in tailoring further actions.

3. **Sending to a Server in Hong Kong**: The question specifies that the gathered information is sent to a server located in Hong Kong. This is a plausible step as APTs often use geographically dispersed command and control (C2) servers to evade detection.

4. **Discovery Purpose**: The final step is to determine the purpose of sending the information, which is for Discovery. Discovery is a key phase in the attack lifecycle where the APT gathers information about the target environment to better understand and exploit it.

Given the above analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the typical behavior of APT28, as documented in CTI reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the described sequence of TTPs, as it correctly identifies the persistence method, information gathering, and the purpose of sending the information to a server in Hong Kong for Discovery.
- **B: No** - This choice contradicts the described sequence of TTPs, as it does not align with the known behavior of APT28.

**Final Answer: A**
