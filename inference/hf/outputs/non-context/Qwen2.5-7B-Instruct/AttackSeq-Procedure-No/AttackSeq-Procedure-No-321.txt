To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information provided and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The app uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.
   - After performing routines on the iOS device, the app sends the gathered information via HTTP.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the app performs routines on the iOS device, it sends the gathered information via HTTP. This sequence is plausible because it follows a logical order: first, the app performs necessary routines (which could include gathering information), and then it sends the data via HTTP.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the app does not send the gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device. This is less plausible because it contradicts the sequence described in the question, where the app is explicitly stated to send the information via HTTP after performing routines.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question clearly states that the app performs routines on the iOS device and then sends the gathered information via HTTP.
   - Answer Choice A aligns with this sequence, as it correctly states that the app sends the information via HTTP after performing routines.
   - Answer Choice B contradicts the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: A
