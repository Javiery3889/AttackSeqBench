Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes.
   - The malware then exfiltrated encrypted data to remote servers.
   - The malware used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C2) servers.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after collecting the data (clipboard contents, screenshots, and keystrokes), the malware encrypted the data and exfiltrated it to remote servers before using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with the C2 servers.
     - This sequence is plausible because it follows a logical order: data collection, data encryption, data exfiltration, and then communication with the C2 servers.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware did not exfiltrate encrypted data to remote servers before using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with the C2 servers.
     - This sequence is less plausible because it skips the step of data exfiltration to remote servers, which is a common step in many malware operations to ensure data is securely stored before communicating with the C2 servers.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Choice A, as it includes the logical steps of data collection, data encryption, data exfiltration, and then communication with the C2 servers.

Final Answer: A
