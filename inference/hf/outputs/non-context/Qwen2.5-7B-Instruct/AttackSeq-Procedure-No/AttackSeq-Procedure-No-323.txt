Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a specific method of communication where a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix is used to identify modules while communicating with the Command and Control (C2) server.
   - The question then asks if, during the Discovery phase, the malware is likely to collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The use of a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix is a method of obfuscation and can be used to maintain communication stealth. However, this method of communication does not inherently imply the malware's intent to collect specific types of data.
     - The Discovery phase typically involves gathering information about the target environment to understand the network, systems, and potential vulnerabilities. Collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data are actions that would be more relevant to the later Exploitation or Lateral Movement phases rather than the Discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - While the method of communication described is not directly related to the collection of specific data types, the Discovery phase itself is a critical phase where the malware would gather information about the target environment. It is plausible that during this phase, the malware could collect various types of data, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, as part of its reconnaissance activities.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a method of communication that is not directly tied to the collection of specific data types.
   - The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the target environment, which can include various types of data.
   - While the method of communication does not directly imply the collection of specific data, the Discovery phase itself is a phase where such data collection is likely to occur.

**Final Answer: B: No**
