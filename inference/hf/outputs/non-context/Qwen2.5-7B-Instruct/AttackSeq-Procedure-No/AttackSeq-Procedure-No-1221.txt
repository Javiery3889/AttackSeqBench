Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware (T9000) communicates with a C2 server using an encrypted binary protocol.
   - It captures data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft.
   - It evades detection by customizing its installation to avoid security products.
   - It ensures only one instance runs via mutexes and named events.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. The malware first communicates with a C2 server, then proceeds to capture data, evade detection, and ensure it runs only once.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. If the answer were "No," it would imply that the malware does not follow the described sequence of actions.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a specific sequence of actions that the malware (T9000) is expected to perform.
   - The sequence includes communication with a C2 server, data capture, evasion of detection, and ensuring only one instance runs.
   - Answer Choice A directly supports this sequence, while Answer Choice B contradicts it.

**Final Answer: Yes**
