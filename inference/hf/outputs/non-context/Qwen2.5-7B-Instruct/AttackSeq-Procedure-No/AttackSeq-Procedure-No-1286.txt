Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Establishing a hidden foothold in infected networks.
   - Persistent access to search other computers.
   - Storing stolen information.
   - Setting auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to collect data.
   - Updating command and control servers to maintain control.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Turla operators would indeed set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to collect data and then update command and control servers.
     - This sequence aligns with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors like Turla, who often use email as a means to exfiltrate data and maintain communication with their command and control servers.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Turla operators would not set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to collect data and update command and control servers.
     - This does not align with the typical behavior of Turla, as they are known to use various methods to exfiltrate data and maintain control over infected systems.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Turla, as an APT group, is known for its sophisticated methods of data exfiltration and maintaining control over infected systems. Setting up auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to collect data is a plausible and effective method for them to gather intelligence and maintain communication with their command and control servers.
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Turla.

**Final Answer: A**
