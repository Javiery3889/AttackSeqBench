To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - Steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.
   - Collect system information.
   - Probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.
     - Stealing application access tokens via phishing is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, as it provides the attacker with credentials to gain unauthorized access.
     - Collecting system information and probing files are typical actions during the Discovery phase of an attack, where the attacker gathers information to understand the target environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not plausible.
     - However, the steps described (phishing for credentials, collecting system information, and probing files) are standard and logical steps in an attack sequence.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Phishing for application access tokens is a common initial attack vector, often used to gain unauthorized access to systems.
   - Once access is gained, the attacker would likely want to understand the environment (collecting system information) and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities (probing files).
   - These actions align with the typical behavior of an attacker during the Discovery phase of an attack.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible and common sequence in cyber attacks.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is likely that FamousSparrow will follow this sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: A
