Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Initial Access**: The spyware is placed in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` directory and launches `sysCrt32.exe`. This is a common technique to hide the payload and use a legitimate Windows executable to execute the malicious code.

2. **Execution Method**: The question asks if the spyware will use Windows DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) for execution of commands. DDE is typically used for inter-process communication and is not a common method for executing commands directly. It is more often used for data exchange between applications.

3. **Malicious VBS**: The question also mentions a malicious VBS (Visual Basic Script) being used. While VBS can be used for various malicious activities, it is not directly related to the execution method (DDE) mentioned in the question.

4. **Persistence**: The spyware ensures that the `%PATH%` environment variable includes the `WindowsApps` folder. This is a common persistence technique to ensure the malware can be executed every time the system starts or when certain conditions are met.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This would imply that the spyware uses DDE for command execution, which is not a typical or likely method. The use of DDE for command execution is not a standard or common practice in malware operations.

- **B: No** - This aligns with the typical behavior of malware, where DDE is not used for command execution. Instead, other methods such as registry keys, scheduled tasks, or modifying the `%PATH%` environment variable are more common.

**Final Answer: B**
