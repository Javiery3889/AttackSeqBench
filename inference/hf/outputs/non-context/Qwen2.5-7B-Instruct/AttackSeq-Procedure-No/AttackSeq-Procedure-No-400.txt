Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions the use of a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' for persistence.
   - A mutex named 'woolger' is created to establish defense evasion mechanisms.
   - The question asks if it is likely that GHOLE malware will use legitimate websites such as GitHub or Pastebin through dead drop resolvers to communicate with its C&C servers.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - GHOLE malware is known to use dead drop techniques to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) servers. Dead drops involve using legitimate-looking websites or services as rendezvous points to exchange data. GitHub and Pastebin are legitimate websites that could be used for this purpose.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that GHOLE malware does not use legitimate websites for dead drop communication, which contradicts the known behavior of the malware.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - GHOLE malware is known to use dead drop techniques for communication with its C&C servers.
   - Legitimate websites like GitHub and Pastebin can be used as dead drops because they are not easily detected as malicious.
   - The use of such websites helps in evading detection by security systems that may flag more obvious malicious domains.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
