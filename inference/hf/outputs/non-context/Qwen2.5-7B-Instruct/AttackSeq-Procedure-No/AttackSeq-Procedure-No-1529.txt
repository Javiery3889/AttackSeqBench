To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Understanding the Question:**
   - The attack sequence starts with the contribution to persistence by scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs'.
   - The next step is the management of deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' by 'stopedge.bat'.

2. **Analyzing the TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The scheduling of 'install.vbs' for periodic execution is a common method to maintain persistence on a system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The deletion of files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' can be seen as a tactic to evade detection by security tools that might monitor or analyze these files.

3. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that 'stopedge.bat' is likely to manage the deletion of files as a means of defense evasion. This aligns with the typical behavior of malware to remove traces of its activities and avoid detection.
   - **B: No** - This would imply that 'stopedge.bat' is unlikely to manage the deletion of files, which contradicts the common tactics used by malware to evade detection.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the deletion of files is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection, it is plausible that 'stopedge.bat' would manage the deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as part of its defense evasion strategy.

Final Answer: A
