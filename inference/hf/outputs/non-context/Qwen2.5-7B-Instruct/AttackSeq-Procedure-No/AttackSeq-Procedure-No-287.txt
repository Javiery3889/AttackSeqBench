To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze each part:

1. **Deployment of Malware Tools**: The question mentions the deployment of malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill. These tools are known to be used in various cyber-attacks, often for initial access and persistence.

2. **Exploitation of CVE-2018-20250**: CVE-2018-20250 is a vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows SMB (Server Message Block) service. Exploiting this vulnerability typically involves delivering the exploit to a target system, which can be done through various methods such as spear-phishing emails, malicious websites, or other vectors.

3. **Spear-Phishing Emails**: Spear-phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers craft emails that appear to come from a trusted source. This method is often used to deliver malware or exploits to specific targets.

4. **Scanning for Vulnerable Websites**: This step involves identifying targets that are vulnerable to the exploit. This could be done through automated scanning tools or manual reconnaissance.

5. **Creating C&C Infrastructure**: Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure is used to communicate with the compromised systems. This is often done after initial access has been gained.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This suggests that after deploying malware tools, Elfin would exploit CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing emails only after scanning for vulnerable websites to identify targets or create C&C infrastructure. This sequence makes logical sense as it involves a targeted approach to exploit a specific vulnerability.

- **B: No** - This would imply that Elfin would not follow the described sequence, which seems less plausible given the targeted nature of the attack.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
