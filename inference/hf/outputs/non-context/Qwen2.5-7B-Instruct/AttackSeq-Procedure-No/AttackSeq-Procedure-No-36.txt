To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** The malware uses the Machete tool to enumerate running processes and gather browser data such as bookmarks and stored credentials.
   - **Network Sniffer Module:** The malware deploys a network sniffer to discover user credentials being sent over the network.
   - **Targeting and Exfiltration:** The malware targets and exfiltrates credentials from password stores.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the discovery activities, the malware will deploy a network sniffer to intercept credentials being sent over the network and then target and exfiltrate credentials from password stores.
     - This sequence makes logical sense because after gathering initial data (like browser data and running processes), a network sniffer can capture additional credentials that are not stored locally, such as those sent in network traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not deploy a network sniffer to discover user credentials being sent over the network.
     - This is less likely because a network sniffer can capture credentials that are not stored locally, such as those sent in network traffic, which could be valuable to the attacker.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware first gathers local data (running processes and browser data).
   - The next logical step would be to capture network traffic to find additional credentials that are not stored locally.
   - After capturing these credentials, the malware can then target and exfiltrate them from password stores.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the information provided, the most plausible sequence is that the malware will deploy a network sniffer to discover user credentials being sent over the network before targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores.

Final Answer: A
