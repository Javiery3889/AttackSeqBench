To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Initial Infection Vector**: The Higaisa APT group uses a LNK file to initiate the attack.
2. **Execution Phase**: The LNK file executes a JavaScript file as part of the attack's execution phase.
3. **Persistence**: The JavaScript file is expected to copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence.
4. **Scheduled Tasks**: The JavaScript file is also expected to add 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

**Answer Choice A: Yes**
- This implies that the JavaScript file will indeed copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and add 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
- This sequence aligns with the described attack sequence, where both persistence and maintaining a foothold through scheduled tasks are common TTPs used by APT groups.

**Answer Choice B: No**
- This implies that the JavaScript file will not copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory or add 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
- This does not align with the described attack sequence, as both persistence and maintaining a foothold through scheduled tasks are typical TTPs.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best represented by Answer Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
