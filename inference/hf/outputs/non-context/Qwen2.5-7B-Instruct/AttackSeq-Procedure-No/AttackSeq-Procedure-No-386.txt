To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the attack sequence and the provided answer choices.

1. **APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials**: This step indicates that APT15 has gained high-level access to the network, which is a critical foothold for further operations.

2. **Stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely**: This step shows that APT15 has obtained a method to maintain persistence and access the network from a remote location, which is a common tactic for long-term operations.

3. **Is it likely that APT15 used valid account information to remotely access victim networks, such as VPN credentials, instead of deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS?**

- **Mimikatz and Domain Administrator Credentials**: These are powerful tools that can be used to gain immediate access to the network. However, they are also highly detectable and can be quickly mitigated by the victim organization if discovered.

- **VPN Credentials**: These are also valid account information that can be used to access the network remotely. They are less likely to be detected and can provide a more stealthy method of maintaining access.

- **Backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS)**: These are tools that are often used to maintain persistence and provide a backdoor for future access. They are less likely to be detected by network security measures and can be used to execute commands or exfiltrate data.

Given the context, APT15 likely chose to use the stolen VPN credentials for remote access because it provides a more stealthy and less detectable method compared to deploying backdoors, which are more likely to be detected and mitigated.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
