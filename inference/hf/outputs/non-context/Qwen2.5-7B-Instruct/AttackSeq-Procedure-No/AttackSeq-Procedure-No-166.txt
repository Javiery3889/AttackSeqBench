To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The question mentions that APT10 uses common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for discovery. This is a standard initial step in many APT campaigns.
2. **Compromised AD FS Server**: The question then states that APT10 abuses a compromised AD FS (Security Assertion Markup Language) server's SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) token for lateral movement. This is a sophisticated technique that leverages the trust within the network to move laterally.
3. **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure**: The question asks if APT10 leverages shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure before staging exfiltration data. This is a less common and more complex step that involves using external services.
4. **Exfiltration**: The question mentions staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools. This is a method to hide data exfiltration by breaking it into smaller parts and hiding it in the Recycle Bin.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that APT10 would leverage shared MSP infrastructure before staging exfiltration data. However, the sequence described in the question does not mention this step. The sequence focuses on using a compromised AD FS server for lateral movement and then exfiltrating data. Leveraging an MSP infrastructure is not mentioned and would be an additional, more complex step.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that APT10 would not leverage shared MSP infrastructure before staging exfiltration data. This aligns better with the sequence described in the question, which focuses on using a compromised AD FS server for lateral movement and then exfiltrating data.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The question describes a sequence that starts with reconnaissance, then uses a compromised AD FS server for lateral movement.
2. The sequence then directly moves to exfiltrating data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin.
3. There is no mention of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure in the sequence described.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
