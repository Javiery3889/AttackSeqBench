Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts.
   - The next step in the sequence is whether these collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.
     - While it is possible for an attacker to design a malware or script to automatically exfiltrate data, the question does not provide any specific information that would indicate this automatic exfiltration is part of the TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the collected email accounts will not be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.
     - Without additional context, it is more plausible that the collected data would need to be manually exfiltrated or that the exfiltration process would be more complex and not automatically done.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question does not provide any specific information that would indicate automatic exfiltration over FTP.
   - In many cases, attackers prefer to maintain control and ensure that data is exfiltrated only when they are ready, often through manual or more complex exfiltration methods.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the information provided would be that the collected email accounts will not be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

**Final Answer: B**
