To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and analyze the provided answer choices.

1. **Initial TTPs Mentioned:**
   - Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives.
   - Archiving the data locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.

2. **Question's Focus:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 (a known APT group) is likely to use DNS Calculation techniques to determine a command and control (C2) port.
   - It also mentions exfiltrating the data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools.

3. **DNS Calculation Techniques:**
   - DNS Calculation is a method where certain values (like the first two octets of an IP address and the third octet) are used to derive a C2 port. This technique is not commonly associated with FIN13's known TTPs.

4. **Exfiltration Methods:**
   - Exfiltrating data over web services using web shells and JSP tools is a known TTP for FIN13. They have been observed using web shells and JSP tools for data exfiltration.

5. **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that FIN13 uses DNS Calculation techniques, which is not a typical TTP for this group.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that FIN13 does not use DNS Calculation techniques, which aligns more closely with their known TTPs.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. FIN13 is known to use web shells and JSP tools for data exfiltration, which matches the second part of the question.
2. DNS Calculation techniques are not a known TTP for FIN13 and are not typically associated with their operations.

**Final Answer: B: No**
