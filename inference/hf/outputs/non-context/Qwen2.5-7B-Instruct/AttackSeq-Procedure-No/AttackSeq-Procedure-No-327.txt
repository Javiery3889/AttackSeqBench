Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) during the Command and Control phase of an iOS malware attack.
   - These TTPs include:
     - Sending gathered information
     - Writing log messages
     - Using a token for communication
     - Uploading files
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the app will subsequently collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The Command and Control phase typically involves the malware establishing a connection with its C2 server and maintaining that connection to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - The Discovery phase, on the other hand, is about the malware identifying and collecting information about the victim's device and environment.
   - The TTPs mentioned (sending information, writing log messages, using a token, and uploading files) are more aligned with the Command and Control phase rather than the Discovery phase.
   - Collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data are indeed part of the Discovery phase, as they involve gathering information about the victim's device and environment.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the Command and Control phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the app will collect specific types of information (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data) during the Discovery phase.
   - Given that the TTPs mentioned are part of the Command and Control phase, it is reasonable to infer that the malware would continue to perform Discovery phase activities after establishing control.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would collect the specified types of information during the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
