To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the scenario and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Lure**: Recipients are presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report. This is a common social engineering tactic to gain the trust of the recipient.

2. **Spear Phishing Emails**: After the initial lure, recipients receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents. This is another social engineering tactic to trick the recipient into clicking on the link.

3. **Exploitation of CVE-2017-8750**: The RTF documents exploit CVE-2017-8750, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows for remote code execution. This is a technical step that enables the delivery of malware.

4. **QuasarRAT Delivery**: The exploitation of the vulnerability leads to the delivery of QuasarRAT, a remote access trojan. This is the final step in the sequence, where the attacker gains remote access to the victim's system.

5. **Sequence Evaluation**:
   - **Answer Choice A (Yes)**: This suggests that the sequence of TTPs (lure, spear phishing, exploitation, and QuasarRAT delivery) is plausible and follows a logical order.
   - **Answer Choice B (No)**: This would imply that the sequence is not plausible or does not follow a logical order.

Given the logical flow of the attack sequence described, where each step builds upon the previous one, the sequence is indeed plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
