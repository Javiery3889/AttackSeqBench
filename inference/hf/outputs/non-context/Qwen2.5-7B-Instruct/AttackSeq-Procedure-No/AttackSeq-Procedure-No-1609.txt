To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the components and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Exfiltration of Kavach Authentication Databases**: The question mentions that GoLang-based file recon plugins are used to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases. This indicates a specific method of data collection and exfiltration.

2. **Credential Access**: The question then asks about the likelihood of SideCopy targeting access credentials from Indian government employees. This suggests a specific target and a specific method of credential access.

3. **Use of njRAT**: The question specifies that njRAT is used only after the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases. This implies a sequence where the initial step is exfiltration, followed by the use of njRAT for credential access.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is plausible. It aligns with the idea that the attack starts with exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases, and then uses njRAT to target specific credentials from Indian government employees.

- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the sequence described in the question is not plausible. However, the question does not provide any information that contradicts the sequence described.

Given the information provided, the sequence described in the question is logically consistent and follows a plausible attack pattern.

**Final Answer: A**
