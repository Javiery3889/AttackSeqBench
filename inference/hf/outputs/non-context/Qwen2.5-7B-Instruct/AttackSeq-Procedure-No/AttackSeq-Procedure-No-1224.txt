Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Evading Detection**: The TTP mentioned is customizing its installation to avoid analysis by security researchers and security products. This is a common tactic used by advanced threats to remain undetected.

2. **LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning**: This TTP involves poisoning the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) to redirect network traffic and gather credentials. This is a method to capture NTLM hashes, which can be used to gain further access.

3. **SMB Relay**: This TTP involves using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to relay traffic and gain additional access or escalate privileges. It can be used to further compromise the network and gather more credentials.

4. **Gathering NetNTLM Credentials**: The TTPs mentioned (LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay) are directly aimed at gathering NetNTLM credentials, which are used for authentication in Windows environments.

5. **Exfiltrating Data**: After gathering credentials, the next step is likely to exfiltrate data. Compressed and encrypted network traffic is a common method to avoid detection during data exfiltration.

Given the sequence of TTPs and their purpose, the described sequence is plausible and aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threats like T9000.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
