To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where TG1021 initially gains access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets instead of the described method.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits were used instead of the described method. However, the question already states that TG1021 used a specific method (exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability). This implies that the described method was used, and there is no indication that a different method was employed.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described method (exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability) was used, and it is unlikely that watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits were used instead. This aligns with the information provided in the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question explicitly states that TG1021 used a specific method to gain initial access, which involves exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - There is no information provided that suggests TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits instead.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one described in the question.

**Final Answer: B**
