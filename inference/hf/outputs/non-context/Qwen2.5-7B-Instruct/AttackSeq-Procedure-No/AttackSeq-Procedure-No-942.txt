Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving SLUB malware interacting with a Mattermost server during the Discovery phase.
- It mentions that the malware collects system information and captures screenshots.
- The question then asks if the malware is likely to automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to a C2 server during the Exfiltration phase.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- SLUB malware is known to perform reconnaissance and data collection activities, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
- The question specifies that the malware collects system information and captures screenshots, which are typical actions during the Discovery phase.
- The Exfiltration phase involves the transfer of collected data to a Command and Control (C2) server, which is a common next step after data collection.
- Given that SLUB malware is designed to gather and exfiltrate data, it is highly plausible that after the Discovery phase, the malware would proceed to the Exfiltration phase to send the collected data to the C2 server.

Final Answer: A
