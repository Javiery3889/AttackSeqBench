Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The group has already used stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.
   - The next step is to deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
   - This deployment is only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This implies that after gaining persistent access, the group would conduct a vulnerability scan on specific external IP addresses to identify vulnerable services before deploying public exploits.
     - This sequence makes sense because conducting a vulnerability scan helps the group to identify the exact targets and vulnerabilities, which is a logical step before deploying exploits.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This implies that the group would not conduct a vulnerability scan and would directly deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
     - This sequence is less likely because it skips a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, which is to identify the exact vulnerabilities and targets before exploiting them.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the group has already gained persistent access and is planning to deploy public exploits.
   - Conducting a vulnerability scan is a standard practice in ethical hacking and cyber attacks to identify the exact vulnerabilities and targets.
   - This step ensures that the group is deploying the right exploits on the right targets, which increases the likelihood of a successful attack.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is to conduct a vulnerability scan before deploying public exploits.

**Final Answer: A**
