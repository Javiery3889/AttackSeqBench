Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Shellbot malware. Specifically, it mentions the establishment of C&C (Command and Control) communication via an IRC channel and then asks if the malware is likely to gather specific types of information about the infected host.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the Shellbot is likely to gather detailed information about the infected host, including the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions are installed.
  - Shellbot is known for its ability to gather system information to better understand the environment it has infected. This information can be crucial for the attacker to tailor further actions or to evade detection by existing security measures.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the Shellbot does not gather such detailed information about the infected host.
  - While it is possible that the malware might not gather this specific information, it is less likely given the typical behavior of malware like Shellbot, which often seeks to understand the target environment thoroughly.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Shellbot malware is known for its ability to gather detailed information about the infected system to better understand and exploit the environment.
- Gathering information such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions is a common practice for malware to tailor its actions and evade detection.
- Therefore, it is more plausible that the Shellbot would gather this type of information.

Final Answer: A
