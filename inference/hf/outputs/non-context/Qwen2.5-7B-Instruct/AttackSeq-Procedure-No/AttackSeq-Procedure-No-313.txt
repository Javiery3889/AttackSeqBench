Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Self-deleting code:** This is a tactic used to remove traces of their presence, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - **Remote-desktop protocol (RDP):** This is a method used to move laterally among internal or external systems, which is part of the Lateral Movement tactic.
   - **Gathering system information on Windows systems:** This is part of the Initial Access and Discovery tactics.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Dragonfly group used RDP to move laterally and then gathered system information on Windows systems.
     - The Dragonfly group is known for using RDP for lateral movement and often targets Windows systems for information gathering.
     - The sequence of TTPs (self-deleting code for Defense Evasion, RDP for Lateral Movement, and gathering system information on Windows systems for Discovery) aligns with typical Dragonfly group behavior.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Dragonfly group did not use RDP for lateral movement or gather system information on Windows systems.
     - This does not align with known Dragonfly group tactics, as they are known to use RDP for lateral movement and target Windows systems for information gathering.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (self-deleting code for Defense Evasion, RDP for Lateral Movement, and gathering system information on Windows systems for Discovery) is consistent with the Dragonfly group's known tactics.

Final Answer: Yes
