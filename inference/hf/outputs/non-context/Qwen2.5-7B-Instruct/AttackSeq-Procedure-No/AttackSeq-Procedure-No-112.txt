Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The attackers have already gained knowledge of systems, users, and data through the discovery phase.
   - The next step in the sequence is to taint shared content to achieve lateral movement.
   - After that, they will install additional persistence points on new systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Tainting shared content is a common method to achieve lateral movement. By tampering with shared files or content, attackers can spread malware or backdoors to other systems within the network.
     - Once lateral movement is achieved, it is logical to install persistence mechanisms on new systems to maintain access and ensure the attackers can return to the network at a later time.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers would not taint shared content to achieve lateral movement and would not install persistence points on new systems. This sequence does not align with typical attacker behavior, as lateral movement and persistence are crucial steps in maintaining access and control over a network.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already gathered information through the discovery phase.
   - Tainting shared content is a strategic move to spread malware or backdoors, which is a common method for achieving lateral movement.
   - Once lateral movement is achieved, it is logical to install persistence mechanisms to maintain long-term access to the network.

**Final Answer: A**
