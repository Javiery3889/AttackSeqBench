To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Exploiting CVE-2017-11882**: This is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user opens a specially crafted document. This is a common initial access vector for attackers.

2. **Establishing Persistence**: The attackers are likely to establish persistence to ensure they can maintain access to the compromised system. Writing a script to a location like `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a registry run key are common persistence mechanisms.

3. **Deploying a PowerShell Backdoor (POWERSHOWER)**: After establishing persistence, the attackers would likely deploy a backdoor to maintain long-term access. POWERSHOWER is a known PowerShell-based backdoor.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This suggests that the sequence of TTPs (exploiting the vulnerability, establishing persistence, and deploying the backdoor) is plausible and follows a logical order.
  
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the sequence is not plausible, which would mean that the steps do not logically follow each other or that there is a significant gap or error in the sequence.

Given the logical flow of the attack sequence, where initial access is gained, persistence is established, and then a backdoor is deployed, the sequence described in Answer Choice A is the most plausible.

**Final Answer: Yes**
