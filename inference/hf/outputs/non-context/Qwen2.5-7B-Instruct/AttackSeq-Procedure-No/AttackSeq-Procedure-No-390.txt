Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Technical, Tactical, and Procedural steps) used by threat actors.
- The first TTP mentioned is AtomBombing, which is a technique to inject malicious code into a process by leveraging Windows API functions.
- The second TTP is the execution of the malicious code via legitimate programs.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actors will use a VBA script, embedded within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - AtomBombing is a technique that can be used to inject malicious code into a process, but it does not specify the type of payload or how it is delivered.
  - A VBA script embedded in a malicious Word document is a common method for delivering malware, as it can exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office applications.
  - The combination of AtomBombing to inject the VBA script and then using a Word document to deliver the payload is a plausible and sophisticated attack strategy.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the use of a VBA script in a Word document is not likely after using AtomBombing.
  - This is less plausible because AtomBombing is a method to inject code, and a VBA script in a Word document is a common and effective way to deliver and execute that code.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- AtomBombing is a technique to inject malicious code into a process.
- The question does not specify the type of payload or how it is delivered, but it is common for threat actors to use a VBA script in a Word document to deliver the payload.
- Using a VBA script in a Word document is a well-known method to exploit Office vulnerabilities and execute malicious code.
- Therefore, it is highly plausible that after using AtomBombing to inject malicious code, the threat actors would use a VBA script embedded in a malicious Word document to deliver and execute the payload.

Final Answer: A
