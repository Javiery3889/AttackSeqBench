Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The question mentions the use of reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager. This technique is often used to load malicious code into the memory of a process without writing it to disk, which can help evade certain types of detection.
   - The question also mentions the use of primary C2 (Command and Control) servers for initial communication and victim information relay.

2. **Evaluating the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will use secondary C2 servers for communication after establishing connectivity and relaying victim information to primary C2 servers.
   - This implies a scenario where the attackers might want to maintain flexibility and resilience in their communication channels.

3. **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that using secondary C2 servers is a plausible and likely strategy.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that using secondary C2 servers is unlikely or not a common practice.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - In many advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios, adversaries often use multiple C2 servers to ensure redundancy and resilience. This can help them maintain control over the compromised system even if one C2 server is taken down.
   - Secondary C2 servers can be used to offload traffic, provide additional command and control capabilities, or serve as a fallback in case the primary C2 server is detected or taken down.
   - The use of reflective code loading with Empire DLL Launcher stager indicates a sophisticated and stealthy approach, which is often associated with APTs that employ such tactics.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context of sophisticated and stealthy attacks, it is reasonable to assume that adversaries would use secondary C2 servers to maintain their operations and evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
