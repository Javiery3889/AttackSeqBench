Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Ensuring persistence by auto-starting at device boot through listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.
     2. Identifying the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host.
     3. Uploading exfiltrated data to its C&C server using the HTTP protocol.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Welcome Chat app is likely to identify the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host before uploading the exfiltrated data.
     - For this to be true, the app would need to have the capability to detect and identify anti-virus products, which is a non-trivial task and not a common TTP in typical malware or malicious apps.
     - The primary focus of such apps is often to avoid detection and exfiltrate data, so identifying the anti-virus product might not be a standard step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Welcome Chat app is unlikely to identify the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host before uploading the exfiltrated data.
     - This is more plausible because the primary goal of the app is to exfiltrate data and maintain persistence, and identifying the anti-virus product is not a necessary step in achieving these goals.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the step of identifying the installed anti-virus product before uploading the exfiltrated data.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "Final Answer: B"
