To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and analyze each answer choice.

### Analysis of the Question:
1. **Delivery Method**: The attack uses malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading.
2. **Execution Method**: The Office document uses base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.
3. **Content**: The document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

### Answer Choices:
A: Yes
B: No

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Delivery Method**: The use of malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading is a common TTP used by adversaries to deliver malware. This method leverages the trust users have in Microsoft Office documents and the ability to load and execute arbitrary code through DLL side-loading.

2. **Execution Method**: Base64 encoding is often used to obfuscate the payload, making it harder for antivirus software to detect the malicious content. The fact that the payload is executed based on the victim's system architecture suggests that the malware is designed to be architecture-specific, which is a common tactic to evade detection and ensure compatibility.

3. **Content**: The inclusion of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros is a social engineering tactic. This is a common method used to bypass security measures and trick users into enabling potentially harmful macros.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:
- **Choice A (Yes)**: This choice aligns with the described attack sequence. The use of base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture is a plausible and common technique. The inclusion of an image file to trick the user into enabling macros is also a well-known social engineering tactic.
- **Choice B (No)**: This choice does not align with the described attack sequence. There is no clear reason why the described sequence would not be plausible.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is best represented by Choice A.

Final Answer: Yes
