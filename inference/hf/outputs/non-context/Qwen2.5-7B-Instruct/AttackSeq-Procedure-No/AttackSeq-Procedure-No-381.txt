To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that APT15 gains initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials. This is a common TTP for APT15, as seen in various CTI reports.

2. **Execution Evasion and Command Execution**: The question then asks if APT15 is likely to deploy tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution. RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS are known tools used by APT15 for execution evasion and command execution. RoyalCLI is a command-line interface for Windows that can be used to execute commands without the need for a user interface, and RoyalDNS is a tool that can be used to perform DNS-based command and control (C2) communications, which helps in evading detection.

3. **OS Credential Dumping**: Finally, the question mentions the use of Mimikatz for OS credential dumping. Mimikatz is a well-known tool used by APT groups, including APT15, to dump credentials from memory, which is a common post-exploitation activity.

Given this analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with APT15's known behavior. APT15 typically uses stolen credentials to gain initial access, then deploys tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution, and finally uses Mimikatz for credential dumping.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. Initial access through stolen credentials is a common TTP for APT15.
2. Deployment of RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution is consistent with APT15's known tactics.
3. Use of Mimikatz for credential dumping is a standard post-exploitation activity for APT15.

**Final Answer: A**
