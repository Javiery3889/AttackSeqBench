To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing**: The attack starts with a spear-phishing email that contains a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.

2. **Execution of 'show.swf'**: The Flash file 'show.swf' is executed, which is a common technique to deliver the payload.

3. **Shellcode Execution for Defense Evasion**: The question mentions that the Flash file 'show.swf' will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion. This is a tactic to evade detection and security measures.

4. **Installation of Payload**: After the shellcode is executed, the payload embedded in the GIF image is installed.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This suggests that the Flash file 'show.swf' will first execute shellcode for Defense Evasion and then install the payload.
  - This sequence is plausible because it aligns with the typical behavior of many malware campaigns where initial shellcode is used to evade detection before the main payload is installed.

- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This suggests that the Flash file 'show.swf' will not execute shellcode for Defense Evasion before installing the payload.
  - This sequence is less plausible because it implies that the payload is installed directly without any initial evasion tactics, which is less common in sophisticated attacks.

Given the typical behavior of malware and the need for evasion techniques, the most plausible sequence is that the Flash file 'show.swf' will first execute shellcode for Defense Evasion and then install the payload.

Final Answer: Yes
