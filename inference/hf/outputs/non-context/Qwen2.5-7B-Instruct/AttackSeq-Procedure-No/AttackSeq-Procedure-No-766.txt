Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Iranian state-backed hackers used phishing attacks through email and social media accounts to gain initial access.
   - The targets were individuals involved in sanctions against Iran.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that these hackers scanned specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after gaining initial access through phishing, the hackers would further refine their targeting by scanning specific lists of IP addresses.
     - This is a plausible scenario because once initial access is gained, attackers often look to expand their foothold and target additional systems or networks.
     - Scanning IP addresses can help them identify and prioritize additional targets that are relevant to their objectives.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the hackers did not scan specific lists of IP addresses after gaining initial access.
     - While it is possible that they did not, this is less likely given the sophistication typically associated with state-backed hackers. They would likely want to maximize their reach and impact.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a targeted attack where the initial access was gained through phishing, which is a common method for state-backed hackers.
   - After gaining initial access, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would want to expand their reach and target additional systems or networks.
   - Scanning specific lists of IP addresses is a common tactic to identify and prioritize additional targets that are relevant to their objectives.
   - Given the sophistication of state-backed hackers and the need to maximize their impact, it is more plausible that they would engage in such activities.

**Final Answer: A**
