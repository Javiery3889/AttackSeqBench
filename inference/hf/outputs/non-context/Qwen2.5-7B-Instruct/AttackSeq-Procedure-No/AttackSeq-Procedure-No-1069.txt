To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and analyze the provided information.

1. **Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe**: This is a common technique used by malware to maintain persistence and execute arbitrary code within a trusted process.

2. **Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads**: This indicates that the attackers are leveraging a known vulnerability (likely in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor) to deliver and execute a payload.

3. **Executing the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe only after the above steps**: The FakeRun loader is a technique used to disguise the execution of malicious code by using legitimate-looking processes or files. This step suggests an additional layer of obfuscation to avoid detection.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. It aligns with the typical behavior of Tropic Trooper, which is known for using Equation Editor exploits and employing obfuscation techniques like FakeRun to execute malicious payloads.

- **B: No**: This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible, which contradicts the known TTPs of Tropic Trooper.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
