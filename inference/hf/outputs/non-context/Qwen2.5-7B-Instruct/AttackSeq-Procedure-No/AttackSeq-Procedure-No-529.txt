To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Targeting Diplomatic and Economic Entities**: This step is about gathering victim identity information. This is a common initial reconnaissance phase where attackers gather intelligence about potential targets.

2. **Dropping Elephant**: This likely refers to a specific malware or tool used by the attackers. Elephant is a term sometimes used in cybersecurity to describe large-scale data breaches or malware that can persist for a long time.

3. **UPX-packed Backdoors**: UPX (Ultimate Pack for eXecutables) is a common packer used to compress executable files. Packing an executable can help evade simple signature-based detection. A backdoor is a method to gain unauthorized access to a system, often used to maintain persistence or to facilitate further attacks.

4. **Downloading Additional Malware**: This step involves the attacker downloading more malware to the compromised system, which could be used for various purposes such as data exfiltration, further reconnaissance, or lateral movement.

5. **Spear-Phishing Emails Containing Malicious Documents**: This is a common method for gaining initial access to a network. Spear-phishing is highly targeted and often uses social engineering to trick the victim into opening a malicious document, which can then execute malware.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. The steps align with a typical advanced persistent threat (APT) attack sequence where initial reconnaissance is followed by the use of sophisticated tools and techniques to maintain access and gather more information.

- **B: No**: This choice would imply that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible. However, the steps described are consistent with known APT tactics and techniques.

Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed likely to be followed by Dropping Elephant, UPX-packing, downloading additional malware, and then using spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.

Final Answer: A
