Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Bvp47.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a loader to decrypt and load its payload.
     - Hiding processes, files, and network connections for persistence.
   - The question then asks if Bvp47 is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections as part of its discovery tactic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Bvp47 would use its persistence mechanism to discover systems over a LAN.
     - Given that Bvp47 is already using a loader and hiding its presence, it is plausible that it would continue to use network discovery techniques to find and exploit other systems on the same network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Bvp47 would not use its persistence mechanism to discover systems over a LAN.
     - This seems less likely because once Bvp47 has established persistence, it would have the opportunity and motive to further explore and exploit the network.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Bvp47, as a malware, is designed to maintain persistence and stealth. Once it has established a foothold on a system, it would likely use this opportunity to discover and exploit other systems on the same network.
   - The persistence mechanism ensures that Bvp47 remains active and undetected, which is a prerequisite for further network exploration.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Bvp47 would use its persistence to discover and exploit other systems over LAN connections.

**Final Answer: A**
