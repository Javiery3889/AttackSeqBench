To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs (Technical, Operational, and Tactical Procedures) based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze each answer choice.

1. **Reconnaissance**: The question states that ProjectM actors conducted reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains. This is a common initial step in many cyber-attacks, where the attackers gather information about potential victims.

2. **Collection of Location Information**: The question then asks if it is likely that they collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites. This step involves the attackers potentially using techniques to gather specific data from the victims, such as IP addresses, geolocation data, or other personal information.

3. **Execution of Trojans**: The question mentions that the attackers moved forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy. Trojans are malicious software that can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system, install backdoors, or perform other malicious activities.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that after reconnaissance and identifying targets, the attackers collected location information from visitors to their phishing sites before executing Trojans. This sequence is plausible because it follows a logical progression:
    1. Reconnaissance to identify targets.
    2. Phishing to collect more specific information (like location).
    3. Execution of Trojans to gain deeper access.

- **B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the attackers did not collect location information from visitors to their phishing sites before executing Trojans. This sequence is less plausible because it skips a step that could provide valuable intelligence to the attackers, which might be used to tailor the attack more effectively.

Given the logical progression and the typical methods used in cyber-attacks, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one that includes the collection of location information as a step before executing Trojans.

**Final Answer: A**
