Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The attack sequence starts with compromising SolarWinds and delivering the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack.
   - The Sunburst backdoor is then used to gain initial access to the target network.

2. **Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Compromise SolarWinds.
   - Deliver Sunburst backdoor.
   - Gain initial access.

3. **Communication with C2 Server:**
   - The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only after the initial access is achieved.

4. **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server only after initial access is achieved.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that the Sunburst backdoor will not communicate with its C2 server only after initial access is achieved.

5. **Reasoning:**
   - The Sunburst backdoor was designed to be stealthy and to avoid detection. It was intended to establish a foothold within the network and then communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework includes techniques such as "T1071 - Application Layer Protocol" and "T1021 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel" which describe how malware communicates with its C2 server.
   - Given the nature of the Sunburst backdoor, it is highly likely that it would communicate with its C2 server as soon as it gains access, to ensure it can receive further instructions and maintain persistence.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The Sunburst backdoor is designed to communicate with its C2 server as soon as it gains access, not only after initial access is achieved.

Final Answer: B
