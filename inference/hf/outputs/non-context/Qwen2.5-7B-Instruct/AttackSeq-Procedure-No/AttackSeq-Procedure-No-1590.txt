To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the question and the provided answer choices.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scanning phase where tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and commands such as 'hbs.exe' are used to scan a range of IP addresses for specific ports.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca (a known threat actor) will use pass the ticket (PtT) methods for lateral movement after this scanning phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Earth Lusca is known to use various methods for lateral movement, including PtT. PtT involves using a ticket from a legitimate user to gain access to other systems within the same domain. Given that the scanning phase has likely identified open ports and potentially vulnerable systems, it is plausible that Earth Lusca would use PtT to move laterally within the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Earth Lusca would not use PtT for lateral movement after the scanning phase. However, given the nature of Earth Lusca and the fact that PtT is a common method for lateral movement, this seems less likely.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The scanning phase is a common initial step in an attack to identify potential targets.
   - Earth Lusca is known to use PtT as a method for lateral movement, which involves leveraging Kerberos tickets to move between systems within the same domain.
   - After identifying open ports and potentially vulnerable systems, it is reasonable to assume that Earth Lusca would use PtT to move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that Earth Lusca would indeed use PtT for lateral movement after the scanning phase.

Final Answer: A
