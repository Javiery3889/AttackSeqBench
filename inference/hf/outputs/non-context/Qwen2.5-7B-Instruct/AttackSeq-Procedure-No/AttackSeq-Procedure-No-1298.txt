To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Achieving Credential Access:**
   - The question mentions the use of Procdump and Mimikatz to extract credentials. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain initial access and escalate privileges.

2. **Pass-the-Hash Attacks:**
   - The use of 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks is a method to maintain access and move laterally within the network using the extracted credentials without needing to crack the hashes.

3. **Lateral Movement and Lateral Spread:**
   - The question asks if the Fox Kitten Campaign is likely to use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement.

### Analysis of Answer Choices:

**A: Yes**
- **PDQ Deploy** is a legitimate software used for remote management and deployment of software across a network. However, it can be repurposed by attackers for lateral movement and deployment of malware like AvosLocker.
- The Fox Kitten Campaign, known for its use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes, could potentially use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement and deployment of malware.

**B: No**
- This would imply that the Fox Kitten Campaign does not use PDQ Deploy for such purposes, which is less likely given the known tactics of the campaign to repurpose legitimate tools for malicious activities.

### Conclusion:
Given the known tactics of the Fox Kitten Campaign to use legitimate tools for malicious purposes, it is plausible that they would use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement and deployment of malware like AvosLocker.

**Final Answer: A**
