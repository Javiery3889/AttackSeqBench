To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the answer choices.

1. **Lateral Movement**: The question mentions that the attack starts with lateral movement using WMIC and compromised routers to bypass network segmentation. This is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors to move within a network.

2. **Credential Harvesting**: The question then asks about the use of the Responder tool to harvest credentials. The Responder tool is a part of the Metasploit framework and is used to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to capture credentials from network traffic. This is a common method used by threat actors to gain access to additional systems.

3. **Discovery Activities**: The question asks if the Lazarus group will conduct discovery activities such as file and directory discovery after using the Responder tool. Discovery activities are a critical step in the attack lifecycle, where the threat actor gathers information about the network and systems to understand the environment and identify potential targets.

4. **Answer Choices**:
   - **A: Yes**: This suggests that after using the Responder tool to harvest credentials, the Lazarus group will proceed to conduct discovery activities.
   - **B: No**: This suggests that the Lazarus group will not conduct discovery activities after using the Responder tool to harvest credentials.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- The use of WMIC and compromised routers for lateral movement is a common tactic.
- The use of the Responder tool to harvest credentials is a method to gain additional access points within the network.
- Discovery activities such as file and directory discovery are typically conducted after gaining access to understand the network and systems better.

Given that the Responder tool is used to gain credentials, which can provide access to more systems, it is logical that the next step would be to conduct discovery activities to understand the network and systems better.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
