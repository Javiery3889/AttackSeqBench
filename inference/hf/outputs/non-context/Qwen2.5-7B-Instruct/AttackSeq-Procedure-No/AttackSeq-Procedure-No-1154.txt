Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the SBDH malware.
- The malware first employs filters to collect targeted data.
- The question then asks if the malware will incorporate junk data into encoded strings for network communication with its C&C server.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed incorporate junk data into encoded strings to prevent trivial decoding.
  - This is a common practice in malware to obfuscate communication and evade detection by security systems.
- **Answer Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware will not incorporate junk data into encoded strings.
  - This would make the communication more predictable and easier to decode, which is less likely for sophisticated malware.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SBDH malware is described as employing powerful filters to collect targeted data, indicating a sophisticated approach to data collection.
- Incorporating junk data into encoded strings is a standard technique used by malware to obfuscate communication and make it more difficult for security systems to detect and decode.
- This technique aligns with the Command and Control (C2) tactic, where malware communicates with its C&C server in a way that is difficult to intercept or understand.

Final Answer: A
