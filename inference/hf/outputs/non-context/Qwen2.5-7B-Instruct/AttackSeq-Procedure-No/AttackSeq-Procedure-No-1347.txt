Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     1. Evading detection through overlay screens.
     2. Installing a payload app.
     3. Encrypting data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.
     4. Exfiltrating data to a C&C server.
     5. Collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice implies that the callCam app will indeed follow the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
     - Evading detection through overlay screens is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection by security software.
     - Installing a payload app is a typical method for delivering malware.
     - Encrypting data using RSA and AES is a common practice to ensure data confidentiality and integrity during exfiltration.
     - Exfiltrating data to a C&C server is a standard method for attackers to communicate with their command and control infrastructure.
     - Collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices is a common tactic to gather sensitive information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice implies that the callCam app will not follow the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
     - While it is possible that the app might not follow all these steps, the question does not provide any information that would suggest this is the case.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the common practices and techniques used by malware, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with typical behavior of such malware.

**Final Answer: A**
