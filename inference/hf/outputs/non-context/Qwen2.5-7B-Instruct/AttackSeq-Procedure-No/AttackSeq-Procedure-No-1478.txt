Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
   - Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks using Mimikatz PowerShell.
   - Extracting emails from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials.
   - Logging keystrokes on the victimâ€™s machine.
   - Securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS using Base64 and RC4/AES encryption.

2. **Evaluating Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - The Duke group is known for using a variety of TTPs, including credential access, data exfiltration, and maintaining persistence. Keystroke logging is a common method used by APTs to gather additional sensitive information. Secure communication over HTTP/HTTPS with encryption (Base64 and RC4/AES) is also a typical method used by APTs to avoid detection.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the Duke group does not use keystroke logging or secure communication methods, which contradicts their known tactics and techniques.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that are consistent with the Duke group's known behavior.
   - Keystroke logging is a method used to gather additional sensitive information, which is valuable for an APT group.
   - Secure communication methods like HTTP/HTTPS with encryption are used to ensure that the communication is not easily intercepted or detected.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known tactics of the Duke group, it is highly plausible that they would use keystroke logging and secure communication methods as described in the question.

Final Answer: Yes
