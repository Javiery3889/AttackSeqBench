Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The CostaRicto Campaign used the SombRAT backdoor.
   - SombRAT communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The purpose of this communication was to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel.
   - The question asks if it is likely that SombRAT performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Discovery and System Information Discovery:** These are common activities during the Discovery phase of an attack. The purpose of these activities is to gather information about the target environment, such as identifying running processes, services, and system configurations, which can help the attacker understand the target's infrastructure and plan further actions.
   - **Context of SombRAT:** SombRAT is a backdoor that is known for its ability to maintain persistence and gather information from the compromised system. Given its capabilities, it is highly likely that it would perform process discovery and system information discovery as part of its operations.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - SombRAT is a sophisticated backdoor, which implies it has the capability to perform detailed reconnaissance.
   - Establishing a C2 channel is a critical step, but it is often followed by gathering as much information as possible about the target system to better understand and exploit it.
   - Process discovery and system information discovery are standard activities in the Discovery phase of an attack, and SombRAT, being a well-known and capable backdoor, would likely engage in these activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly plausible that SombRAT would perform process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: A: Yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
