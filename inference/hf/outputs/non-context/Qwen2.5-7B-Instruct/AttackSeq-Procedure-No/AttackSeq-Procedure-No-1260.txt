Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step.

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlueBravo (a hypothetical APT group) has already established persistence on a victim's system by creating registry run keys to ensure the malware runs during system startup.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if BlueBravo is likely to use network sniffing techniques, specifically deploying Responder to conduct NetBIOS Name Service poisoning, to gather victim system information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Responder is a tool that can be used to perform NetBIOS Name Service poisoning, which can reveal information about the network, such as usernames, workstations, and shares. This aligns with the goal of gathering victim system information.
     - NetBIOS Name Service poisoning is a common technique used by APT groups to gather information about the network topology and to identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that BlueBravo is unlikely to use such a technique, which does not align with the typical behavior of APT groups that often use such methods to gather intelligence and prepare for further attacks.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - BlueBravo, as an APT group, is likely to use advanced and stealthy techniques to gather information about the victim's network and systems.
   - NetBIOS Name Service poisoning, facilitated by tools like Responder, is a well-known method for gathering such information.
   - The use of this technique would help BlueBravo understand the network environment, identify potential targets, and plan further attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
