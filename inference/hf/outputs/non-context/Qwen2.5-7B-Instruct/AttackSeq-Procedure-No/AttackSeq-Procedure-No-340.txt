Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Nemesis bootkit has achieved persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR).
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if the malware is likely to evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - Placing install files in directories that are excluded from scanning is a common technique to evade detection. This method ensures that the files remain hidden from security software that does not scan those specific directories.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware would not use such a technique, which is less likely given the common practices of malware to avoid detection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Nemesis bootkit, being a sophisticated piece of malware, is likely to employ various evasion techniques to remain undetected.
   - One such technique is to place its files in directories that are typically excluded from scanning by security software. This is a common practice in malware to avoid detection.
   - By placing install files in such directories, the malware can ensure that it remains hidden from security tools that do not scan those specific locations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware would indeed use this technique to evade detection.

Final Answer: A
