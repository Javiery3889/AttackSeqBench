Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The question mentions two TTPs:
     - **Seaduke for Exfiltration:** This is a technique used by the Duke group to exfiltrate sensitive data to legitimate cloud services.
     - **Secure Communication with Command and Control (C2):** This involves using Seaduke to communicate with the C2 server, employing multiple layers of encryption and encoding.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Duke group would use Seaduke for both exfiltration and secure communication with the C2 server. While Seaduke is primarily known for exfiltration, it is plausible that the same tool or a similar tool could be used for secure communication if it provides the necessary encryption and encoding capabilities.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Duke group would not use Seaduke for secure communication with the C2 server. However, this is less likely because using the same tool for both exfiltration and secure communication can provide a consistent and potentially more efficient method of operation.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of the same tool (Seaduke) for both exfiltration and secure communication can be a strategic choice for the attackers. It ensures consistency in the use of encryption and encoding methods, which can help in maintaining operational security and reducing the risk of detection.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework often shows that attackers use the same tools and techniques for multiple purposes to streamline their operations and reduce the likelihood of detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
