Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The question mentions the use of Cobalt Strike for network discovery. Cobalt Strike is a well-known tool used for penetration testing and red team operations, often employed to gather information about the target network.

2. **Establishing C2 Connection**: After reconnaissance, the next step is likely to establish a connection with the Command and Control (C2) server. CARBANAK RAT is a known malware used by the CARBANAK group to establish a persistent presence on the network and communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Deploying Secondary Malware**: Once the C2 connection is established, the attacker might deploy secondary malware. Obfuscated scripts can be used to evade detection and ensure that the malware is not easily identified by security tools.

4. **PowerShell RAT**: The use of RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT (Remote Access Tool) is a common technique to gain elevated privileges and maintain persistence. PowerShell is often used because it is a built-in Windows utility that can be used for legitimate purposes, making it harder to detect malicious activity.

5. **Elevated Privileges**: Gaining elevated privileges is crucial for the attacker to maintain control over the system and perform further actions undetected.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the steps align with the typical attack lifecycle observed in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns, particularly those associated with the CARBANAK group.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It follows a logical and common sequence of actions in an APT attack.
- **B: No** - This choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It suggests that the steps do not follow a typical APT attack lifecycle.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
