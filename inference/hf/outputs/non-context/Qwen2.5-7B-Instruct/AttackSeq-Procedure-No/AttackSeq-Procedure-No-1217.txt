Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in an attack scenario.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Compressing and encrypting stolen data.
     2. Exfiltrating the data over a C2 channel.
     3. Stealing sensitive data from Skype communications.
     4. Stealing sensitive data from removable drives.
   - The question asks if the TTP "T9000" (likely a hypothetical or specific threat actor) would then proceed to steal sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives after the initial exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after compressing and encrypting the stolen data and exfiltrating it, T9000 would then proceed to steal sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives.
     - This sequence makes logical sense as part of a comprehensive data theft and exfiltration campaign. After initial data exfiltration, the threat actor might continue to gather more data from various sources.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that T9000 would not proceed to steal sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives after the initial exfiltration.
     - This is less likely because the threat actor would typically continue to gather as much data as possible, especially if the initial exfiltration was successful.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common approach in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns.
   - After exfiltrating the initial batch of data, the threat actor would likely continue to gather more data from different sources to maximize the value of the stolen information.
   - Stealing sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives are common tactics used by threat actors to gather additional valuable information.

**Final Answer: A**
