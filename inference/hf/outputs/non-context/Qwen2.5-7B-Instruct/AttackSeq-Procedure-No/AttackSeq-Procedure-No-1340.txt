To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the information and analyze the options.

1. **FireEye Observation**: The question mentions that FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDOS C2 servers. This indicates that the attackers were using encryption to obfuscate their communication with the C2 servers.

2. **Rebooting the Target System**: The question then asks if it is likely that attackers rebooted the target system once the various wiping processes were complete. This suggests a post-exploitation step where the attackers might have taken additional actions to cover their tracks or ensure the system was in a known state.

3. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**: The question also mentions that the attackers were planning to launch DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong. This indicates a specific target and a planned attack vector.

4. **Next Media's Network Failure**: The question states that the Next Media's network suffered a 'total failure' due to these DDoS attacks. This provides a concrete example of the impact of the planned DDoS attacks.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after the wiping processes were complete, the attackers rebooted the target system. While rebooting could be a plausible action to ensure the system is in a known state, the question does not provide any direct evidence that this occurred. The focus of the question is more on the DDoS attacks and the impact on Next Media's network.

- **B: No**: This choice suggests that the attackers did not reboot the target system after the wiping processes. Given the lack of direct evidence supporting the rebooting action, and the emphasis on the DDoS attacks and their impact, this seems to be the more plausible option.

**Final Answer: B**
