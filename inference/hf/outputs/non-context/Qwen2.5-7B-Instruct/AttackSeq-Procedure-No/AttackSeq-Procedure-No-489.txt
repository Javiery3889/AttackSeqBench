Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **TTPs Mentioned:**
     - Dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz (Credential Access).
     - Collecting system information and probing files (Discovery phase).
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will perform these actions in the described sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This implies that after dumping credentials, FamousSparrow will proceed to the Discovery phase by collecting system information and probing files.
     - This sequence aligns with typical attack patterns where attackers first gain access (dumping credentials) and then gather information about the target environment (Discovery phase).
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This implies that FamousSparrow will not perform the Discovery phase actions after dumping credentials.
     - This would be less likely because the Discovery phase is a crucial step in understanding the target environment and planning further actions.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Dumping credentials is a common initial step in gaining access to a system.
   - **Step 2:** Once credentials are obtained, the next logical step is to gather information about the system and its files to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Step 3:** The MITRE ATT&CK framework supports this sequence, where the "Credential Access" technique is often followed by "Discovery" techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is more plausible that FamousSparrow would perform the Discovery phase actions after dumping credentials.

Final Answer: A
