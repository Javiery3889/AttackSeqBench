Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **System Fingerprinting:** Longhorn performs detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.
   - **Avoiding Detection:** Guidelines from Vault 7 documents are followed to avoid detection.
   - **Exploiting Zero-Day Vulnerability:** A zero-day vulnerability in a Word document is exploited.
   - **Infecting with Plexor Malware:** The target is infected with Plexor malware.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible.
     - System fingerprinting is a common initial step to gather information about the target environment.
     - Following guidelines to avoid detection is a logical next step to ensure the operation remains covert.
     - Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document is a sophisticated and targeted method to gain initial access.
     - Infecting the target with Plexor malware is a plausible final step to establish a persistent presence and maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is not plausible.
     - However, the steps described are a well-known and logical sequence of actions in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible and logical sequence for an APT operation.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the sequence is indeed likely to occur.

Final Answer: Yes
