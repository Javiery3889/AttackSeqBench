To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of CosmicDuke's known behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Achieving Persistence**: The question mentions that CosmicDuke has achieved persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing the 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.' This is a common TTP for CosmicDuke, as it aligns with their known methods of maintaining long-term access.

2. **Enumerating Azure AD Users**: The next step in the sequence is to enumerate Azure AD users. CosmicDuke is known to target Azure AD environments, and enumeration of users is a typical first step in their operations to gather information about the target environment and potential high-value targets.

3. **Collecting Information**: After enumeration, the question states that CosmicDuke will collect information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. These are also common TTPs for CosmicDuke, as they are used to gather sensitive information and monitor user activities.

Given this analysis, the sequence described in the question (persistence, enumeration, and then information collection) aligns with CosmicDuke's known TTPs.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with CosmicDuke's known behavior.
- **B: No** - This choice would imply that the sequence is not plausible, which contradicts the known TTPs of CosmicDuke.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is indeed the one that CosmicDuke is known to follow.

Final Answer: A
