Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The callCam app collects extensive information from compromised devices.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The collected data is sent to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine.
   - **Collection Phase:** The data is encrypted using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the data is first encoded using a customized routine and then encrypted using RSA and AES algorithms.
     - This sequence is plausible because it follows a common practice in cybersecurity where data is often encoded to obfuscate its content before encryption to enhance security.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the data is not encoded using a customized routine and is directly encrypted using RSA and AES algorithms.
     - This sequence is less plausible because it skips the encoding step, which is a common practice to make the data more difficult to understand and manipulate before encryption.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the data is first encoded using a customized routine and then encrypted using RSA and AES algorithms.
   - This sequence is more likely and follows a common practice in cybersecurity to ensure that the data is both obfuscated and secure.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A**
