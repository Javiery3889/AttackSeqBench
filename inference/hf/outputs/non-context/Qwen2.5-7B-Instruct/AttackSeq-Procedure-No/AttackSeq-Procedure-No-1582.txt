To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence described in the question and compare it with the answer choices.

1. **Executing commands to create a service mimicking a system update for deploying a Cobalt Strike loader**: This indicates the initial compromise and the deployment of a backdoor or loader.
2. **Dropping an SSH-authorized key in the /root/.ssh folder**: This action would allow the attacker to gain remote access to the system using SSH without needing to enter a password.
3. **Abuse of elevation control mechanisms and system process modification for privilege escalation**: This step involves gaining higher privileges on the system, likely to maintain persistence and increase the attacker's access rights.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

- **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that after deploying the Cobalt Strike loader, the attacker would drop an SSH-authorized key to enable remote login and then proceed with privilege escalation techniques. This sequence aligns with typical attacker behavior, as gaining remote access and then escalating privileges are common steps in an advanced persistent threat (APT) lifecycle.
- **B: No**: This choice implies that the attacker would not drop an SSH-authorized key and would not use techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms and system process modification for privilege escalation. This is less likely because these steps are crucial for maintaining access and increasing the attacker's privileges.

Given the typical sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks, the most plausible sequence is the one that includes dropping an SSH-authorized key and then using techniques for privilege escalation.

Final Answer: A
