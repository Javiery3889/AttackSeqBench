Let's analyze the question and the answer choices step-by-step:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elderwood Project attackers.
   - The sequence starts with establishing C&C servers.
   - The next step in the sequence is deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks to gain initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after establishing C&C servers, the attackers will indeed deploy zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks to gain initial access.
     - Elderwood Project is known for using sophisticated and targeted attack methods, including the use of zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not deploy zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks to gain initial access.
     - This contradicts the known tactics of the Elderwood Project, which often employ such advanced and targeted methods.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Elderwood Project is a well-known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group that has been associated with the use of zero-day exploits and targeted attacks, including watering hole attacks.
   - Establishing C&C servers is a common first step in maintaining control over compromised systems.
   - Given the nature of the Elderwood Project and their known tactics, it is highly plausible that they would use zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks to gain initial access.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks after establishing C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A**
