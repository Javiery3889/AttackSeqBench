To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's analyze the question and the answer choices in the context of Mustang Panda's known tactics and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

1. **Double Extension Trick**: This is a technique where a file extension is appended to a file to bypass certain security measures. For example, a file named `sample.doc.lnk` is a Word document with a `.lnk` extension, which is typically associated with shortcuts. This technique is often used to evade antivirus software that may not scan files with unexpected extensions.

2. **Reverse SOCKS Proxy Module**: This is a method of establishing a covert communication channel where the attacker's traffic is tunneled through a proxy server to obfuscate the origin of the traffic. This is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

Mustang Panda, a known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group, is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain long-term access to their targets. The use of the double extension trick is consistent with their known tactics. However, the use of a reverse SOCKS proxy module is not as directly associated with Mustang Panda's known TTPs. While they do use various methods to maintain persistence and evade detection, the specific use of a reverse SOCKS proxy is not a hallmark of their typical operations.

Given the options:
- **A: Yes** - This suggests that Mustang Panda would use a reverse SOCKS proxy module, which is not a primary tactic of Mustang Panda.
- **B: No** - This suggests that Mustang Panda would not use a reverse SOCKS proxy module, which is more consistent with their known tactics.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
1. The double extension trick is a known tactic of Mustang Panda.
2. Reverse SOCKS proxy is a method used to maintain persistence and evade detection, but it is not a primary tactic of Mustang Panda.
3. Given the options, the most plausible answer is that Mustang Panda would not use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy.

**Final Answer: B: No**
