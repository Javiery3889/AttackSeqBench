To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question, let's break down the steps and evaluate the answer choices.

1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. This is a common TTP where attackers use social engineering to deliver malware.

2. **Encoded PowerShell Script Execution**: The next step mentioned is the execution of an encoded PowerShell script. This is a plausible follow-up to a Word document exploit, as PowerShell can be used to execute commands and scripts on a system.

3. **VBS Macro Retrieval**: The question then mentions that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro. This is less common and less direct. Typically, once a script or payload is executed, it would not need to be retrieved again via another macro. This step seems out of place in a typical attack sequence.

4. **Download of Malware Payloads**: Finally, the question states that the VBS macro will download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. This is a plausible step, as these are known banking trojans and ransomware, respectively, and are often delivered via malicious scripts or macros.

Given the steps, the most plausible sequence would be:
1. Initial access through phishing emails.
2. Execution of an encoded PowerShell script.
3. Download of malware payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab).

The step involving the VBS macro retrieving the PowerShell script again is less plausible and does not align well with typical attack sequences.

**Final Answer: B**
