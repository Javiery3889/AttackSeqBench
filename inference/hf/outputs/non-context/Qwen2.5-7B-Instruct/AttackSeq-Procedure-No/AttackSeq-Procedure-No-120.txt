To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, let's break down the attack sequence and evaluate the likelihood of each step.

1. **Initial Access**: LYCEUM gains initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
2. **Malware Delivery**: DanBot malware is delivered via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
3. **Execution of Arbitrary Commands**: DanBot is used to execute arbitrary commands via cmd.exe.

Now, let's consider the question's specific query: "is it likely that LYCEUM would clear Linux or Mac system logs before utilizing DanBot for execution of arbitrary commands via cmd.exe?"

### Analysis:
- **LYCEUM's Motivation**: LYCEUM is known for its sophisticated and targeted approach, often focusing on stealth and avoiding detection.
- **Environment**: The question mentions Linux or Mac systems, which are different from the Windows environment where `cmd.exe` is used. DanBot is a Windows-based malware, so it would not be used on Linux or Mac systems.
- **Log Clearing**: Clearing logs is a common tactic to avoid detection, but it is more relevant in environments where the malware is expected to run natively (e.g., Windows). On Linux or Mac, the malware would not use `cmd.exe` and would not need to clear logs in the same way.

### Evaluation:
- **Answer Choice A: Yes** - This suggests that LYCEUM would clear logs on Linux or Mac systems before using DanBot. However, since DanBot is not designed to run on Linux or Mac, this step is unnecessary and unlikely.
- **Answer Choice B: No** - This suggests that LYCEUM would not clear logs on Linux or Mac systems before using DanBot. This is the more plausible option because the malware is not designed for these environments, and thus, there is no need to clear logs in a non-native environment.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the malware (DanBot) and the target environment (Linux or Mac), the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the step of clearing logs on these systems.

Final Answer: B
