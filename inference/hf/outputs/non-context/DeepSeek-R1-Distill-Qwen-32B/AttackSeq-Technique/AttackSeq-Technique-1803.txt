Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which MITRE ATT&CK technique corresponds to the scenario described. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that after receiving instructions from C2 servers, configuration files were encoded using single-byte XOR keys. The goal is to determine which technique was used to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question implies. The use of C2 servers suggests that this is a coordinated attack, likely from an external actor. The encoding of configuration files with XOR keys is a common method to obfuscate data, making it harder for defenders to analyze. Single-byte XOR is a simple form of encryption, often used by malware to hide their configuration or communication channels.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: T1547.013 - XDG Autostart Entries. This technique involves modifying autostart entries to maintain persistence. It's more about ensuring the malware runs at startup rather than disrupting services.

B: T1498 - Network Denial of Service. This is about overwhelming a network with traffic to cause disruption. It's a common method for taking down websites.

C: T1499.001 - OS Exhaustion Flood. This technique targets the operating system by exhausting resources, leading to denial of service. It's more about resource exhaustion on the OS level.

D: T1590.001 - Domain Properties. This involves modifying domain properties to gain persistence or control over network resources, not directly about disrupting services.

The question mentions disrupting websites, which points towards a denial of service attack. Between B and C, T1498 is specifically about network-level DoS, while T1499 is about OS-level resource exhaustion. Since the scenario is about disrupting websites, which are network services, T1498 seems more appropriate.

So, the most plausible answer is B: T1498-Network Denial of Service.

The scenario describes an attack where configuration files are encoded to disrupt websites, indicating a denial of service (DoS) attack. Among the options, T1498 is the technique that directly relates to network-level DoS, making it the best fit.

Final Answer: B: T1498-Network Denial of Service
