Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this cybersecurity question about the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about what happens after Grabit malware sends an HTTP request to a compromised server to download itself via a malicious macro. Then, it's asking which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to maintain persistence on the infected system.

First, I need to understand the scenario. Grabit malware uses a malicious macro, which is a common method for initial access. Once the macro runs, it sends an HTTP request to a server to download itself. So, the initial infection vector is through a macro, which is often part of a phishing email or a malicious document.

Now, the question is about persistence. Persistence is a key part of an attack where the malware ensures it can maintain access to the system even after a reboot or if the user logs out. So, after the initial infection, the malware would likely use some technique to ensure it starts up again on the next boot or when the user logs in.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1008-Fallback Channels. This technique is about maintaining redundant command and control (C2) channels. So, if the primary C2 is disrupted, the malware can switch to a backup. But the question is about persistence, not maintaining C2. So maybe not this one.

B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution. This technique involves modifying system startup processes so that the malware runs at boot or logon. Common methods include adding entries to the registry's Run keys or using scheduled tasks. This seems relevant because it's about ensuring the malware starts automatically after a reboot or logon.

C: T1546.011-Application Shimming. This is about modifying legitimate applications to execute malicious code when they run. It's more about execution rather than persistence. So, maybe not the best fit here.

D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association. This technique changes how certain file types are handled, so when a user opens a file, the malware runs. While this can be used for persistence, it's more about execution through file associations rather than ensuring the malware starts at boot or logon.

So, the question is about maintaining persistence after the initial infection. The most common methods for persistence involve starting at boot or logon, which is exactly what T1547 covers. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The question involves identifying the MITRE ATT&CK technique used by Grabit malware to maintain persistence after initial infection via a malicious macro. The key is persistence, which involves ensuring the malware runs after a reboot or logon. 

- **T1008 (Fallback Channels)** deals with maintaining C2, not persistence.
- **T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution)** directly relates to starting malware at boot or logon, fitting the persistence requirement.
- **T1546.011 (Application Shimming)** and **T1546.001 (Change Default File Association)** focus on execution through file associations or application modifications, not persistence mechanisms.

Thus, the most appropriate technique is T1547.

Final Answer: B
