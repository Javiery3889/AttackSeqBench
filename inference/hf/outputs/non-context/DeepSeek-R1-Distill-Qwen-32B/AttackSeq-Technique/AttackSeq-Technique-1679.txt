Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this cybersecurity question about the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for credential dumping and then cleared log files to hide their activity. After that, they executed processes on remote computers to spread across the network. I need to determine which ATT&CK technique this corresponds to from the given options.

First, I'll recall what Cobalt Strike Beacon does. It's a tool used by attackers for various activities like credential dumping, which is T1003.001 in ATT&CK. Then, clearing logs is T1070.001, which is part of the Adversary OPSEC. So far, that's the setup.

Now, the main part is what happens next: executing processes on remote computers to propagate. I need to think about which technique involves executing processes remotely. Let's look at the answer choices.

Option A: T1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact. That's about encrypting data to cause harm, like ransomware. Doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about propagation, not data encryption.

Option B: T1080 - Taint Shared Content. This technique involves modifying shared resources to spread malware. For example, changing a document that others access. It's more about using shared content as a vector, not directly executing processes on remote machines.

Option C: T1021 - Remote Services. This technique involves accessing remote services like RDP, SSH, or other remote sessions. Attackers might use these services to move laterally across the network by executing commands or processes on remote systems. That sounds relevant because executing processes on remote computers would likely involve using remote services.

Option D: T1583.004 - Server. I'm not too familiar with this one, but T1583 is about Server Software Component. The .004 might refer to a specific sub-technique, but I'm not sure. It might involve exploiting server software, but I'm not certain how it ties directly to executing processes on remote computers.

Putting it together, the attackers are moving laterally by executing processes on remote systems. T1021, Remote Services, seems to fit because it's about using remote access tools or services to execute commands or processes on other machines. So, the sequence would be credential dumping (T1003.001), log clearing (T1070.001), then using remote services (T1021) to propagate.

I think I'm confident that T1021 is the right answer here because it directly relates to executing processes on remote computers through services like RDP or other remote access methods.

The question involves identifying the MITRE ATT&CK technique used by attackers after credential dumping and log clearing, specifically when executing processes on remote computers to propagate. 

1. **Credential Dumping**: This is T1003.001, where attackers extract credentials from memory or files.
2. **Log Clearing**: This is T1070.001, part of OPSEC to erase traces.
3. **Propagation via Remote Execution**: The focus is on executing processes on remote systems.

Analyzing the options:
- **A (T1486)**: Relates to data encryption, not relevant here.
- **B (T1080)**: Involves modifying shared content, not direct remote execution.
- **C (T1021)**: Covers using remote services to execute commands, fitting the scenario.
- **D (T1583.004)**: Pertains to server software exploitation, less direct.

The most plausible technique is T1021, as it directly involves remote execution through services like RDP.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
