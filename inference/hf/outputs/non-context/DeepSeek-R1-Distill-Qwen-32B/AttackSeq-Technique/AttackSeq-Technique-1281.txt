Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Let me break it down step by step. 

The question is about a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack. The scenario given is that Tropic Trooper, which I think is a type of malware or attack group, used exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access. Then, the question is asking which ATT&CK technique occurred when the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment.

The answer choices are A: T1573-Encrypted Channel, B: T1564.009-Resource Forking, C: T1648-Serverless Execution, and D: T1204-User Execution.

First, I need to understand each part of the question. The initial access was via an exploit in the Equation Editor, which is a known vulnerability. Once they gained access, they deployed a backdoor. The key here is that the backdoor's installer used the user's action or interaction to trigger deployment. So, the technique in question is about how the installer was executed.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1573-Encrypted Channel. This technique is about using encrypted channels to avoid detection. It doesn't directly relate to how the installer was triggered by user interaction.

B: T1564.009-Resource Forking. This is about hiding data within resource forks of files, which is more about data storage and exfiltration rather than execution triggered by user actions.

C: T1648-Serverless Execution. This involves using serverless computing environments to execute code, which doesn't seem related to user interaction triggering an installer.

D: T1204-User Execution. This technique involves tricking a user into executing malicious code, often through social engineering or exploiting user trust. Since the question mentions leveraging users' actions or interaction, this seems relevant.

So, putting it together, the backdoor's installer was likely executed because the user took some action, like opening a document or clicking a link, which aligns with T1204-User Execution. The other options don't fit as well because they don't involve user interaction in the execution process.

The question involves identifying the MITRE ATT&CK technique used when a backdoor's installer leverages user interaction for deployment. The scenario describes Tropic Trooper using an Equation Editor exploit for initial access and then deploying a backdoor triggered by user action. 

Analyzing the options:

- **T1573 (Encrypted Channel)** deals with communication methods, not user-triggered execution.
- **T1564.009 (Resource Forking)** is about data hiding, unrelated to execution triggers.
- **T1648 (Serverless Execution)** involves cloud services, not user interaction.
- **T1204 (User Execution)** fits because it involves users executing malicious code through their actions.

Thus, the correct technique is T1204, as it directly relates to user interaction triggering the installer.

Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
