Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which MITRE ATT&CK technique comes after APT15 evades policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe to install the RoyalDNS backdoor. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that APT15 evaded policy settings that disabled the command prompt. They did this by copying and patching cmd.exe. The goal here is to facilitate the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor. So, the initial action is evading a defense mechanismâ€”specifically, a policy that disables the command prompt.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1574.013 - KernelCallbackTable. This technique involves modifying the kernel's callback tables to execute code. It's a more advanced persistence method, but I'm not sure if it's directly related to evading command prompt restrictions.

B: T1562 - Impair Defenses. This technique is about weakening security measures, like disabling security tools or modifying their configurations. Since APT15 is evading a policy that disables cmd.exe, this seems relevant because they're impairing the defense by bypassing the policy.

C: T1556.005 - Reversible Encryption. This is about using encryption that can be reversed without the key, which doesn't seem directly related to evading command prompt policies.

D: T1649 - Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates. This involves stealing or forging certificates for authentication, which doesn't fit the scenario described.

So, the key here is that APT15 is evading a policy that's meant to disable the command prompt. By copying and patching cmd.exe, they're effectively bypassing this restriction. This action falls under impairing defenses because they're weakening the existing security policy. Therefore, the most plausible next step is T1562 - Impair Defenses.

The scenario involves APT15 evading a policy that disables the command prompt by modifying cmd.exe, which is an act of weakening a security measure. This aligns with T1562, which focuses on impairing defenses. 

Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses
