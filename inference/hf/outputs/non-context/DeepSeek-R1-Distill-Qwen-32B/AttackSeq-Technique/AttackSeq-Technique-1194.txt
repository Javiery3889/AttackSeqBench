Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique comes after the BlackEnergy dropper uses a macro-enabled Word document to execute "vba_macro.exe" and build strings in memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that BlackEnergy is a known malware, often used in targeted attacks, especially in the context of energy sector attacks. It's known for using macro-based droppers, which means it uses malicious macros in documents to execute malicious code.

The question mentions that the dropper executed "vba_macro.exe" using a macro-enabled Word document. So, the initial step is the delivery of the malicious document, which is a common TTP. The macro is used to execute the dropper, which then runs some code in memory.

The next part says the dropper builds strings and runs them in memory. Building strings in memory is a technique used to avoid detection by anti-virus software because the malicious code isn't written to disk. Instead, it's executed directly from memory, which is harder to detect.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution. This technique involves modifying system startup processes to execute malicious code automatically. I'm not sure if this is the immediate next step after the dropper runs. It might be a later step for persistence.

B: T1092 - Communication Through Removable Media. This involves using removable media for data exfiltration or command and control. I don't think this is the next step after execution; it's more about communication channels.

C: T1546.012 - Image File Execution Options Injection. This technique involves modifying the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) registry key to inject a debugger into a legitimate process. This could be a way to execute code in memory, which aligns with the dropper building and running strings in memory.

D: T1095 - Non-Application Layer Protocol. This involves using protocols that don't operate at the application layer, like raw sockets or custom protocols. This seems more related to communication methods rather than the execution phase.

So, after the dropper executes and runs code in memory, the next step might involve injecting code into a legitimate process to maintain persistence or elevate privileges. T1546.012 is about injecting into processes, which fits the scenario of running strings in memory.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes after execution, the next step is to establish persistence. T1547 is about autostarting on boot or logon, which could be the next step. But the question is about what happens after the dropper runs and builds strings in memory. So, the immediate next step after execution might be process injection, which is T1546.012.

Alternatively, maybe the dropper is using reflective DLL injection or similar, which would fall under T1546.012. Reflective DLL injection is a method where a DLL is loaded into memory without writing it to disk, which matches the "build strings and run them in memory" part.

So, putting it together, the most plausible next step is T1546.012, Image File Execution Options Injection, as it involves executing code in memory through process injection.

The question involves identifying the most likely MITRE ATT&CK technique following the execution of a dropper via a macro-enabled Word document, which builds and runs strings in memory. The analysis considers the nature of the dropper's behavior and the subsequent steps in an attack sequence.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The BlackEnergy dropper uses a macro to execute "vba_macro.exe," which then builds and runs malicious code in memory. This suggests an attempt to avoid detection by not writing to disk.

2. **Evaluating Answer Choices**:
   - **A (T1547)**: Involves modifying startup processes for persistence, which is a later step.
   - **B (T1092)**: Relates to communication via removable media, not the immediate execution phase.
   - **C (T1546.012)**: Involves injecting code into legitimate processes, aligning with in-memory execution.
   - **D (T1095)**: Pertains to communication protocols, not the execution phase.

3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible next step after in-memory execution is process injection, which fits T1546.012.

Final Answer: C
