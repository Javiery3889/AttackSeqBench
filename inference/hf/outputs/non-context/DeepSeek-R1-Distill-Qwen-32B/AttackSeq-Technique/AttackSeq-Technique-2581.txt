Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which MITRE ATT&CK technique comes after the malware evaded detection using InstallUtil.exe. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware evaded detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker using InstallUtil.exe, which is a trusted .NET utility. Then, it executed its payload via proxy execution. I need to find the technique that aligns with this sequence.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1566-Phishing. Hmm, phishing is more about social engineering, tricking users into giving up info or downloading malware. Doesn't seem directly related to the execution after evasion.

B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space. This is about brute-forcing by reducing possible keys, maybe in credential theft. Not sure how this fits with the execution after evasion.

C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding. This involves encoding data in a way that's not standard, like obfuscating code. While evasion might use encoding, the question is about what happens after evasion, specifically the execution method.

D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution. This technique uses trusted tools to execute malicious code. InstallUtil.exe is a trusted utility, and using it to execute a payload via proxy fits here.

So, the malware evaded detection using a trusted utility and then executed the payload through it. That sounds exactly like T1127. The other options don't fit as well because they don't involve executing via trusted tools after evasion.

The malware evaded detection using a trusted utility and executed the payload via proxy, which aligns with T1127. 

Final Answer: D
