Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to iterate through password stores and steal Google Chrome credentials after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts to download additional malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The question describes an attack sequence where the backdoor evades defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts. This suggests that the malware is using a common technique to execute malicious code without being detected by traditional antivirus software. Once it's decoded, it downloads additional malware, which implies that the initial payload is just a downloader or a first-stage backdoor.

Now, the question is about whether this backdoor would then proceed to steal Google Chrome credentials by iterating through password stores. I know that many backdoors and malware have different objectives. Some are designed to gather information, others to exfiltrate data, and some might be part of a larger attack chain.

Dropping Elephant, as I recall, is a backdoor that's been associated with various cyber espionage campaigns. Its primary functions typically include establishing persistence, enabling remote control, and exfiltrating data. However, I'm not sure if it specifically targets browser credentials like Chrome's.

I should consider the MITRE ATT&CK framework to see what techniques are associated with credential theft. Credential Access (TA0006) includes tactics like OS Credential Dumping (T1003) and Browser Cookie Theft (T1539). If Dropping Elephant uses these techniques, then it's more likely to steal credentials.

But wait, the initial step was about evading defenses and downloading more malware. That might mean the backdoor is setting up for further actions. Stealing credentials could be a subsequent step, but is it the immediate next step after downloading additional malware?

I should also think about the typical behavior of backdoors. Some backdoors might immediately look for credentials to escalate privileges or move laterally within a network. Others might wait for a command from the attacker. If Dropping Elephant is designed to steal credentials, it would likely do so as part of its operational phase.

However, the question is whether it's "likely" to do so. Without specific intelligence that Dropping Elephant specifically targets Chrome credentials, I might lean towards it being less likely. But given that many backdoors do target browser data, it's plausible.

Wait, but the question is about the sequence. After evading defenses and downloading malware, the next step could be credential theft. So, if the malware is designed to gather information, it's possible. But if the primary function is to establish a backdoor, maybe the credential theft comes later.

I'm a bit torn. On one hand, it's a common tactic to steal credentials after gaining access. On the other hand, without specific info on Dropping Elephant's behavior, I can't be certain. But the question is about likelihood based on the attack sequence described.

In the context of the question, the backdoor has already evaded defenses and downloaded more malware. The next logical step for many attackers would be to gather credentials to move laterally or exfiltrate data. So, it's plausible that it would iterate through password stores.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is yes because it's a common step, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because the initial steps are about establishing a foothold, and credential theft might come later, not necessarily immediately after downloading malware.

Wait, the question is whether it's "likely" to do so. Given that many backdoors do this, I think the answer is yes. So, I'll go with A: Yes.

The scenario involves the Dropping Elephant backdoor evading defenses and downloading additional malware. Considering common attack behaviors, credential theft is a typical next step to facilitate further attacks. While specific intelligence on Dropping Elephant's behavior isn't provided, the likelihood of it stealing Chrome credentials is plausible based on common tactics.

Final Answer: A
