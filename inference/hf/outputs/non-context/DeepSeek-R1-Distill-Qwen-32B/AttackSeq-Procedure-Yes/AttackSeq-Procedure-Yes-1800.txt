Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers used two different single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files, and if that leads to them launching DDoS attacks against certain websites. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that XOR encryption is a common method used to obfuscate data. Using a single-byte key means the encryption is relatively simple, but it's still effective for basic obfuscation. The fact that two different keys were used suggests that the attackers might be trying to avoid detection by varying their encryption methods. This could make it harder for defenders to decrypt the configuration files without knowing both keys.

Now, the question mentions that FireEye observed this. FireEye is a well-known cybersecurity firm, so their observation adds credibility to the scenario. They probably detected these keys during an analysis of the attack campaign.

The next part is about the DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, specifically causing Next Media's network to fail. DDoS attacks are a common tactic in cyber campaigns, especially those with political motives. The use of two XOR keys could be part of the command and control (C2) communication process. The configuration files might contain instructions for the bots or compromised devices to launch the DDoS attacks.

So, putting it together: the attackers used XOR encryption with two different keys to encode their configuration files, which were issued by the DDoS C2 servers. This would allow them to control the botnet and direct it to target specific websites. The observed use of two keys suggests a level of sophistication, as they're trying to avoid detection by varying their encryption. This makes it more likely that they successfully launched the DDoS attacks, leading to the failure of Next Media's network.

I don't see any immediate contradictions here. The use of encryption in C2 communication is standard, and varying the keys can help evade detection. Therefore, it's plausible that the attackers used these techniques to carry out the DDoS attacks as described.

The use of two different single-byte XOR keys by the attackers to encode configuration files suggests a method to obfuscate their activities and avoid detection. This technique is consistent with the tactics used in cyber campaigns, particularly those with political motives. FireEye's observation adds credibility to the scenario, indicating that the attackers likely used these encrypted configurations to direct DDoS attacks. The subsequent failure of Next Media's network aligns with the expected outcome of such attacks. Therefore, the sequence of events is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
