Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Lazarus group, after using backdoor malware to communicate with their command-and-control servers and execute remote commands, would likely deploy Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, disrupting the bank's operations during the heist. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the context. The Lazarus group is known for various cyberattacks, including those against financial institutions. They often use backdoor malware to gain access and control over systems. Once they have that access, they can execute various commands remotely.

Now, the question is about whether they would deploy Hermes ransomware specifically to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backups. I know that ransomware typically encrypts files and demands a ransom, but some ransomware variants also delete backups to prevent data recovery. Volume Shadow Copies are used for system restore points, so deleting them would make it harder for the victim to recover without paying the ransom.

Hermes ransomware, as I recall, is associated with the Lazarus group. They used it in attacks, particularly against financial institutions. The purpose of using such ransomware would be to disrupt operations and cause financial loss, which aligns with the group's objectives in heists.

So, putting it together: After establishing a backdoor, using it to execute commands, deploying ransomware that deletes backups makes sense as part of their attack strategy to maximize disruption and potential for ransom payment. Therefore, the answer is likely A: Yes.

The Lazarus group, known for targeting financial institutions, uses backdoor malware to gain system access and execute commands. Deploying Hermes ransomware, which deletes Volume Shadow Copies and backups, aligns with their strategy to disrupt operations and increase the likelihood of ransom payment. 

Final Answer: A
