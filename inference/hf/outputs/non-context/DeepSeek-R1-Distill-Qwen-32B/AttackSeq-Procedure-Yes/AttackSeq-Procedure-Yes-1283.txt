Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process after using Equation Editor exploits. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Equation Editor exploits are often used in phishing attacks, especially in documents like Word or Excel files. These exploits can execute malicious code, like an installer package, which is mentioned here. So the initial step is clear: the exploit delivers the installer, which has malicious payloads.

Now, the question is about the next steps. The user is asking if Tropic Trooper would use FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe and then inject a malicious DLL backdoor. I need to recall what I know about Tropic Trooper's tactics.

Tropic Trooper, also known as APT32 or OceanLotus, is a Vietnamese cyber espionage group. They're known for using various tools and techniques. From what I remember, they've used custom backdoors and loaders in their attacks. FakeRun is a loader that's been associated with them. It's designed to execute malicious payloads in a way that's harder to detect.

Dllhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process used for hosting DLLs. Attackers often inject malicious DLLs into legitimate processes to hide their activities. So, if Tropic Trooper uses FakeRun, it might be to execute a legitimate-looking process like dllhost.exe, which then gets the malicious DLL injected into it. This would help them maintain persistence and execute their backdoor without being easily detected.

Looking at the sequence: Equation Editor exploit → installer package → FakeRun loader → dllhost.exe → inject malicious DLL. This makes sense because each step is a common technique in APT attacks. The exploit delivers the initial payload, which then uses a loader to execute a legitimate process, and then injects the malicious code into it for persistence.

I don't recall any specific information that contradicts this sequence for Tropic Trooper. Their modus operandi does include using such loaders and process injection techniques. So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, this sequence is plausible.

The sequence described aligns with Tropic Trooper's known tactics, which include using loaders like FakeRun to execute legitimate processes and inject malicious DLLs for persistence.
