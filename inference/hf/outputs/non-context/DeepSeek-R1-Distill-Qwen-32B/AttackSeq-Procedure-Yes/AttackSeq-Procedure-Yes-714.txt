Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload after being injected via a malicious macro in Word. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that initial access is achieved by injecting the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word through a malicious macro. I know that Sharpshooter is a type of downloader, often used in phishing attacks. It's designed to deliver other malicious payloads. So, the initial step here is the use of a macro in a Word document to execute Sharpshooter.

Now, the next part is about the Rising Sun implant. I'm not exactly sure what Rising Sun refers to, but given the context, it's likely another piece of malware. The question is whether this implant will download a second-stage payload to act as a downloader for further malicious activities.

In typical attack sequences, after initial access, attackers often use a downloader to fetch additional tools or payloads. Sharpshooter itself is a downloader, so it might download the Rising Sun implant. Once Rising Sun is on the system, it might then download more tools or payloads to carry out the attack objectives, like data exfiltration, lateral movement, etc.

So, the sequence would be: Malicious macro executes Sharpshooter, which downloads Rising Sun. Then, Rising Sun might download another payload. Therefore, it's plausible that Rising Sun would act as a downloader for subsequent activities.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the typical behavior of such malware, the answer should be A: Yes.

The scenario involves a malicious macro in a Word document executing the Sharpshooter downloader, which then likely downloads the Rising Sun implant. Given that Sharpshooter is a known downloader, it's reasonable to assume it would retrieve Rising Sun. Subsequently, Rising Sun, as part of a typical attack chain, would likely download further payloads for malicious activities. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
