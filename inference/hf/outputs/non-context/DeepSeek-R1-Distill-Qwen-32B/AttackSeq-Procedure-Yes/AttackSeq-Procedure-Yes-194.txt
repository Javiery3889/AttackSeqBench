Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SparrowDoor, after being executed via cmd.exe commands, will communicate with the C&C server using an encrypted HTTPS channel. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that SparrowDoor is a type of malware, specifically a backdoor. Backdoors are used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system. They often communicate with command and control (C&C) servers to receive instructions or exfiltrate data.

The question mentions that the initial access was gained through exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. That makes sense because such vulnerabilities are common entry points for attackers. Once they have initial access, they execute commands, in this case, running cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor. So SparrowDoor is the payload that's being used to establish a backdoor.

Now, the key part is whether SparrowDoor communicates via an encrypted HTTPS channel. I remember that many modern malware use encryption to avoid detection. HTTPS is a common method because it's widely used and can blend in with normal traffic, making it harder for network monitoring tools to detect malicious activity.

I should consider how SparrowDoor operates. From what I recall, SparrowDoor is designed to be stealthy. It uses legitimate tools and protocols to communicate. Using HTTPS would fit this profile because it's encrypted and doesn't raise red flags. Additionally, using HTTPS can help the malware avoid detection by firewalls or intrusion detection systems that might flag unencrypted traffic.

Another point is that encrypted communication channels are standard in many APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) and sophisticated malware. They need to maintain persistence and avoid being caught, so encryption is a must. SparrowDoor, being a backdoor, likely needs to stay undetected for as long as possible, which supports the use of HTTPS.

I don't think SparrowDoor would use an unencrypted channel because that would be too risky. Unencrypted traffic is easier to monitor and block, which would compromise the attacker's ability to control the infected system. So, using HTTPS makes the most sense for both functionality and stealth.

Therefore, putting it all together, SparrowDoor is likely to use an encrypted HTTPS channel for command and control after being executed.

SparrowDoor, as a stealthy backdoor malware, is designed to maintain persistent access and avoid detection. After being executed via cmd.exe, it would likely use an encrypted HTTPS channel for communication with the C&C server. This choice aligns with common practices in malware to ensure stealth and persistence, making encrypted communication the most plausible method.

Final Answer: A: Yes
