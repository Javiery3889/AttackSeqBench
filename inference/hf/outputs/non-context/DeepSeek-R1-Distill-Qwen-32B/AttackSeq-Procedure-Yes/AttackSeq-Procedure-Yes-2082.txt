Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting them to its landing page. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what RIG EK is. From what I remember, RIG EK stands for RIG Exploit Kit. Exploit kits are toolkits that attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities in software, usually to deliver malware. RIG EK is known for targeting browser vulnerabilities, which makes sense because browsers are common entry points for attacks.

The question mentions that after using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands and obtain capabilities, RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits. So, the scenario is about the sequence of actions RIG EK takes during an attack.

The options are whether RIG EK would first redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before going to the landing page. So, the question is about the attack vector or the initial delivery method.

I recall that exploit kits often use malvertising as a distribution method. Malvertising involves embedding malicious code in online advertisements. When a user clicks on or is redirected through these ads, they can be sent to a landing page that hosts the exploit kit.

RIG EK, in particular, has been associated with malvertising campaigns. Attackers use compromised websites or ad networks to distribute their malicious ads. When a user visits a site with these ads, they might be redirected through several steps before reaching the exploit landing page. This multi-step redirection is common to avoid detection and to target specific vulnerabilities.

So, the sequence would be: user visits a legitimate site with malicious ads (malvertising), gets redirected to a compromised site or an ad page, and then to the exploit kit's landing page where the actual exploit is delivered. This landing page then uses browser vulnerabilities to execute commands and gain access.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, RIG EK is likely to use this method. It aligns with how exploit kits typically operate, using malvertising as a vector to deliver their payloads.

RIG EK is known to utilize malvertising as a distribution method. Attackers use malicious ads on legitimate or compromised sites to redirect users through several steps before reaching the exploit landing page. This approach helps avoid detection and targets specific vulnerabilities. Thus, RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits via this sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
