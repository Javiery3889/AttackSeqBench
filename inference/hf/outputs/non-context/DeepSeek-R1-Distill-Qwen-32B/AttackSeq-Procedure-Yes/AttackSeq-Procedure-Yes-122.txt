Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Agrius exploited public-facing applications using a vulnerability, specifically CVE-2018-13379. I remember that CVE-2018-13379 is related to a remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server. Exploiting such a vulnerability would likely give the attacker initial access to the system. So that makes sense as the starting point.

Next, the question says that after gaining initial access, Agrius uses webshells for tunneling RDP traffic. Webshells are malicious scripts that provide a way for attackers to maintain access and control over a compromised server. Using a webshell, an attacker can execute commands on the server. Tunneling RDP traffic through a webshell would allow the attacker to remotely access the system using RDP, which is a common method for lateral movement within a network. So this step seems plausible because webshells are often used for such purposes.

Then, the question states that Agrius leverages compromised accounts for lateral movement. Once an attacker has initial access, they often look for credentials or compromise existing user accounts to move laterally within the network. This is a standard tactic in cyber attacks, as it allows them to access other systems without being detected. So this step also makes sense.

Finally, the question mentions that Agrius communicates with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP. I'm not as familiar with 'IPsec Helper,' but I know that backdoors are used to maintain persistent access to a compromised system. If the backdoor uses HTTP, it might blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect. This seems like a reasonable step after establishing a foothold and moving laterally.

Putting it all together, the sequence starts with exploiting a vulnerability for initial access, uses webshells to tunnel RDP for remote access, moves laterally using compromised accounts, and then uses a backdoor to communicate with the command and control server. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and each TTP is commonly used in cyber attacks. Therefore, the answer should be that this sequence is likely.

The sequence described follows a logical progression of attack steps: exploiting a vulnerability for initial access, using webshells for remote access, leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement, and employing a backdoor for C2 communication. Each step aligns with common TTPs in cyber attacks.

Final Answer: A: Yes
