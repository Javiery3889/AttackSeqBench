Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the answer to this question is A: Yes or B: No. The question is about a sequence of cyber attack techniques. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that before attackers used heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode payload, they likely inserted malicious JavaScript into a Korean-language news portal. This JavaScript was meant to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

I need to determine if this sequence makes sense. Let me recall what each of these terms means.

Heap spraying is a technique used in exploit development where attackers fill the memory heap with a specific pattern or code. This is often done to increase the chances of a successful exploit by ensuring that the exploit lands in a predictable location in memory. Once the heap is sprayed, the attacker can trigger a vulnerability to execute their payload, which in this case is shellcode.

CVE-2019-13720 is a vulnerability in Google Chrome. I think it's a use-after-free vulnerability, which means that the browser doesn't properly handle memory after an object has been freed, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

So, the attack sequence described is: malicious JavaScript is inserted into a news portal. When a victim visits the site, the JavaScript redirects them to an exploit landing page. This landing page then uses the CVE-2019-13720 vulnerability to exploit the victim's Chrome browser. Once the exploit is successful, the attackers use heap spraying to gain control over the system, allowing them to execute their payload.

Now, does this sequence make sense? Let me think about how such attacks typically work. Usually, the process is:

1. The attacker compromises a website (like a news portal) and injects malicious code, often JavaScript, which is commonly used because it runs in the browser and can be used to redirect or execute scripts without needing to download anything.

2. When a victim visits the compromised site, the JavaScript runs and redirects them to a server controlled by the attacker, which hosts the exploit.

3. The exploit landing page contains code that takes advantage of a specific vulnerability, like CVE-2019-13720. This exploit would cause the browser to execute arbitrary code, often through a use-after-free vulnerability, which can lead to memory corruption.

4. Once the exploit is successful, the attacker might use techniques like heap spraying to set up the environment for executing their payload. Heap spraying is often used in conjunction with exploits to increase the reliability of the exploit by ensuring that the shellcode is in a predictable location.

So, putting it all together, the sequence described in the question seems plausible. The malicious JavaScript redirects the user to the exploit page, which then uses the vulnerability to execute code, and then heap spraying is used to facilitate the execution of the payload.

Wait, but does the heap spraying come before or after the exploit? I think heap spraying is part of the exploit process. The exploit would trigger the vulnerability, and then the heap spraying would be used to control the memory space to execute the shellcode. So the sequence would be: JavaScript redirect → exploit using CVE-2019-13720 → heap spraying to execute payload.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes, because the sequence makes sense. The malicious JavaScript is the initial vector, leading to the exploit, which then uses heap spraying to execute the payload.

I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. The steps follow a logical order of attack, starting from initial compromise, redirection, exploit, and then payload execution.
</think>

The sequence described in the question follows a logical and plausible attack process. The malicious JavaScript serves as the initial vector, redirecting victims to an exploit landing page. The exploit then leverages the CVE-2019-13720 vulnerability in Google Chrome, which is a use-after-free flaw. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code, at which point heap spraying is employed to ensure the payload's successful execution. This sequence aligns with typical exploit techniques, making the scenario likely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
