Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in question is likely to create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question describes a sequence of events. The malware is delivered via 'Thu moi.7z', which contains 'Thumoi.hta'. When executed, this HTA file runs a VB Script. The VB Script then drops a decoy Microsoft Word file. So far, this makes sense because attackers often use decoys to distract the user or to avoid suspicion.

Now, the next part is about the malware rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder. The filename is randomized using a Hex-filename and has a '.tmp' extension. This is a common tactic because the Temp folder is often overlooked, and using a .tmp extension makes the file less suspicious. Randomizing the filename also helps avoid detection by security software that might be looking for specific filenames.

The question is whether, after this self-rewriting, the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file. So, I need to think about how malware typically behaves after dropping its payload.

Malware often uses process injection or creates new processes to execute malicious code. Creating a new process can help the malware run its payload without being detected, as it can blend in with legitimate processes. Alternatively, it might inject code into an existing process, but creating a new one is also plausible.

In this case, the malware has already executed the VB Script, which dropped the decoy and presumably the malicious payload. The next logical step would be to execute that payload. Since the payload is an .exe file, it's likely that the malware would create a new process to run it. This is because executing an .exe typically requires a new process, especially if the current process (like the HTA or VB Script) isn't suited for running executables directly.

Additionally, using the %Temp% folder and a .tmp extension is a way to hide the malicious file, but once it's there, the malware needs to execute it. Creating a new process would allow the malware to run the .exe file, which could then carry out further malicious activities, such as establishing persistence, stealing data, or downloading additional payloads.

I don't see any reason why the malware wouldn't execute the .exe file after dropping it. It's a standard part of the infection process. So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, it's likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped .exe file.

The malware, after delivering itself via 'Thu moi.7z' and executing the VB Script, drops a decoy file and rewrites itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension. This behavior is typical for evading detection. The next logical step is to execute the malicious payload, which is an .exe file. Malware often creates a new process to run such executables, ensuring the payload can execute without being detected. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped .exe file.

Final Answer: A: Yes
