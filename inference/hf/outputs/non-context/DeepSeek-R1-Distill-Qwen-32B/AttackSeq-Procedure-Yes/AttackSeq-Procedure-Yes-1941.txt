Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Smooth Operator malware will automatically exfiltrate data using a HTTP GET request after establishing communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and using a custom encoding algorithm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware communicates with its command and control (C2) servers over HTTPS. That makes sense because HTTPS is secure and helps avoid detection by using encryption. Then, it uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. Obfuscation is a common tactic to hide malicious activities from network monitoring tools.

Now, the question is about whether it will use a HTTP GET request for exfiltration. I know that HTTP GET is a common method for data transfer, but it's not encrypted, unlike HTTPS. If the malware is already using HTTPS for communication, it might prefer to stick with that for exfiltration to maintain the same level of security and avoid detection.

Also, using a custom encoding algorithm suggests that the malware is trying to hide its data. If it switches to HTTP GET, which is unencrypted, it might expose the data, defeating the purpose of the custom encoding. It's more likely that the malware would continue using HTTPS for exfiltration to keep the data hidden and secure.

So, putting it all together, the malware probably wouldn't switch to an unencrypted HTTP GET request after already using HTTPS and custom encoding. It makes more sense for it to stick with HTTPS for exfiltration to maintain stealth and data integrity.

The Smooth Operator malware uses HTTPS and custom encoding to maintain stealth. Switching to an unencrypted HTTP GET request for exfiltration would expose data, contradicting its use of encryption and obfuscation. Therefore, it's unlikely to use HTTP GET for exfiltration.

Final Answer: B: No
