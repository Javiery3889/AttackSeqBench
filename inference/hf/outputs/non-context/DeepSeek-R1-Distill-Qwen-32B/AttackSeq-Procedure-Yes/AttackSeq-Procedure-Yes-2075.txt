Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether RIG Exploit Kit (EK) delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand what RIG EK is. From what I remember, RIG EK is a well-known exploit kit that's been used in various cyberattacks. It's primarily used to distribute malware, often through drive-by downloads, where users are redirected to malicious sites without their knowledge.

Malvertising is a tactic where attackers use malicious ads to distribute malware. So, if RIG EK uses malvertising, that would mean they inject malicious code into legitimate advertising networks. When a user clicks on these ads or even just views them, they get redirected to a compromised site.

Now, the question mentions that after redirection, an obfuscated PowerShell script is run. Obfuscating scripts is a common technique to avoid detection by antivirus software. PowerShell is a powerful tool, and attackers often use it to execute commands or download additional malware. The Command and Scripting Interpreter tactic in MITRE ATT&CK refers to using legitimate tools like PowerShell to carry out malicious activities.

Putting this together, RIG EK's modus operandi involves exploiting vulnerabilities, often through malvertising. They redirect users to sites that host exploit code. Once the user is on the compromised site, the exploit kit delivers the payload, which could involve using scripts like PowerShell to download the actual malware.

I think RIG EK does use malvertising as a distribution method. They've been known to leverage ad networks to spread their exploits. The use of obfuscated PowerShell scripts aligns with their tactics to execute malicious activities stealthily. So, the sequence described in the question—malvertising redirect, followed by a PowerShell script fetching malware—seems accurate for RIG EK.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

RIG Exploit Kit (EK) is known for using malvertising to redirect users to compromised sites, where it employs obfuscated PowerShell scripts to fetch malware. This aligns with the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: A
