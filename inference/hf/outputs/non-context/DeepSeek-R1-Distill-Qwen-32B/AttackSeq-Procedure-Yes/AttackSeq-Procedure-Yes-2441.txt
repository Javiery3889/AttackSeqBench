Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Elise malware, after collecting system information, is likely to communicate with a hardcoded C2 server using an application layer protocol. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that in cybersecurity, especially when dealing with malware, the process usually involves several stages. The question mentions that Elise has already performed discovery by collecting system info like IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration. That makes sense because the first step for malware is often to understand the environment it's in.

Now, after discovery, the next logical step is communication with a command and control (C2) server. C2 servers are where attackers send commands to the malware and receive data from it. The question specifies that the C2 server is hardcoded at 103.236.150[.]14. Hardcoding C2 domains or IPs is a common technique, though it's less stealthy because if the server is taken down, the malware can't communicate anymore. But it's still a straightforward method.

The next part is about the protocol used. The question asks if it's likely to use an application layer protocol. Application layer protocols are those that operate at the top of the OSI model, like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. These are used for sending data between applications, so they're perfect for C2 because they can blend in with normal traffic.

Malware often uses HTTP or HTTPS because they're allowed through most firewalls and are common in networks. Using such protocols makes the communication less suspicious. So, if Elise is using a hardcoded C2 server, it's very plausible that it's using an application layer protocol to send the collected information back to the attackers.

I don't see any reason why it wouldn't use such a protocol. If it didn't, it might use lower-level protocols, but that's less common and more likely to be detected. So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes.

After Elise malware collects system information, it is logical for it to communicate with a hardcoded C2 server using an application layer protocol like HTTP or HTTPS to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
