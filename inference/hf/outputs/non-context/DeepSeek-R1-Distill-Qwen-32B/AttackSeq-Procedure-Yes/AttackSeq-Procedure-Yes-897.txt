Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Office document in the question would contain an image instructing the victim to enable macros and then use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that KerrDown is delivered via malicious Office documents with macros or RAR archives using DLL side-loading. So, the initial delivery vector is either a macro-enabled Office document or a RAR file that triggers DLL side-loading.

Now, the question is about whether the Office document would have an image telling the victim to enable macros. I know that in many phishing attacks, especially those using macros, the document often includes a prompt or image instructing the user to enable macros to view the content properly. This is a common social engineering tactic to trick the user into enabling macros, which then execute the malicious code.

Next, the question mentions using base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture. Base64 encoding is a way to encode binary data, often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The payload would need to check the system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) to determine which version of the payload to execute. This makes sense because different architectures require different binaries.

Putting it together, the Office document would likely have an image instructing the user to enable macros. Once macros are enabled, the embedded code would decode the base64 payload, check the system architecture, and execute the appropriate malicious code. This sequence aligns with typical attack patterns where social engineering is used to bypass initial defenses, followed by payload execution tailored to the target's environment.

So, considering all this, the answer should be yes, it's likely that the Office document contains such an image and uses base64 blobs as described.

The Office document in question is likely to include an image instructing the user to enable macros, a common tactic in phishing attacks. Once macros are enabled, the document would decode a base64-encoded payload, which would then execute based on the system's architecture. This sequence is consistent with typical attack methods.

Final Answer: A: Yes
