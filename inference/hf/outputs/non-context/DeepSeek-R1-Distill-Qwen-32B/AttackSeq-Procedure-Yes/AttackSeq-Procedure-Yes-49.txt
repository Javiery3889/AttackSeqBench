Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the scenario described is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question says that initial access was gained through phishing emails with a malicious Word document. I know that phishing emails are a common method for attackers to deliver malware. The Word document likely contains a macro, which is a common technique because many users have macros enabled by default.

The next part mentions an encoded PowerShell script retrieved via a VBS macro. I remember that VBS (Visual Basic Script) macros are often used in these attacks because they can execute other scripts. Encoding the PowerShell script is a way to obfuscate it, making it harder for antivirus software to detect. So, the macro would probably decode the PowerShell script and execute it.

Now, the PowerShell script is supposed to download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab. I know that Ursnif is a banking Trojan, and GandCrab is a ransomware. Both are known to be distributed through such methods. Attackers often use PowerShell because it's a powerful tool that can perform a wide range of tasks, including downloading and executing malicious files.

Putting it all together: Phishing email → malicious Word document → VBS macro executes → encoded PowerShell is decoded and runs → downloads malware. This sequence makes sense because each step is a common tactic in cyberattacks. The use of encoded scripts and macros is typical to bypass security measures.

So, considering all this, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The scenario describes a typical cyberattack sequence where a phishing email delivers a malicious Word document. The VBS macro within the document executes an encoded PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade detection. This script then downloads known malware like Ursnif and GandCrab, aligning with common attack tactics. 

Final Answer: A
