Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the answer to this question is A: Yes or B: No. The question is about whether the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which communicates over HTTP and does things like updating relays or downloading files, would likely lead to the deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' that later become ransomware to destroy data.

First, I need to understand the components involved. The 'IPsec Helper' is a backdoor, which means it's a tool used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system. It communicates with command and control (C2) servers over HTTP, which is a common method for such backdoors. The activities mentioned—updating relays and downloading files—suggest that the attackers are using this backdoor to manage their operations, possibly distributing additional tools or malware.

Now, the question is about whether this leads to the deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' that turn into ransomware. Wipers are malware designed to destroy data, often by overwriting files or making them unrecoverable. Ransomware, on the other hand, encrypts files and demands payment for decryption. Sometimes, attackers use wipers to make data unrecoverable if the ransom isn't paid, which can escalate the attack.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, I know that backdoors like 'IPsec Helper' fall under techniques such as Persistence (T1552) and Command and Control (T1573). The use of HTTP for C2 is a common tactic (T1573.001). The activities mentioned, like updating relays and downloading files, are part of the initial access and lateral movement phases.

Now, considering the progression of an attack, after establishing a backdoor and maintaining persistence, attackers often move laterally within the network, gather information, and then deploy additional payloads. Deploying wipers or ransomware is a common next step, especially in targeted attacks where the goal is data destruction or financial gain.

The 'Apostle' wiper, if it's later turned into ransomware, suggests that the attackers might have intended to destroy data but then decided to monetize the attack by adding ransomware functionality. This is plausible because some cybercriminal groups have been known to evolve their tools to maximize their gains.

So, putting it all together, the sequence makes sense: using a backdoor to maintain access, then deploying more destructive tools like wipers that can evolve into ransomware. Therefore, the answer is likely A: Yes.

The question involves determining whether the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which communicates over HTTP and facilitates activities like updating relays and downloading files, would likely lead to the deployment of wipers such as 'Apostle' that later become ransomware. 

Analyzing the scenario, the 'IPsec Helper' serves as a backdoor for maintaining access and managing operations, which aligns with MITRE ATT&CK techniques for persistence and command and control. Attackers often progress from establishing a backdoor to deploying more destructive payloads, such as wipers or ransomware, to achieve their objectives. The evolution of 'Apostle' into ransomware is plausible as cybercriminals may adapt their tools to maximize financial gain.

Thus, the sequence of events described is consistent with typical attack progression, making the answer:

Final Answer: A: Yes
