Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Dropping Elephant, which I think is a cyber threat group, would use a UPX packed backdoor to download PowerShell scripts and then use encoded blobs for defense evasion after gaining access through spear-phishing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the initial access is through spear-phishing emails exploiting specific CVEs, like CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352. I remember that these CVEs are related to Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, specifically in how they handle certain objects, which can lead to remote code execution. So, the attackers are likely using these vulnerabilities to deliver their payload.

Now, the next part is about using a UPX packed backdoor. UPX is a common tool for packing executables to make them smaller and sometimes to evade detection. So, if the backdoor is packed with UPX, it's probably to avoid being detected by antivirus or other security software. That makes sense because attackers often use packers to obfuscate their malicious code.

After that, the backdoor is supposed to download PowerShell command line scripts. PowerShell is a powerful tool in Windows environments, often used by attackers because it's legitimate and can perform a wide range of tasks without needing to write to the disk, which helps in evading detection. So, using PowerShell scripts makes sense as a next step because it allows the attackers to execute commands and download further payloads or tools.

Then, the question mentions employing encoded blobs for defense evasion. Encoded blobs could refer to obfuscated or encrypted data that's used to hide malicious code or commands. This is a common technique to prevent security tools from detecting the malicious activity. For example, attackers might encode their commands in a way that's not easily readable, making it harder for defenders to spot the malicious intent.

Putting it all together, the sequence would be: initial access via spear-phishing exploiting CVEs, using a UPX-packed backdoor to deliver the payload stealthily, then using PowerShell scripts to execute further commands, and finally using encoded blobs to hide their activities and evade detection.

I should check if Dropping Elephant is known to use these specific techniques. From what I recall, Dropping Elephant, also known as APT29 or the GRU's Unit 26165, is known for using sophisticated techniques. They often use spear-phishing with malicious documents exploiting vulnerabilities, use custom backdoors, and employ various evasion techniques. They have been observed using PowerShell for command execution and have used obfuscation methods to hide their activities.

So, the sequence described in the question aligns with their known tactics. They would likely use a UPX-packed backdoor to deliver the initial payload, then use PowerShell scripts to execute commands, and then employ encoded blobs to evade detection. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The sequence described aligns with the known tactics of Dropping Elephant, who are known to use spear-phishing, UPX-packed backdoors, PowerShell scripts, and encoded blobs for evasion.
