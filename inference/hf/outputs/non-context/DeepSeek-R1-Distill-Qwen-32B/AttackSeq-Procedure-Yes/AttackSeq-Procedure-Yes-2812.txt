Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Derusbi malware, after gathering system information and sending it to the C2 via port 443, is likely to use HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I know that Derusbi is a type of malware, often associated with espionage activities. It's known for its use of HTTP for communication, which makes sense because port 443 is typically used for HTTPS, which is common for web traffic. Using port 443 helps the malware blend in with normal traffic, making it harder to detect.

Now, the question mentions HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication. Obfuscation is a common tactic to hide malicious traffic. So, if Derusbi is using HTTP, it's likely that it's obfuscating its data to avoid detection by firewalls or IDS/IPS systems. That makes sense because without obfuscation, the traffic might be more easily spotted.

Next, the specific endpoint mentioned is /photos/photo.asp. I'm not exactly sure about Derusbi's exact C2 communication patterns, but I know that some malware uses legitimate-looking URLs to disguise their C2 traffic. For example, using a path like /photos/photo.asp could make the traffic look like it's part of a legitimate web service, which would help in evading detection. So, it's plausible that Derusbi uses such a path.

Putting it all together, Derusbi likely uses HTTP beaconing over port 443, employs obfuscation to hide its communications, and uses specific endpoints like /photos/photo.asp to make its traffic appear benign. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The Derusbi malware is known for using HTTP communication over port 443 to blend into normal traffic. It employs obfuscation to hide its data, making detection harder. Using a path like /photos/photo.asp helps disguise its C2 traffic as legitimate. Therefore, it's plausible that Derusbi uses these tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
