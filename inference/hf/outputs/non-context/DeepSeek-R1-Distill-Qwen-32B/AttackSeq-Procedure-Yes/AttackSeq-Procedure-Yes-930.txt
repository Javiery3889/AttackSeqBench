Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Explosive Trojan would use writable mass storage devices for lateral movement after gaining admin passwords. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the Trojan uses keylogging to get admin passwords during Credential Access. That makes sense because keyloggers are a common method for stealing credentials. Once they have those credentials, the next step is lateral movement, which is moving within the network to access more systems.

The question then asks if the Trojan would use writable USB devices for lateral movement. I know that some malware uses USB drives to spread because they can be easily plugged into other machines, especially in environments where USB usage is common. So, using a USB infection option could be a way to move laterally within the network.

After lateral movement, the question mentions a multi-tiered server backend for Command and Control (C2). That sounds like a more sophisticated setup where the malware communicates with multiple servers, possibly to avoid detection or to handle larger-scale operations.

Now, looking at the answer choices, it's a yes or no question. I think the sequence makes sense because after gaining access, using USB for lateral movement is plausible, and then setting up a robust C2 framework would follow. So, the answer should be yes.

The sequence described is logical: after obtaining admin credentials, using USB devices for lateral movement is plausible, followed by establishing a multi-tiered C2 framework. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
