Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection after using malicious macros and a backdoor. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware uses malicious macros in existing documents for persistence. I know that malicious macros are often used to execute code when a document is opened, which can help maintain persistence on a compromised system. So, the initial infection vector is through these macros.

Next, the malware uses a backdoor to list interesting files, specifically Office documents, during the discovery phase. This makes sense because attackers often look for documents that might contain sensitive information or could be used for further attacks. Listing Office documents is a common step in data collection.

Now, the question is whether the malware will then scan all drives, including network shares, for sensitive data. I'm thinking about the typical behavior of malware, especially in the context of data exfiltration. Once an attacker has a foothold, they usually want to gather as much information as possible. Scanning all drives, including network shares, would allow them to find more sensitive data beyond just the local machine.

Gamaredon is known to be a threat group associated with espionage activities, so their malware is likely designed to gather extensive information. They would want to access not just local files but also those on network drives, which might contain more valuable or sensitive data.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the behavior described—using persistence, a backdoor for discovery, and the nature of Gamaredon's activities—it seems plausible that the malware would indeed scan all drives, including network shares, to collect sensitive data.

I don't see any reason why they wouldn't do that. It's a logical next step in data collection after establishing persistence and initial discovery. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The malware, after establishing persistence through malicious macros and using a backdoor for initial discovery, is likely to scan all drives, including network shares, to gather sensitive data, aligning with Gamaredon's espionage objectives.

Final Answer: A
