Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether PROMETHIUM, after collecting Microsoft Office files, would encode them with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before sending them to the C2 server. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that in the Collection phase, malware often gathers sensitive information. PROMETHIUM is using a document search module to find and compress Office files. That makes sense because Office files are common and can contain valuable data.

Now, moving on to the Exfiltration phase. The question is about whether the malware would encode these archives with an unusual scheme and split them. I remember that some malware uses encoding to avoid detection. For example, Base64 encoding is common, but maybe PROMETHIUM uses something less common to evade detection. Splitting into chunks could help in avoiding large data transfers that might raise alarms, especially if the network monitoring is looking for big file transfers.

I should think about the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Under T1560, which is Data Encoding, techniques include using standard or non-standard encoding to make data harder to detect. T1090 covers data transfer size variations to avoid detection. So, if PROMETHIUM is using both, it would align with these tactics.

Looking at the answer choices, A is Yes and B is No. Since the question is about whether it's likely, and considering the common practices of malware to encode and split data for stealth, I think the answer is Yes. PROMETHIUM would probably do both to make exfiltration less detectable.

PROMETHIUM, during the Exfiltration phase, is likely to encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks to avoid detection. This aligns with common malware tactics to evade network monitoring, using techniques such as data encoding and varying transfer sizes. 

Final Answer: A
