Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Lokibot is likely to escalate privileges by injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe before using process hollowing to bypass UAC. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence described. The question mentions a malicious macro that downloads and executes a second-stage downloader. This downloader then fetches an encrypted third-stage payload. So, the attack is progressing through multiple stages, which is pretty common in malware attacks.

Now, the question is about the next steps: privilege escalation using DLL injection into Notepad.exe and then process hollowing to bypass UAC. I remember that Lokibot is a known banking Trojan, so I should think about its typical behavior.

I know that privilege escalation is a common tactic in malware to gain higher-level access. One method is DLL injection, where a malicious DLL is injected into a legitimate process. Notepad.exe is a common target because it's a trusted process, and injecting into it can help hide malicious activity. So, that makes sense as a step.

Process hollowing is another technique where a legitimate process is started in a suspended state, its memory is replaced with malicious code, and then resumed. This can bypass User Account Control (UAC) because the process appears legitimate. So, using process hollowing after DLL injection could be a way to escalate privileges without triggering UAC prompts.

But wait, I'm not sure if Lokibot specifically uses this combination. I should recall or look up if Lokibot is known for these techniques. From what I remember, Lokibot does use various injection techniques, including DLL injection, and it's also known to use process hollowing. However, the order might matter here.

In some cases, malware might inject a DLL into a process to load additional payloads or to execute malicious code. Then, to escalate privileges, they might use process hollowing to execute code in a higher privilege process. So, the sequence of injecting into Notepad.exe first and then using hollowing to bypass UAC seems plausible.

But I'm also thinking about the overall attack flow. After the third-stage payload is decrypted, the malware might need to escalate privileges to perform more damaging actions, like stealing credentials or moving laterally. So, using these techniques in this order would fit into that phase.

However, I'm not entirely certain if Lokibot specifically uses Notepad.exe for DLL injection. It might use other processes more commonly, but Notepad is a possible target. Also, process hollowing is a more advanced technique, so it's something a sophisticated malware like Lokibot might employ.

Putting it all together, while I'm not 100% sure, the sequence described seems plausible for Lokibot's behavior. Therefore, the answer is likely yes.
</think>

The attack sequence involves a malicious macro leading to a third-stage payload, after which privilege escalation is considered. Lokibot, a banking Trojan, is known to use techniques like DLL injection and process hollowing. Injecting a DLL into Notepad.exe can hide malicious activity, and process hollowing can bypass UAC. While Lokibot may use other processes, the described sequence is plausible.
