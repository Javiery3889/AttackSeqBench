Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Konni APT Group would send collected data through 'unactivate.vbs' before exfiltrating it via a POST request. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The question mentions that after using 'versioninfo.bat' to collect information, the next step is whether they use 'unactivate.vbs' to send this data before exfiltration. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of these tools, so I'll start by researching them.

I know that 'versioninfo.bat' is a script used to gather system information. It's a common tool in APT groups to collect data about the target's environment. Now, 'unactivate.vbs' sounds like a VBScript. VBScripts are often used in malware for various tasks, including data exfiltration or system manipulation.

I recall that the Konni APT group, also known as APT27 or BlackOasis, uses a variety of tools and techniques. They are known for using legitimate tools and scripts to carry out their attacks. Their modus operandi includes using batch scripts and VBScripts for data collection and exfiltration.

In their attack lifecycle, after collecting data, they need a way to send it out. Using a VBScript like 'unactivate.vbs' could be a method to encode or package the data before sending it. Alternatively, they might use other scripts or tools for this purpose.

Now, considering the exfiltration method: a POST request. This is a common HTTP method used to send data to a server. If 'unactivate.vbs' is involved, it might be used to prepare the data, perhaps by encoding it or formatting it in a way that can be sent via POST. Alternatively, the script might handle the actual sending of the data.

I should check if 'unactivate.vbs' is known to be used by Konni for exfiltration. From what I remember, Konni uses a tool called 'unactivate' which is a VBScript. This script is used to gather system information and then send it to a remote server. It's often used after initial data collection to exfiltrate the data.

So, putting it together: 'versioninfo.bat' collects data, then 'unactivate.vbs' processes and sends it via a POST request. This seems plausible because it aligns with their known tactics of using scripts for both data collection and exfiltration.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, they are likely to use 'unactivate.vbs' before exfiltrating via POST.

The Konni APT Group is known to use 'versioninfo.bat' for data collection and 'unactivate.vbs' for exfiltration. The script 'unactivate.vbs' is used to gather and send data via POST requests, aligning with their tactics.
