Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers would have obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing JavaScript file and using Dean Edwards Packer. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the scenario is that attackers modified a JavaScript file on the Afghan Government's CDN server. The file in question is jquery-1.4.2.min.js, which is a common library, so it's probably used by multiple websites. By modifying this file, the attackers can deliver malicious code to any site that includes this script.

Now, the question is about whether they would obfuscate the code using Dean Edwards Packer. Obfuscation is a common technique used by attackers to make their code harder to detect and analyze. Dean Edwards Packer is a tool that can compress and obfuscate JavaScript code, making it more compact and less readable.

So, the attackers appended their malicious code to the existing file. Appending makes sense because it allows them to hide their code within legitimate content, which might bypass some security checks. Then, using a tool like Dean Edwards Packer would further obfuscate the code, making it harder for security systems to detect the malicious payload.

I'm thinking about the MITRE ATT&CK framework here. Obfuscation falls under Defense Evasion tactics, specifically T1027.004, which is about obfuscating scripts. Attackers often use such methods to avoid detection by antivirus software or intrusion detection systems.

So, putting it all together, it makes sense that the attackers would use Dean Edwards Packer to obfuscate their code. This would help them evade detection and ensure their malicious code is executed without being easily spotted. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The attackers likely used Dean Edwards Packer to obfuscate their malicious code, as this method aligns with common tactics to evade detection. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
