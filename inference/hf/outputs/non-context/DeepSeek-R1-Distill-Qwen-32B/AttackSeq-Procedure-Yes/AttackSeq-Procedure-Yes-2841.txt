Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and download the full RAT component before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the initial access was achieved through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158. I remember that CVE-2012-0158 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, specifically in how it handles certain objects, which can lead to remote code execution. So, when the victim opens the RTF document, the exploit is triggered.

The exploit drops an embedded downloader file. So, the first thing that happens is the execution of this downloader. The downloader's purpose is typically to fetch additional malicious components from a remote server. In this case, the malware in question is MSIL/Crimson, which is a known Remote Access Trojan (RAT). 

Now, the question is about the sequence of actions. After the downloader is executed, it's logical that it would attempt to download the full RAT component. The server mentioned is 213.136.87[.]122:10001. So, the downloader would connect to this server on port 10001 to retrieve the RAT.

Once the RAT component is downloaded, the next step would be establishing command and control (C2) communication. The question specifies that this is done using a custom TCP protocol. So, after the RAT is on the machine, it would initiate communication with the attacker's server using this custom protocol to receive commands and send data back.

Putting it all together: the sequence is initial access via exploit, execution of the downloader, download of the RAT, and then establishing C2. So, the answer should be yes, this sequence is likely.

I don't see any reason why the downloader wouldn't download the RAT first before establishing C2. Usually, the downloader's job is to get the main payload, which then handles the C2 communication. So, the steps make sense in the order described.

The sequence of events described follows a typical malware attack pattern. The exploit in the RTF document triggers the execution of a downloader, which then retrieves the RAT component. Once the RAT is on the system, it establishes command and control using a custom TCP protocol. This sequence is consistent with how such malware operates.

Final Answer: A: Yes
