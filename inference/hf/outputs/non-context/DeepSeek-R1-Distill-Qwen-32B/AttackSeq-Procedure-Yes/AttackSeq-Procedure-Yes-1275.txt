Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the data collected by Yellow Garuda using a Telegram 'grabber' tool is likely exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite and JSON formats. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what Yellow Garuda is. From what I remember, Yellow Garuda is a cyber threat group, possibly involved in espionage or data theft. They use various tools to collect information from their victims. The question mentions they're using a Telegram 'grabber' tool, which I assume is a type of malware or tool designed to extract data from Telegram accounts.

So, the grabber tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. That makes sense because Telegram is a messaging app, and such tools are often used to harvest this kind of information for intelligence or malicious purposes.

Now, the next part is about exfiltration. Exfiltration refers to the process of transferring data from a compromised system to an external location. The question is asking if this data is likely exfiltrated over the web. Well, in most cyberattacks, especially those involving espionage, the attackers need a way to get the data out. Using the web is a common method because it's accessible and can be done covertly. So, it's plausible that the data is sent over the internet to a server controlled by the attackers.

Then, the question mentions storing the data in SQLite database and JSON format. SQLite is a lightweight database that's easy to use and doesn't require a separate server, making it suitable for storing structured data. JSON is a data interchange format that's easy to read and write, often used for data serialization. Both formats are commonly used in malware and data exfiltration because they allow for efficient storage and easy parsing of the collected information.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the reasoning above, it seems likely that the data would be exfiltrated over the web and stored in these formats. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The analysis indicates that Yellow Garuda likely exfiltrates the collected data over the web and stores it in SQLite and JSON formats, as these are common practices in cyber espionage for efficient data handling.

Final Answer: A
