Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Konni APT Group would execute deobfuscated batch and VBScript files like 'stopedge.bat' and 'install.vbs' after gaining initial access via an ISO file. The question is asking if this sequence is likely, and the options are Yes or No.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question is referring to. The initial access is through an ISO file with malicious scripts. I know that ISO files can be used to distribute malware because they can contain executable files or scripts. Once the ISO is downloaded and mounted, the user might run a script, which could be the first step in an attack.

Next, the question mentions deobfuscating batch and VBScript files. Deobfuscation is a technique used to make malicious code readable, which attackers often do to hide their activities. So, after the initial access, the attacker might run a script that deobfuscates other scripts to execute further steps.

The specific files mentioned are 'stopedge.bat' and 'install.vbs'. 'stopedge.bat' sounds like it might be stopping some edge-related service, perhaps to prevent detection or interference. Then 'install.vbs' is scheduled to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists. Scheduling a script to run periodically is a common persistence mechanism. The presence of 'paycom.ini' might be a check to ensure certain conditions are met before executing.

I should check if Konni APT Group is known for using such techniques. From what I remember, Konni, also known as APT29 or Cozy Bear, is a Russian cyber espionage group. They are known for using various TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). They often use spear-phishing, document exploitation, and persistence mechanisms.

Looking into their TTPs, they do use malicious scripts and batch files. For example, they might use batch scripts to execute commands, delete files, or modify system configurations. VBScripts are also common because they can be used to perform a variety of tasks without needing to install additional software.

Persistence is a key part of their operations. They need to maintain access to compromised systems over time. Scheduling a script to run at regular intervals is a way to ensure persistence. The use of an INI file as a check could be part of their method to ensure the script runs only under specific conditions, perhaps to avoid detection or to wait until certain resources are available.

Putting it all together, the sequence described aligns with known Konni APT Group tactics. They would likely use deobfuscated scripts to execute further malicious activities, including scheduling persistence mechanisms. The use of batch and VBScript files, along with persistence through scheduled tasks, fits their modus operandi.

So, considering all this, the answer should be Yes.

The sequence described aligns with the known tactics of the Konni APT Group, which includes using deobfuscated scripts and persistence mechanisms. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
