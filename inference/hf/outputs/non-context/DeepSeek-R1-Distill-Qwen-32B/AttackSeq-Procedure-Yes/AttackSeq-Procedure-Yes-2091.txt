Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether attackers, after using Cobalt Strike beacon to map an organization's internal network and collect administrative credentials, are likely to move laterally. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Cobalt Strike is a tool often used by attackers for initial access, command and control, and lateral movement. The beacon is a type of payload that communicates back to the attacker's server, allowing them to control the compromised system.

The question mentions that the attackers have already mapped the internal network. That means they have a good understanding of the structure, which is crucial for lateral movement. Mapping the network helps them identify key targets like servers, workstations, and other critical systems.

Next, they've collected administrative-level credentials. Administrative access is powerful because it grants them privileges that can be used to move laterally. With these credentials, attackers can log into other systems, access sensitive data, and potentially take control of more machines.

Now, considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, lateral movement is a common tactic after initial access and credential harvesting. Attackers typically use tools like Cobalt Strike to pivot across the network. They might use techniques like Pass-the-Hash or other credential-based lateral movements to access other systems without needing to exploit each one individually.

So, putting it all together: the attackers have the tools (Cobalt Strike), the knowledge of the network layout, and the necessary credentials. It makes sense that their next step would be to move laterally to compromise more systems, especially targeting workstations and servers which are often high-value targets.

Therefore, the answer should be that yes, it's likely they will move laterally.

The attackers have mapped the network and obtained administrative credentials, which are key enablers for lateral movement. Using tools like Cobalt Strike, they can exploit these credentials to move across the network, targeting workstations and servers. This aligns with common attack tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Final Answer: A: Yes
