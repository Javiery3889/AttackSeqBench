Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel using automated exfiltration after communicating with the C2 server using RESTful Strapi and JSON. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that BlackSoul is a type of malware, specifically a ransomware. Ransomware typically has a few main phases: initial infection, command and control communication, data exfiltration, encryption, and then ransom demands.

The question mentions that BlackSoul communicates with the C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding. RESTful APIs are common for C2 because they're easy to use and can be integrated into various systems. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format, so it makes sense for sending commands and data back and forth.

Now, the next part is about exfiltration. Exfiltration is when the malware sends data from the victim's network to the attacker's server. Ransomware often exfiltrates data to either steal it for additional extortion (like in the case of double extortion ransomware) or to ensure they have the data to decrypt if the victim doesn't pay. 

BlackSoul, as a ransomware, would likely need to exfiltrate data to the C2 server. This is because the attackers need to have the data to decrypt it after encryption, which is a common tactic. Automated exfiltration would mean that this process is done without manual intervention, which is typical for ransomware to speed up the attack process.

So, putting it together: after establishing communication with the C2 server using RESTful and JSON, the next logical step would be exfiltration. Since the question is asking if it's likely, the answer would be yes.

BlackSoul, as a ransomware, typically communicates with its C2 server using RESTful Strapi and JSON. After establishing this communication, it's common for ransomware to exfiltrate data automatically to facilitate decryption demands. Therefore, it is likely that BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
