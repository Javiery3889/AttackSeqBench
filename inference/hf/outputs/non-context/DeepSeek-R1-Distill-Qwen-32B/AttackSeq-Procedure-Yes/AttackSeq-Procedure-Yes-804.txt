Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the scenario described is likely based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The question is about a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists, which is used to gain initial access. Then, the group GOLDBACKDOOR is said to execute a Windows shortcut file that looks like a document to run an obfuscated PowerShell script for deploying malware.

First, I need to break down the components of the attack sequence. Spear-phishing is a common initial access vector, so that makes sense. The next step is using a Windows shortcut file, which is a common tactic because people are used to seeing .lnk files or other shortcut icons, so they might not be suspicious. These shortcut files can be designed to execute malicious code when clicked.

Then, the shortcut is supposed to run an obfuscated PowerShell script. Obfuscating scripts is a known technique to avoid detection by antivirus software. PowerShell is a powerful tool in Windows environments and is often used by attackers because it's built-in and can execute a wide range of commands and scripts.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, I recall that spear-phishing for initial access is T1566.002. Using malicious documents, which includes shortcut files, falls under T1558.001. Executing scripts with obfuscation is part of T1027.004. So, each step here aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.

GOLDBACKDOOR, if I remember correctly, is an APT group known for using such methods. They often use spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, which could include shortcut files. The use of PowerShell for deployment is also consistent with their behavior.

So, putting it all together, the sequence makes sense. The initial access via spear-phishing, using a shortcut to execute a script, and obfuscation to avoid detection are all steps that fit into a typical attack pattern. Therefore, it's likely that GOLDBACKDOOR would use this sequence of TTPs.

The scenario described aligns with known attack tactics. Spear-phishing is a common initial access method (T1566.002). Using a shortcut file (T1558.001) to execute an obfuscated PowerShell script (T1027.004) is consistent with attacker behavior, including that of GOLDBACKDOOR. Therefore, the sequence is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
