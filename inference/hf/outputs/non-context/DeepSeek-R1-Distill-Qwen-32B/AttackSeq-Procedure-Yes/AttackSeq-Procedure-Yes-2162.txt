Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst would automatically investigate an infected device after detecting Command and Control (C2) activity following a spear phishing attack by APT35. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT35 is a known threat group that uses spear phishing as an initial access vector. So, the question is about what happens after they've successfully infiltrated a corporate device through that method. The question is specifically about whether Darktrace's tool would automate the investigation process once C2 is detected.

Darktrace is a cybersecurity company that uses AI for detecting and responding to threats. Their Cyber AI Analyst is designed to automate parts of the incident response process. I remember that Darktrace's technology is based on unsupervised machine learning, which means it can detect anomalies without relying on signatures. So, it's good at spotting unusual network behaviors, which could indicate C2 traffic.

Now, the question is whether the Cyber AI Analyst would automatically investigate the infected device after detecting C2. From what I understand, Darktrace's system can indeed trigger automated responses. For example, it can isolate devices, block malicious IPs, or even shut down compromised accounts. But does it automatically investigate the device in the sense of analyzing it for further indicators of compromise?

I think the Cyber AI Analyst is more about detection and response rather than deep forensic analysis. It can collect evidence, like logs and network traffic, but for a full investigation, especially in a corporate setting, human analysts are usually involved. Automated tools can flag the issue, gather initial data, and maybe contain the threat, but the detailed investigation might require manual steps.

So, putting it together: After the initial detection of C2, Darktrace would likely trigger some automated responses, but the full investigation process, especially the analysis part, would probably still need human intervention. Therefore, the answer would be that it's not likely that the Cyber AI Analyst fully automates the investigation process on its own.

Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is designed to detect anomalies and trigger automated responses, such as isolating devices or blocking malicious IPs, upon detecting Command and Control (C2) activity. However, while it can collect initial evidence and contain the threat, the detailed investigation typically requires human analysts. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Cyber AI Analyst fully automates the investigation process.

Final Answer: B: No
