Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the "Machete" malware, after establishing persistence, is likely to log keystrokes, capture audio, and hijack the clipboard. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that persistence in malware often involves creating files or registry entries so the malware runs at startup. The question mentions that Machete creates a shortcut 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs itself in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. That makes sense for persistence because it ensures the malware runs each time the system starts.

Now, the next part is about the subsequent actions: logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and hijacking the clipboard. These are all information-stealing techniques. Keystroke logging captures what the user types, which could include passwords or sensitive info. Audio capture is more advanced; it can record conversations or sounds around the computer, which might be used for espionage. Clipboard hijacking allows the malware to steal data copied to the clipboard, like credentials or other sensitive information.

I need to think about whether these actions are typical for malware. Many malware strains do use keystroke logging and clipboard hijacking. Audio capture is a bit less common but still possible, especially in more sophisticated attacks. So, it's plausible that Machete would use these methods to gather as much information as possible.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the typical behavior of malware aiming to steal information, these TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) fit well. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The "Machete" malware establishes persistence through creating a shortcut and installing itself in specific directories. Subsequently, it is likely to employ information-stealing techniques such as keystroke logging, audio capture, and clipboard hijacking, which are common in malware behavior. 

Final Answer: A
