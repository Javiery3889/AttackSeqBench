Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the BlueDelta campaign exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and then used Roundcube webmail vulnerabilities for discovery. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what BlueDelta is. From what I remember, BlueDelta is a cyber espionage campaign associated with the Russian state, specifically linked to the GRU's Unit 26165. They're known for targeting government and military organizations, especially in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

Now, the question mentions Roundcube mail servers and a specific CVE: CVE-2020-35730. I should check what that CVE is about. Looking it up, CVE-2020-35730 is a vulnerability in Roundcube Webmail. It's a remote code execution flaw that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. That sounds like a critical vulnerability because it can lead to full system compromise if exploited.

So, the scenario is that BlueDelta used this CVE for initial access. That makes sense because if they can exploit a vulnerability in the mail server, they can gain initial access to the network. Once inside, they might use other techniques to move laterally or gather information.

The next part is about exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail for discovery activities. Wait, but if they already exploited Roundcube for initial access, wouldn't they have already gained access? Maybe they used the same vulnerability again for further actions, but that seems a bit redundant. Alternatively, perhaps they used another vulnerability in Roundcube for discovery, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

I should think about the typical attack sequence. Usually, initial access is the first step, then they might perform reconnaissance or discovery to understand the environment. So, after gaining initial access via CVE-2020-35730, they would likely use other techniques for discovery, such as credential dumping, network scanning, or using tools like Mimikatz. But the question specifically mentions exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube again for discovery. That seems a bit odd because once they're in, they might not need to exploit the same vulnerability again.

Wait, maybe the question is saying that after initial access, they exploited another vulnerability in Roundcube for discovery. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the initial access was via the CVE, and then they used other methods for discovery, not necessarily another exploit.

I should also consider if BlueDelta has been known to use Roundcube vulnerabilities. From what I know, BlueDelta has used various methods, including spear phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and using malware. They have targeted email systems, so it's plausible they exploited Roundcube.

But the question is about the sequence: initial access via CVE-2020-35730, then using Roundcube vulnerabilities for discovery. That might not be the typical sequence because once you have initial access, you might not need another exploit for discovery. Unless the discovery phase involved exploiting another vulnerability in Roundcube, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the question is conflating the initial access and discovery phases. Perhaps the initial access was via the CVE, and then they used the same access to gather information, which is part of the discovery phase. So, in that case, the sequence would make sense.

I think the key here is whether the same vulnerability was used for both initial access and discovery, or if they used another method for discovery. Since the question specifies exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube for both, it's a bit unclear. But given that CVE-2020-35730 is a remote code execution vulnerability, it's likely that exploiting it would give them initial access, and then they could use that access to perform discovery without needing another exploit.

So, putting it all together, it's plausible that BlueDelta used CVE-2020-35730 for initial access and then used their access to perform discovery activities, possibly without needing another exploit. Therefore, the answer would be yes, it's likely.
</think>

The BlueDelta campaign, associated with the Russian GRU, is known for targeting government and military organizations, often exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access. CVE-2020-35730, a critical remote code execution flaw in Roundcube Webmail, would provide initial access. Once inside, attackers typically perform discovery activities, which could include using their access to gather information without necessarily exploiting another vulnerability. Thus, the sequence described is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
