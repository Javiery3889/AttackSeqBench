Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether after some reconnaissance activities, like gathering publicly available info and doing active discovery, a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3 would establish communication with a Command-and-Control (C2) server once it's installed via an employee-enabled macro. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question is about. Reconnaissance is the first step in many cyber attacks. It involves gathering information about the target, which can be passive (like looking at public info) or active (like scanning or probing the network). BlackEnergy 3 is a known malware, often used in targeted attacks, especially against industrial control systems. It's known for its use in attacks like the 2015 and 2016 Ukraine power grid attacks.

Malicious implants, like BlackEnergy, typically have a few stages. After being installed, they usually try to connect back to a C2 server to receive commands or download additional payloads. Macros in documents are a common way to deliver such malware because they can execute code when the document is opened, especially if the user enables macros.

So, the sequence here is: reconnaissance, then using a macro to install the implant, and then the implant communicates with C2. That makes sense because the malware needs to check in with its command server to get further instructions or exfiltrate data.

I should also think about the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The steps mentioned align with several tactics. Reconnaissance is part of the Initial Access phase, using macros is a common Initial Access vector (T1566.002), and establishing C2 is part of the Command and Control tactic (T1071). So, the sequence is logical and follows typical attack patterns.

Therefore, it's highly likely that after the initial infection via macro, the implant would establish communication with its C2 server. So the answer should be A: Yes.

The question involves determining whether a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3 would establish communication with a Command-and-Control (C2) server after being installed via an employee-enabled macro, following reconnaissance activities. 

1. **Reconnaissance**: This is a standard first step in cyber attacks, involving gathering information about the target, which can be passive or active.
2. **Malware Delivery**: BlackEnergy 3 is known to be delivered via macros in documents, which execute code when macros are enabled.
3. **C2 Communication**: Once installed, such malware typically communicates with a C2 server to receive commands or exfiltrate data.

This sequence aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where reconnaissance is part of Initial Access, macro usage is a common vector (T1566.002), and C2 communication is a tactic (T1071). Therefore, it is highly likely that the implant would establish C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A**
