Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attack sequence described is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attack starts with a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department, SAT, delivering a file called COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip. This is the Initial Access phase, which makes sense because phishing is a common method for initial access.

Next, the question asks if the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet. I know that after initial access, attackers often use scripts to carry out further actions. PowerShell is a popular choice because it's built into Windows and can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. So, executing a PowerShell script from the Internet seems plausible because attackers might use it to download additional tools or execute commands without writing to the disk, which can help avoid detection.

Then, the question mentions running the script at the memory level. This refers to in-memory execution, which is a technique attackers use to avoid leaving traces on the disk. By running scripts directly in memory, they can perform actions without creating files that might be detected by antivirus or other security measures. This is a common tactic in sophisticated attacks.

After that, the attack ensures persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks. Persistence is a key step in maintaining access to the compromised system. Using startup folders and scheduled tasks are standard methods because they allow the attacker's tools to run automatically when the system starts or at specific times. This ensures that even after a reboot, the attacker can regain access without having to re-exploit the system.

Putting it all together: Initial access via phishing, execution of a PowerShell script from the Internet, in-memory execution to avoid detection, and then setting up persistence through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks. This sequence aligns well with typical attack patterns, especially those involving malware like TrickBot or Qakbot, which often use these techniques.

I don't see any red flags in this sequence. Each step logically follows the previous one, using methods that are both effective and commonly observed in cyberattacks. Therefore, it's likely that the attack proceeds in this manner.

The attack sequence described follows a logical and common pattern in cyberattacks. The initial access via phishing is followed by the execution of a PowerShell script, which is often used for its stealth and versatility. The script runs in memory to avoid detection, and persistence is established through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks, ensuring continued access. This sequence is consistent with known attack tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
