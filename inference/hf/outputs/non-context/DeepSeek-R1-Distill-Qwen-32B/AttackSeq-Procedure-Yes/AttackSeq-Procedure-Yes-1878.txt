Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13 is likely to gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand who FIN13 is. From what I remember, FIN13 is a cyber threat group, often associated with cyber espionage activities. They're known for targeting various sectors, including government, defense, and critical infrastructure. Their tactics usually involve sophisticated methods to gain unauthorized access and steal sensitive information.

Now, the question is about their TTPs, which stands for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Specifically, it's asking if they would use native OS binaries for reconnaissance before moving on to dumping LSASS memory for credentials.

Let me think about the typical attack lifecycle. Usually, an attack starts with reconnaissance, where the attacker gathers information about the target. This can involve using tools to map the network, gather system information, etc. Using native OS binaries makes sense because they're already present on the system, making them less likely to be detected by antivirus or other security measures. Tools like 'netstat', 'tasklist', 'systeminfo', or even PowerShell can be used for this purpose.

After reconnaissance, the next step might be credential harvesting. LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is a process that holds credentials in memory, so dumping its memory can give attackers access to usernames and passwords, which they can then use to move laterally within the network or escalate privileges.

I recall that FIN13 has been known to use living off the land techniques, which means they use legitimate tools and processes that are already present on the target systems. This reduces their need to bring in custom malware, which could be more easily detected. So, using native binaries for reconnaissance fits with their known methods.

Additionally, credential dumping is a common next step after gaining initial access. By obtaining credentials, attackers can move more freely within the network, access restricted areas, and maintain persistence. Dumping LSASS is a well-documented technique used by many APT groups, including those like FIN13.

Putting it all together, the sequence makes sense: gather information using native tools, then use that information to dump LSASS for credentials. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework as well, where techniques like OS Credential Dumping (T1003) and Account Access Removal (T1531) are part of the process.

I don't see any reason why FIN13 wouldn't follow this sequence. It's efficient, stealthy, and leverages existing tools, which are all hallmarks of their operations. So, the answer should be yes.

The analysis indicates that FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries for reconnaissance before credential dumping. This approach aligns with their known tactics of using living off the land techniques and the typical attack lifecycle, making the sequence plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
