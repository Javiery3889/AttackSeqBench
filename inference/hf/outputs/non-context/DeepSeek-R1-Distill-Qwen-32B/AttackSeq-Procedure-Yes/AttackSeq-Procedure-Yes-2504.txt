Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SHOTPUT backdoor, delivered by APT3 via phishing emails exploiting a zero-day vulnerability from the Hacking Team leak, will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses. Also, I need to consider if GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18's phishing campaign, calls out to an APT18 CnC address. The options are Yes or No.

First, I need to understand the question properly. It's about two different APT groups using different backdoors and whether their CnC communication is as described.

I know that APT3 is known for using various tools, including SHOTPUT. SHOTPUT is a backdoor that I think typically uses hardcoded Command and Control (CnC) addresses. That means the CnC servers are pre-programmed into the malware, so when it's activated, it reaches out to those specific addresses.

On the other hand, GH0ST RAT is another backdoor, often associated with APT18. I remember that GH0ST RAT usually doesn't have hardcoded CnC addresses. Instead, it might use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) or other methods to dynamically generate or fetch CnC domains. This makes it harder for defenders to block because the domains change frequently.

So, putting it together: SHOTPUT (APT3) likely uses hardcoded CnC, while GH0ST RAT (APT18) probably doesn't. The question is asking if both scenarios are likely. Since SHOTPUT does use hardcoded addresses and GH0ST RAT doesn't, the answer would be that the first part is true, but the second part is false. Therefore, the overall statement is not entirely accurate because GH0ST RAT doesn't call out to hardcoded APT18 CnC addresses.

Wait, but the question is phrased as whether both are likely. So if one is true and the other is false, the answer would be No, because the second part isn't correct. So the answer is B: No.

The SHOTPUT backdoor, used by APT3, typically communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses. However, GH0ST RAT, associated with APT18, does not use hardcoded CnC addresses but instead employs methods like DGAs. Therefore, the statement that both use hardcoded CnC addresses is incorrect.

Final Answer: B: No
