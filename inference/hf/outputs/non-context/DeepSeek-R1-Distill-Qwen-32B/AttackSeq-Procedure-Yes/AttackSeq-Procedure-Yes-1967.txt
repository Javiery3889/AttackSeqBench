Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the StellarParticle campaign used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP during their lateral movement after using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that AdFind is a tool used for querying Active Directory information. It's often used by attackers to gather details about users, groups, and other AD objects. Custom PowerShell cmdlets would allow them to automate and customize their data gathering, which is pretty common in cyberattacks.

The question is about whether they used both types of accounts for RDP. RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, which is a way to access another computer remotely. Using RDP, attackers can move laterally through a network, accessing different machines to spread their attack.

In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, lateral movement is a key tactic. Attackers often use legitimate credentials to move through a network because it's stealthier and harder to detect. They might use both privileged and non-privileged accounts for different purposes. Privileged accounts, like domain admin accounts, give them high-level access, while non-privileged accounts might be used to access specific resources or move through less sensitive parts of the network.

StellarParticle is a campaign I'm not too familiar with, but based on the tools mentioned, it seems like they're conducting discovery activities. After gathering AD info, the next step would likely be lateral movement. Using RDP with both types of accounts makes sense because it allows them to access different systems with varying levels of access, which can help them reach their target data repositories more effectively.

So, putting it all together, it's plausible that they used both account types for RDP to move laterally. This approach would help them maintain persistence and access the necessary data without being detected easily.

The StellarParticle campaign utilized tools like AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to gather Active Directory information, which is a common first step in cyberattacks. After this discovery phase, lateral movement is a typical next step, often involving RDP. Using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP allows attackers to access different systems with varying levels of access, aiding in stealth and effectiveness. Therefore, it is likely that they used both account types.

Final Answer: A: Yes
