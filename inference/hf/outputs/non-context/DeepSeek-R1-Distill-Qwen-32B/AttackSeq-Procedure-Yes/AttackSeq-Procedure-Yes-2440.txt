Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Elise malware, after performing certain actions, is likely to use defense evasion techniques like anti-virtual machine features and obfuscation while exfiltrating data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware injects NavShExt.dll into Internet Explorer. I know that DLL injection is a common technique used by malware to execute code within another process, which can help it evade detection because it's running under a legitimate process. So that's already a sign of possible evasion tactics.

Next, it creates a mutex named 'donotbotherme'. Mutexes are used to synchronize processes and prevent multiple instances from running. In the context of malware, this is often used to ensure that only one instance of the malware runs, which can prevent analysis in sandboxes or VMs where multiple instances might be spun up quickly. So this is another evasion technique.

Now, the question is whether Elise will employ heavy anti-virtual-machine (AVM) features and obfuscation during data exfiltration. AVM techniques are used to detect if the malware is running in a virtual environment, which is a common setup for analysis. If Elise uses these, it can delay or prevent analysis, giving it more time to carry out its objectives.

Obfuscation is another key evasion method. By obfuscating its code or the data it's sending, the malware can hide its activities from network monitoring tools and sandboxes. This makes it harder for defenders to analyze the data being exfiltrated or understand the malware's behavior.

Putting it all together, the initial steps of DLL injection and mutex creation are already indicative of evasion tactics. It's logical that the malware would continue using such methods during data exfiltration to avoid detection. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The Elise malware's initial actions, such as DLL injection and mutex creation, suggest the use of evasion techniques. Continuing with anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation during data exfiltration aligns with these tactics, making it likely.

Final Answer: A
