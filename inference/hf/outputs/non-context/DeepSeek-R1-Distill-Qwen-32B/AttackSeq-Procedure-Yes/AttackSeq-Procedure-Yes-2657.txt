Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Korplug variant communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol after collecting data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Korplug is a type of malware, specifically a variant of the PlugX remote access tool (RAT). PlugX is known for its modular structure, which allows it to perform various malicious activities. From what I remember, PlugX variants often have the capability to collect data from infected systems and then exfiltrate that data to command and control (C&C) servers.

The question mentions that after collecting data from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives, Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers. The communication method described is a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, followed by encrypted communication over TCP.

I need to determine if this sequence of actions is plausible. Let me think about how malware typically operates. After data collection, the next logical step is exfiltration. Malware often uses custom protocols to communicate with C&C servers to avoid detection. Using HTTPS for the initial handshake could help in evading network monitoring since HTTPS is encrypted and commonly used, making it less suspicious. Once the initial connection is established, switching to a custom TCP protocol with encryption would allow the malware to maintain a secure and stealthy communication channel.

I should also consider if Korplug specifically uses such methods. Since PlugX is modular, it's designed to be flexible. It's known to use various communication methods, including encrypted channels. The use of a custom protocol would make it harder for defenders to detect and block the traffic, which aligns with the tactics of advanced malware.

So, putting it all together, the sequence makes sense. Data collection is followed by communication using a custom protocol, starting with HTTPS to blend in, then switching to encrypted TCP for ongoing operations. This would be a typical approach for such malware to ensure both stealth and security in their communications.

The Korplug variant, as a PlugX RAT, is designed to collect data and then exfiltrate it. It uses a custom TCP-based protocol, starting with an HTTPS handshake to avoid detection, followed by encrypted TCP communication. This sequence is consistent with typical malware behavior, making the scenario plausible.
