Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate files using Tor and then SSH. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what Infamous Chisel is. From what I remember, Infamous Chisel is a type of malware, specifically a remote access tool (RAT) that's been used in various cyberattacks. It's known for its ability to collect information and exfiltrate data from compromised systems.

The question mentions that after collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data, Infamous Chisel is likely to exfiltrate these files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections. I need to determine if this sequence of actions makes sense based on how Infamous Chisel typically operates.

I should recall the MITRE ATT&CK framework to see which tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) align with this scenario. Exfiltration is a common TTP, and using Tor for communication is a known method to hide the attacker's identity. SSH is often used for secure data transfer, but it's also a common tool for command and control (C2) in some malware.

Looking at the answer choices, it's a yes or no question. So, I need to assess whether using Tor followed by SSH is a typical method for Infamous Chisel.

I think Infamous Chisel is known for using Tor for command and control. It uses Tor hidden services to communicate with its C2 servers, which helps in anonymizing the attacker's location. Once the data is collected, it might use various methods to exfiltrate, but I'm not sure if SSH is a standard method for it. SSH is more commonly used for legitimate remote access but can be abused. However, I don't recall Infamous Chisel specifically using SSH for exfiltration. It might use other methods like HTTP, FTP, or even custom protocols.

So, the sequence described in the question involves Tor followed by SSH. While Tor is a known method, SSH might not be the typical next step for Infamous Chisel. Therefore, the answer might be no because the specific combination of Tor and then SSH isn't a standard procedure for this malware.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up different malware. Some other malware does use Tor and SSH together, but I'm not sure about Infamous Chisel. I should double-check if there's any specific information about Infamous Chisel using SSH for exfiltration. If there isn't, then the answer would be no.

Alternatively, if the question is about the plausibility in general, regardless of Infamous Chisel's specific methods, then using Tor for anonymity and SSH for secure exfiltration could make sense. But since the question is about Infamous Chisel specifically, I think the answer is no because it doesn't typically use SSH in that way.

So, putting it all together, the answer is likely B: No.

Infamous Chisel is a malware known for using Tor hidden services for command and control, but it does not typically use SSH for exfiltration. The described sequence of Tor followed by SSH is not a standard method for this malware.

Final Answer: B
