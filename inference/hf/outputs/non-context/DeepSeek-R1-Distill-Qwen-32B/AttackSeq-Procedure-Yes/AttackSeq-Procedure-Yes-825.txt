Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Armageddon Group, after using spearphishing emails to gain initial access, would likely use mshta.exe to launch a VBScript and then modify the registry RUN key with a malicious PE file. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that spearphishing is a common initial access vector. Attackers send emails with malicious attachments or links to trick victims into giving them access. So, that part makes sense.

Next, using mshta.exe. I remember that mshta.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used to run HTML applications. It's often abused by attackers because it's a trusted executable, so it might not be flagged by antivirus. So, if the spearphishing email gets someone to open a malicious attachment, the payload might use mshta.exe to execute a VBScript. VBScripts are another common tool for attackers because they can perform various tasks on a system, like downloading additional malware or executing commands.

Then, maintaining persistence by modifying the registry RUN key. The RUN key in the Windows registry is a common place for attackers to add entries so that their malicious software runs at startup. If they use a malicious PE file (which is a Portable Executable, like an exe or dll), they might place it somewhere and then add a reference to it in the RUN key. This ensures that the malicious activity continues even after a system restart.

Putting it all together, the sequence seems plausible. Spearphishing for initial access, using mshta.exe to execute a VBScript for the next stage, and then modifying the registry for persistence. I don't see any red flags here. It's a common attack chain used by various groups, including nation-state actors like those associated with Russia, which I think Armageddon Group might be linked to.

So, I think the answer is yes, this sequence is likely.

The sequence described is a common attack pattern where attackers use spearphishing for initial access, leverage mshta.exe to execute a VBScript, and then modify the registry for persistence. This aligns with typical tactics used by groups like Armageddon, making the scenario plausible.
