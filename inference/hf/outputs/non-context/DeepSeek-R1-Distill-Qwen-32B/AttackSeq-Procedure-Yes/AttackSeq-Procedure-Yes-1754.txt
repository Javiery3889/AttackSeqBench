Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Shuckworm would use mshta.exe after deploying their backdoor. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Shuckworm is a cyber threat group, and they use certain tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The question mentions they execute malicious VBS scripts and deploy a custom backdoor. Now, the next step is whether they would use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before using HTTP-based C&C servers.

I remember that mshta.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used to run HTML applications. It's often abused by attackers because it's a trusted executable, which can help bypass application control measures that might block other malicious binaries. So, using mshta.exe makes sense as a way to execute code without being detected.

In the context of the attack sequence, after establishing a backdoor, attackers often need to download additional tools or communicate with their command and control (C&C) servers. If application control solutions are in place, using a legitimate tool like mshta.exe could be a way to execute malicious code or download other payloads without triggering alerts.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the reasoning that mshta.exe is a common technique to bypass application controls, it seems plausible that Shuckworm would use it in this scenario. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

Shuckworm is known to use malicious VBS scripts and custom backdoors. To bypass application control solutions, using mshta.exe, a legitimate Windows tool, is a common tactic for executing malicious code undetected. This would facilitate communication with HTTP-based C&C servers. 

Final Answer: A
