Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Scote malware retrieves C2 information from Pastebin or Google+ before communicating with the C2 servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that C2 stands for Command and Control, which is how malware communicates with its operators. The question says that Scote uses legitimate third-party services to host its C2 info. So, the malware is evading detection by using these services.

Now, the options are whether it uses Pastebin or Google+ for this. I remember that Pastebin is a site where people can post text publicly, often used for sharing code snippets or other information. Google+ was a social media platform, but it's been discontinued, so maybe it's less likely to be used now.

I think about how malware typically uses these services. Pastebin is commonly used because it's easy to post and retrieve information without much setup. Malware can check a specific Pastebin post for C2 server addresses. On the other hand, Google+ might have been used for similar purposes, but since it's no longer active, it's probably not used anymore.

So, considering that Pastebin is still around and widely used, it's more plausible that Scote uses Pastebin to retrieve C2 info. Google+ being defunct makes it less likely. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely using Pastebin.

Scote malware likely retrieves C2 information from Pastebin due to its ongoing popularity and ease of use, whereas Google+ is less likely as it's discontinued. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
