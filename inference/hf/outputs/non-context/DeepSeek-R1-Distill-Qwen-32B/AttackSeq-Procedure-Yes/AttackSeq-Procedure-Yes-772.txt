Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether recipients of a spear phishing email with links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery would be presented with a document that looks like a legitimate blog post or report before getting infected. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that spear phishing emails are targeted attacks, often designed to look trustworthy. They usually contain links or attachments that seem relevant to the recipient, like a document from a known organization or a colleague. In this case, the email has links to RTF documents. RTF files are known for being used in exploits because they can contain embedded code that executes when opened.

CVE-2017-8750 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, specifically in the way it handles certain objects. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, which is exactly what attackers would use to deliver malware like QuasarRAT. QuasarRAT is a remote access Trojan, meaning it allows attackers to control the infected machine.

Now, the question is about whether the RTF document would simulate a legitimate blog post or report. Spear phishing often uses social engineering tactics to trick users into opening malicious attachments. The idea is to make the document appear genuine so the recipient doesn't suspect anything. If the RTF is part of a phishing campaign, it's likely designed to look like something the recipient would expect, such as a report or a blog post from a trusted source.

When the recipient clicks the link and opens the RTF, the exploit would trigger CVE-2017-8750, leading to the execution of the payload, which is QuasarRAT. Before the infection happens, the document itself would probably display content that seems legitimate to lower the recipient's defenses. This could be a fake report, a document that appears to be from a known company, or a blog post that the recipient might find interesting or relevant.

So, putting it all together, the RTF document is crafted to look legitimate to trick the user into opening it. The exploit happens upon opening, delivering the RAT. Therefore, it's likely that the document would simulate a legitimate blog post or report before the infection occurs.

The RTF document in the spear phishing email is designed to appear legitimate, such as a blog post or report, to deceive the recipient into opening it. Upon opening, the exploit CVE-2017-8750 is triggered, delivering QuasarRAT. Therefore, the document would simulate a legitimate source before infection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
