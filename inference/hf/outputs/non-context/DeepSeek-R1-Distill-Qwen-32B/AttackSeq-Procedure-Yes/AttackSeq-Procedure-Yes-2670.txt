Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the OceanLotus backdoor would gather system details and send them back using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys after achieving persistence. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that OceanLotus is a known malware, often associated with espionage activities. It's been linked to various cyber-attacks, so understanding its behavior is key here.

The question mentions that OceanLotus has achieved persistence by creating a Launch Agent and launching itself as a service from a new location. Persistence mechanisms are common in malware to ensure they keep running after a system restart. Launch Agents on macOS, for example, are used to start services automatically, so that makes sense.

Now, the next part is about the backdoor gathering system details and sending them back. Typically, after establishing persistence, malware often collects information about the compromised system. This information can include system version, installed software, user accounts, network details, etc. This data helps the attacker understand the environment better and plan further attacks or data exfiltration.

The method mentioned is using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys. Custom protocols are used to avoid detection by standard network monitoring tools, as they don't follow standard protocols like HTTP or FTP. Binary protocols are efficient and can be harder to inspect. Session-based ephemeral keys imply that the encryption keys are generated for each session and are temporary, which enhances security by not reusing keys, making it harder for third parties to decrypt communications if they're intercepted.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, I recall that T1040 is about Network Sniffing, but more relevant here might be T1071.001, which is about Data Exfiltration over Unencrypted Channels. However, using a custom protocol with encryption would actually be a way to avoid detection, so maybe it's more about T1573.001, which is Encrypted Channel for Command and Control. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question is about whether it's likely that OceanLotus would do this. I think that many sophisticated malware use custom protocols to communicate. OceanLotus, being a more advanced threat, probably does use such methods to avoid detection and ensure secure communication with its C2 servers.

So, putting it all together: After achieving persistence, gathering system info is a common next step. Using a custom binary protocol with ephemeral keys makes sense for stealth and security. Therefore, the answer is likely yes.

After establishing persistence, OceanLotus is likely to gather system details and exfiltrate them using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys to maintain stealth and secure communication. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
