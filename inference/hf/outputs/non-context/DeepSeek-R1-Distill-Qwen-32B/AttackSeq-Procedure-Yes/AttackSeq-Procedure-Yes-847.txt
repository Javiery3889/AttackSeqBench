Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether attackers, after the discovery phase, are likely to exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing persistence on new systems. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the MITRE ATT&CK framework outlines various tactics and techniques used by attackers. The discovery phase is part of the initial steps where attackers gather information about the target environment. Once they have enough knowledge, they move on to the next stages.

Lateral movement is a key tactic where attackers move within the network to access other systems. Exploiting remote services, like using RDP or SSH, is a common method for this. After gaining access to a new system, installing persistence mechanisms ensures they can maintain access even if the initial session is disrupted.

So, the sequence would typically be: discovery → lateral movement via remote services → installing persistence. Therefore, the answer should be yes, they are likely to do that.

After the discovery phase, attackers often exploit remote services to move laterally before establishing persistence on new systems. This sequence aligns with typical attack patterns where lateral movement precedes persistence installation.

Final Answer: A: Yes
