Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT malware would use its process discovery and system time discovery capabilities before archiving data using a custom storage format after using defense evasion techniques like process injection and deobfuscation. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that defense evasion techniques like process injection and deobfuscation are often used by malware to hide their presence. Process injection involves running malicious code within a legitimate process to avoid detection, and deobfuscation is about making the code readable after it was obfuscated to hide its true nature.

Once the malware has evaded detection, the next steps usually involve gathering information about the compromised system. Process discovery would help the malware understand what processes are running, which could be useful for identifying targets or avoiding certain processes. System time discovery might be used to check the system's clock, possibly to determine if it's a good time to execute certain actions without being noticed.

After gathering this information, the malware would likely collect data from the system. Once the data is collected, it needs to be stored or transmitted. Archiving the data using a custom storage format makes sense because it allows the malware to organize the data efficiently and possibly encrypt it to avoid detection during transmission.

So, putting it all together: defense evasion (process injection, deobfuscation) → process and system time discovery → data collection → archiving with custom format. This seems like a logical sequence. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The sequence of actions described follows a logical progression for malware behavior. After evading detection, the malware would gather system information before archiving data.
