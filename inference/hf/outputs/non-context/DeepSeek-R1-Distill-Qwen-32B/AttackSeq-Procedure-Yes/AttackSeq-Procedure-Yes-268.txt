Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attack sequence described is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the attack starts by using Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199. I remember that CVE-2017-0199 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, specifically related to the Equation Editor. Exploiting this would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, which is a common method for initial access.

Next, the question says that after exploiting this vulnerability, the attack executed an embedded .hta file using mshta.exe. I know that .hta files are HTML Application files that can execute scripts with the privileges of the user. Mshta.exe is a legitimate Windows utility used to run these .hta files. So, using mshta.exe to execute the .hta file makes sense because it's a common technique to run malicious scripts without needing to save them as executable files, which might raise suspicion.

Then, the attack achieves persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes. I recall that attackers often use legitimate-sounding task names to blend in. 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' sounds like it's related to Google Update, which is a legitimate service. Scheduling a task with such a name would make it harder for the victim or security software to detect it as malicious. Using a VBS file (VBScript) is also a common persistence method because scripts can be executed without needing to write to disk as executables, and they can be scheduled to run at regular intervals.

Putting it all together: Exploiting a Word document vulnerability gives initial access, executing the .hta via mshta.exe runs the malicious payload, and then setting up a scheduled task with a believable name to run a VBS script every 3 minutes ensures persistence. This sequence is plausible because each step uses legitimate tools and methods that attackers commonly employ to maintain access and avoid detection.

I don't see any red flags in this sequence. Each step logically follows the previous one, using known techniques. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The attack sequence described follows a logical and plausible path. The initial exploit via CVE-2017-0199 in Microsoft Word allows execution of arbitrary code, which is then used to run an embedded .hta file via mshta.exe. This step is common for executing scripts without raising suspicion. Finally, scheduling a task with a legitimate-sounding name to run a VBS file ensures persistence, a typical tactic for maintaining access undetected. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
