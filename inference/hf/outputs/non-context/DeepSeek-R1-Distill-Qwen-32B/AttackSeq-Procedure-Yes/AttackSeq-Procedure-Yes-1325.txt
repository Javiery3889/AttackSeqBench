Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke, after searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types in the discovery phase, is likely to use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the information via FTP. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the context. CosmicDuke is a threat group, and I'm assuming they're involved in some cyber-attack activities. The question is about their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in a specific attack sequence.

The attack sequence described has two main steps: 

1. Searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types during the discovery phase.
2. Using a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating via FTP.

I need to determine if these two steps make sense in sequence and if they align with known TTPs of CosmicDuke or similar groups.

Let me break it down.

First, the discovery phase. Searching removable drives for files suggests that the attackers are looking for specific data. Skipping certain file types might mean they're targeting particular file extensions, like .docx, .xlsx, or .pdf, which are common for sensitive information. This is a common tactic in data exfiltration attacksâ€”targeting removable drives because they can be an easy way to transfer data out of a network or to gather information from a compromised system.

Next, using a clipboard stealer. Clipboard stealers are tools that capture data copied to the clipboard, which can include sensitive information like credentials, tokens, or other data that users might copy and paste. This technique is often used in attacks to gather information that isn't stored in files, such as login credentials entered into web forms or other transient data.

Exfiltration via FTP is a common method for attackers to transfer stolen data. FTP is an older protocol and might not be as secure, making it a target for misuse. However, more sophisticated attackers might use encrypted channels, but FTP is still used in some cases, especially if the attackers are trying to blend in or if the target environment doesn't monitor FTP traffic closely.

Now, considering the sequence: after searching removable drives, using a clipboard stealer. Does this make sense? Well, the discovery phase is about gathering information, so after searching for files, using a clipboard stealer could be a way to collect additional data that wasn't found in the files. It's a complementary technique. So, the sequence seems plausible.

But I should also think about whether CosmicDuke is known to use clipboard stealers. I'm not entirely sure about their specific TTPs, but clipboard stealing is a known technique in the cyber threat landscape. Groups involved in espionage or data theft often use multiple methods to gather as much information as possible.

Another angle: the use of FTP for exfiltration. If the attackers have already gathered data from removable drives and the clipboard, they might use FTP to send this data out. It's a straightforward method, though perhaps not the most secure or stealthy. However, if the network allows FTP traffic, it could be an effective way to exfiltrate data without raising too many flags.

So, putting it all together: the sequence of searching removable drives, using a clipboard stealer, and exfiltrating via FTP seems plausible. Each step complements the previous one, gathering different types of data and using a common exfiltration method.

I don't see any immediate red flags that would make this sequence unlikely. It's a logical progression in an attack where the goal is to collect as much sensitive information as possible from a compromised system.

The sequence described involves CosmicDuke using a clipboard stealer after searching removable drives, followed by exfiltration via FTP. This progression is plausible as each step complements the previous one, gathering different types of data and using a common exfiltration method. Clipboard stealers are known techniques in cyber-attacks, and FTP is a straightforward method for data transfer. Therefore, the sequence aligns with typical TTPs for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
