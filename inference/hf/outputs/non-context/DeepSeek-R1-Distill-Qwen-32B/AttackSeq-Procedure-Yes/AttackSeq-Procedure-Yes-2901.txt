Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT15 would deploy backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS after using Mimikatz and stealing a VPN certificate. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Mimikatz is a tool used for credential dumping. So, APT15 used it to get domain admin credentials. That makes sense because having those credentials gives them high-level access to the network. Then, they stole a VPN certificate, which probably allowed them to access the network remotely without being detected as easily.

Now, the question is about whether they would deploy specific backdoors. I remember that backdoors are used to maintain persistent access to a compromised system. So, after gaining initial access and escalating privileges, deploying backdoors is a common next step for attackers to ensure they can return or maintain control.

Looking at the backdoors mentioned: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. I think these are all known backdoors associated with APT15. RoyalCLI, in particular, is designed to bypass command prompt policy settings. That means if the system has restrictions on using command prompts, RoyalCLI can still execute commands, which is a way to maintain persistence and control.

So, the sequence makes sense. After obtaining credentials and remote access, deploying backdoors to ensure continued access is logical. Using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policies would help them execute commands without being restricted, which is a smart move for maintaining persistence.

I don't see any reason why they wouldn't do this. It aligns with typical APT behavior of establishing multiple backdoors and ensuring they can maintain access despite security measures. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The scenario describes APT15 using Mimikatz to obtain high-level credentials and a VPN certificate for remote access. Deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS is a logical next step to maintain persistence. RoyalCLI's ability to bypass command prompt policies supports continued access despite restrictions. This aligns with APT behavior, making the sequence plausible.

Final Answer: A
