Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Hidden Cobra would develop the Bankshot implants with certain capabilities under the tactic of Resource Development. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that Hidden Cobra targeted Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878. I know that CVE-2018-4878 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows remote code execution, which is often used in initial access attacks. So, the initial access vector here is clear.

Now, the question is about whether Hidden Cobra would develop Bankshot implants with the ability to give full control and wipe files under the tactic of Resource Development. I need to recall what the MITRE ATT&CK framework says about tactics and techniques.

Resource Development is a tactic in MITRE ATT&CK, which refers to the development of tools, infrastructure, and other resources to support operations. This could include creating or modifying tools, setting up command and control servers, or developing new attack techniques.

Bankshot is a known implant associated with Hidden Cobra, which is also known as the Lazarus Group. From what I remember, Bankshot is a sophisticated implant used for various purposes, including data exfiltration, system control, and destruction. It's been used in attacks against financial institutions, so that aligns with the scenario here.

The question is whether developing such implants falls under Resource Development. Since Resource Development involves creating or enhancing tools, yes, developing Bankshot would fit here. The capabilities mentioned—full control and file wiping—are typical for such implants, which are part of the attackers' toolset.

So, putting it together: the initial access via CVE-2018-4878 is the first step, and then using Bankshot under Resource Development makes sense as the next step in their attack lifecycle. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The scenario involves Hidden Cobra using a known exploit for initial access and then employing a sophisticated implant, which aligns with the Resource Development tactic as it involves tool creation. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
