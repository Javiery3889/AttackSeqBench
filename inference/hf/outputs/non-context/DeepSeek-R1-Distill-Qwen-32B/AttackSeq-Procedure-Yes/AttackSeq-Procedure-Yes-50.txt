Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the scenario described is likely to involve communication with C2 servers and downloading payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that a PowerShell script is evading defenses by operating in memory. That makes sense because using memory (in-memory execution) is a common tactic to avoid detection since it doesn't write files to the disk, which can be picked up by antivirus or other security tools. The script is using the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880. I'm not exactly sure what that specific DCOM object is, but I know that DCOM is often used for legitimate purposes, but attackers can abuse it to execute code remotely or locally without writing to disk.

So, the script is executing files in memory, which is a known technique. Now, the question is whether this script is likely to communicate with command and control (C2) servers next. Well, after initial execution, many malware use PowerShell to reach out to their C2 servers. This is a common step because once they're in memory, they can send information back to the attackers and receive further instructions or additional payloads.

Now, the payloads mentioned are Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. I know that Ursnif is a banking Trojan that's been around for a while. It's used to steal credentials, banking information, and can also act as a downloader for other malware. GandCrab is a ransomware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption keys. Both are typically delivered through various methods, including phishing emails, exploit kits, or other malware that acts as a downloader.

Putting this together, if the PowerShell script is evading detection and executing in memory, it's likely part of an initial access or lateral movement phase. Once it's established, it would probably reach out to the C2 server to get further instructions. Since both Ursnif and GandCrab are known to be distributed via such methods, it's plausible that the script would download these payloads.

I should also consider the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The techniques mentioned here align with several tactics. For example, using DCOM for execution is part of the Execution tactic (T1559.001). Operating in memory is part of the Defense Evasion tactic (T1055). Communicating with C2 is part of the Command and Control tactic (T1573). Downloading additional payloads would be part of the Lateral Movement or Collection tactics, depending on the context.

So, the sequence makes sense: evade detection by using in-memory execution, then communicate with C2 to get more malware. Therefore, the answer is likely yes.

The scenario involves a PowerShell script evading detection by executing in memory using a specific DCOM object. This technique is common in attacks to avoid detection. After establishing a foothold, the script is likely to communicate with a C2 server to receive further instructions or payloads. Given that both Ursnif and GandCrab are known to be distributed via such methods, it is plausible that the script would download these payloads. The sequence aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactics, supporting the likelihood of this scenario.

Final Answer: A: Yes
