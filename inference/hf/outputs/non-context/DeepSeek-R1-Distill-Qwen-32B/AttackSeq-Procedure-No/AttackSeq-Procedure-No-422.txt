Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails is likely to exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question is referring to. The campaign uses phishing emails with a malicious Word document, 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. Phishing emails are a common initial access vector, so that makes sense. The question is about whether they would then exploit a specific vulnerability in FortiOS devices, which is CVE-2018-13379.

I remember that CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in FortiOS, specifically related to the SSL VPN module. It allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code, which can lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability was patched in 2018, so if a device is not updated, it's still exploitable.

Now, considering the attack sequence: initial access via phishing, then moving to exploit FortiOS. Phishing emails often deliver malware or credential theft. Once initial access is gained, attackers might look for internal vulnerabilities to escalate privileges or move laterally.

But wait, FortiOS is a firewall device, typically used for network security. If the phishing attack is targeting end-users, the next step might be to compromise their systems, not necessarily the firewall. Unless the attackers have specific access to the network, they might not target the firewall immediately.

Alternatively, if the phishing attack is part of a larger campaign aiming to breach a network, they might use the initial access to move laterally. But exploiting FortiOS would require specific knowledge of the network architecture and the presence of vulnerable FortiOS devices. It's possible but not the most common next step after a phishing email.

Moreover, CVE-2018-13379 is a high-severity vulnerability, but it's also known and patched. If the network has updated their FortiOS devices, the exploit wouldn't work. So, unless the attackers have intelligence that the target is using an unpatched FortiOS, they might not waste resources on that exploit.

Another angle: sometimes attackers use multiple techniques. After initial access, they might use credential theft to access internal systems, including management interfaces. If they can access the FortiOS management interface, they could exploit CVE-2018-13379. But that would require gaining access to the management credentials first, which might be a separate step.

So, putting it all together: while it's possible, it's not the most likely immediate next step after a phishing email. More common would be using the phishing to install malware, steal credentials, or move laterally within the network. Exploiting FortiOS would depend on the target's specific setup and whether the attackers have the necessary information and tools.

Therefore, I think the answer is B: No, it's not likely that they would exploit CVE-2018-13379 right after the phishing attack. They might, but it's not the most probable next step.
</think>

The question involves determining whether a phishing campaign using a malicious Word document would likely exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after initial access. 

1. **Initial Access**: Phishing emails with 'Richard_Johnson.doc' are a common method for initial access, often leading to malware or credential theft.
2. **FortiOS Exploit**: CVE-2018-13379 is a high-severity vulnerability in FortiOS, allowing remote code execution. However, it requires specific conditions, such as unpatched devices and access to the management interface.
3. **Likelihood Analysis**: While possible, exploiting FortiOS is not the most immediate next step after phishing. Attackers typically focus on malware deployment, credential theft, or lateral movement before targeting network devices like firewalls.
4. **Conclusion**: The exploit is possible but not the most probable next step, as it depends on the target's network setup and whether the vulnerability exists.

Final Answer: B
