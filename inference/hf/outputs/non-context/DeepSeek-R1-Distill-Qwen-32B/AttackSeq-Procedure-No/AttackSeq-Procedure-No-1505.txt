Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether proxy servers are likely to be used by RIG EK after they've used an encrypted exploit code with a custom RC4 algorithm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that RIG EK is a known exploit kit, and exploit kits often use various techniques to avoid detection. The question mentions that they're using a custom version of RC4 for encryption in their command and control (C2) operations. RC4 is a stream cipher that's been around for a while, and while it's not the most secure by today's standards, it's still used because it's fast and easy to implement. Using a custom version might mean they're trying to make their encryption unique, perhaps to avoid detection by security tools that look for standard RC4 usage.

Now, the question is about whether proxy servers are likely to be part of their infrastructure to make infections harder to detect. Proxy servers can serve multiple purposes in an attack. They can help mask the origin of the attack, making it harder to trace back to the attackers. They can also add layers of encryption or obfuscation, which can make network traffic analysis more difficult. Additionally, using proxies can help in bypassing certain network security measures like firewalls or intrusion detection systems that might block direct connections.

In the context of RIG EK, which is an exploit kit, the use of encrypted channels for C2 is a common tactic. Encrypting the communication ensures that the data being sent back and forth isn't easily readable by defenders, which helps in maintaining persistence and control over the compromised systems without being detected. However, encryption alone isn't always enough to avoid detection. Security teams can still monitor encrypted traffic for patterns or unusual behavior, even if they can't decrypt it.

Using proxy servers adds another layer of complexity. By routing traffic through proxies, the attackers can make the traffic appear as if it's coming from different locations or legitimate sources. This can make it harder for defenders to identify the true origin of the malicious traffic. Moreover, if the proxies are part of a larger network or use fast flux techniques, the domains or IP addresses used for C2 can change rapidly, making it difficult for defenders to block or track them.

I also recall that many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and sophisticated malware use proxy servers or similar techniques to hide their infrastructure. For example, they might use compromised legitimate servers as proxies, or they might employ a chain of proxies to obscure their trail. This is part of their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to evade detection and analysis.

So, putting it all together, RIG EK is already using encryption to secure their C2 communications. Adding proxy servers would complement this by making the overall infrastructure more resilient against detection. It's a common practice in cyberattacks to use multiple layers of obfuscation and evasion, so it's quite plausible that they would use proxies as part of their strategy.

Therefore, the answer should be that yes, proxy servers are likely to be used in their infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

RIG EK's use of a custom RC4 algorithm for encrypted C2 communications indicates a focus on evading detection. Proxy servers can further obscure the attack's origin and traffic, making infections harder to trace. This aligns with common TTPs used by sophisticated attackers to enhance evasion. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
