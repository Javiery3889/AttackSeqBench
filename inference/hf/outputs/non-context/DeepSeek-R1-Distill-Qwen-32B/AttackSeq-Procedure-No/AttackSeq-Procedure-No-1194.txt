Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether ComboJack, after ensuring persistence and hiding itself, would store output in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory before replacing wallet addresses. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that ComboJack is a type of malware, specifically a banking Trojan. From what I remember, banking Trojans are designed to steal banking credentials and other sensitive information. They often use various techniques to maintain persistence on a victim's system and hide their activities to avoid detection.

The question mentions that ComboJack sets a registry key for persistence. That makes sense because many malware use the Windows Registry to ensure they run at startup. Then, it uses attrib.exe to hide itself. Attrib.exe is a legitimate Windows tool that can change file attributes, so using it to hide files or directories is a common tactic to avoid detection.

Next, the question asks if ComboJack would store output from command execution in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory. I'm not entirely sure about this part. I know that some malware use temporary directories to store data because it's a common place where files are stored temporarily and might not be as closely monitored. A .dat file is a generic data file, so it's plausible that malware would use such a file to store information temporarily.

Then, the question states that ComboJack would replace legitimate wallet addresses with a hardcoded wallet address to redirect funds. This is a typical behavior for banking Trojans. They often inject malicious code into banking websites to steal credentials or redirect transactions to the attacker's wallet.

Putting it all together: persistence via registry, hiding with attrib.exe, storing output in a .dat file in %TEMP%, then modifying wallet addresses. Each step seems to follow logically. The .dat file storage would be a way to temporarily hold data before it's used for malicious purposes, like modifying wallet addresses.

I don't see any immediate red flags in this sequence. It aligns with how many banking Trojans operate, using persistence, stealth, data storage, and then executing the payload. So, I think the answer is yes, it's likely.

The sequence described aligns with typical banking Trojan behavior. ComboJack uses persistence via the registry, hides itself, stores data temporarily, and then executes its payload.
