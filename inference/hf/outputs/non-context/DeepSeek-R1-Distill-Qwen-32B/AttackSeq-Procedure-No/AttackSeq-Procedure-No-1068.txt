Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the data collected by Yellow Garuda using a Telegram 'grabber' tool is likely to be divided into fixed-size chunks for exfiltration to avoid detection. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what Yellow Garuda is. From what I remember, Yellow Garuda is a cyber threat group, possibly involved in espionage or data theft. They use various tools to collect information from victims, and in this case, they're using a Telegram grabber. Telegram is a messaging app, so the grabber would likely extract messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from the victim's account.

Now, the question is about whether the data collected would be split into fixed-size chunks when exfiltrated. Exfiltration is the process of transferring stolen data out of a network, often to avoid detection. Cybercriminals and attackers use various techniques to make this process less noticeable.

I know that when data is exfiltrated, especially in large quantities, it's common to split it into smaller chunks. This is because sending large amounts of data at once can be more easily detected by network monitoring tools. By breaking the data into smaller, fixed-size pieces, the attackers can spread the data transfer over time or across different channels, making it harder for security systems to notice the unusual activity.

Fixed-size chunks are a specific method where each piece of data is the same size. This can help in managing the transfer process, ensuring that each chunk is within a certain size limit that's less likely to raise alarms. It's a tactic used to blend in with normal network traffic, which might have a variety of packet sizes, but consistent small chunks can sometimes go unnoticed.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on what I know about exfiltration techniques, especially in the context of cyber espionage groups, it's quite common to use such methods. Groups like Yellow Garuda, which are likely sophisticated, would employ these tactics to avoid detection. They wouldn't want to send large amounts of data all at once because that could trigger alerts or arouse suspicion.

Additionally, using a grabber tool suggests that they're collecting a significant amount of data, which would need to be exfiltrated efficiently. Splitting it into chunks makes the process more manageable and less likely to be detected. So, it makes sense that they would divide the data into fixed-size chunks.

I don't see any reason why they wouldn't do this. If they sent the data as one large file, it would be more conspicuous. Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

The analysis indicates that Yellow Garuda, a sophisticated cyber threat group, would likely use fixed-size chunks to exfiltrate data collected from Telegram accounts. This method helps evade detection by making the data transfer less noticeable. 

Final Answer: A
