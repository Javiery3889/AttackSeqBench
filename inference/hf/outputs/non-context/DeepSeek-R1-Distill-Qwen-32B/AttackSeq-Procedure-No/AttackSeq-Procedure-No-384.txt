Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT15 would retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using the enum_secrets module before deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Mimikatz is a tool often used in cyberattacks to extract credentials, especially in Windows environments. If APT15 uses Mimikatz to gain domain admin credentials, they're likely trying to escalate privileges within the network. Once they have those high-level credentials, their next moves would probably involve lateral movement or further exploitation.

Now, the question is about whether they would then use the enum_secrets module to retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. I'm not entirely sure about the enum_secrets module, but I think it's part of some toolset used for credential dumping. AWS Secrets Manager is a service where sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc., are stored. If the target organization uses AWS, having access to Secrets Manager could give the attackers a lot of valuable information.

After obtaining these secrets, the next step mentioned is deploying backdoors. Backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS are used to maintain persistent access to the compromised systems. So, the sequence would be: gain domain admin credentials, extract more sensitive information, then set up backdoors to ensure continued access.

I'm trying to recall if APT15 typically follows this sequence. APT15 is known for targeting various industries, including government and technology sectors. They often use living off the land techniques and may use tools like Mimikatz. Deploying backdoors is a common tactic to maintain persistence after initial access.

So, putting it together: after gaining domain admin access, using a module to extract more secrets makes sense because it provides more credentials and access to sensitive data. Then, deploying backdoors would be the logical next step to ensure they can return or maintain control without being detected.

I don't see any reason why they wouldn't do this. It seems like a logical progression in an attack chain. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The sequence of actions described aligns with typical APT15 tactics. After using Mimikatz to gain domain admin credentials, retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using the enum_secrets module would provide additional sensitive information. Deploying backdoors follows logically to maintain persistence.
