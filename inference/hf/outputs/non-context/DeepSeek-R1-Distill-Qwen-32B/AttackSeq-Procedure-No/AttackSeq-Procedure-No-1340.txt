Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers likely rebooted the target system after completing their wiping processes instead of launching DDoS attacks. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files from the DDoS C2 servers. That suggests that the attackers were using some form of encryption or encoding to hide their configuration data. Using XOR with different keys might mean they changed their encryption method or key at some point, possibly to avoid detection or to indicate a change in their attack phase.

The main question is whether, after the wiping processes, the attackers rebooted the system instead of launching DDoS attacks against specific targets like democracy-promoting websites in Hong Kong, which caused Next Media's network to fail. So, the options are whether they rebooted or proceeded with the DDoS.

I need to think about the typical attack sequence. Usually, attackers have certain objectives. If their goal was to disrupt services, they might perform wiping (like deleting data or causing system damage) and then launch DDoS to take down websites. Alternatively, if they wanted to ensure their malware was removed or to clean up, they might reboot the system to stop their own processes.

But in this case, the question is whether they rebooted instead of launching DDoS. So, if they rebooted, that would mean they didn't proceed with the DDoS attacks. But the question states that the DDoS attacks did happen, causing Next Media's network to fail. So, if the DDoS attacks occurred, that suggests they didn't reboot but instead continued their attack sequence.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, "is it likely that attackers rebooted the target system once the various wiping processes were complete instead of launching DDoS attacks..." So, the alternative is rebooting vs. launching DDoS. If they rebooted, they wouldn't have launched the DDoS. But the question implies that the DDoS did happen because it caused Next Media's network to fail. So, if the DDoS happened, they didn't reboot.

Alternatively, maybe the wiping processes were part of a cleanup before DDoS. But the use of two different XOR keys might indicate a change in tactics or phases. Maybe after wiping, they changed their encryption method and then proceeded with DDoS.

But the key point is whether they rebooted instead of launching DDoS. If they rebooted, they wouldn't have launched DDoS. But since the DDoS did happen, they must not have rebooted. Therefore, the answer would be No, it's not likely they rebooted; instead, they launched the DDoS attacks.

Wait, but the question is a bit confusing. It says, "is it likely that attackers rebooted... instead of launching DDoS attacks..." So, if they rebooted, they wouldn't have launched DDoS. But the DDoS did happen, so they didn't reboot. Therefore, the answer is No, it's not likely they rebooted; they proceeded with DDoS.

Alternatively, maybe the two XOR keys indicate two different phases. Perhaps after wiping, they rebooted to start a new phase, but that doesn't align with the DDoS happening. Hmm.

I think the main point is that since the DDoS attacks occurred, they didn't reboot. So the answer is B: No.
</think>

The question asks whether attackers likely rebooted the target system after wiping processes instead of launching DDoS attacks. The analysis indicates that since the DDoS attacks did occur, causing Next Media's network failure, the attackers did not reboot but proceeded with their intended actions. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B
