Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts to download additional malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The question describes an attack sequence where the backdoor evades defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts. This suggests that the malware is using a common technique to execute malicious code without being detected by traditional antivirus software. Once the encoded blobs are decoded, they execute PowerShell scripts that download more malware onto the victim's machine.

Now, the question is about whether this backdoor is likely to steal browser cookies from Chrome and Safari. I know that browser cookies are often targeted by malware because they can contain sensitive information like session tokens, which can be used for unauthorized access to user accounts.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK framework, I recall that there are specific tactics and techniques related to credential theft. For example, T1530 is about OS Credential Dumping, which involves extracting credentials directly from the operating system. However, browser cookies are more about web-based credentials, so I think there's a specific technique for that. I believe it's T1530.001, which is OS Credential Dumping: OS Credential Dumping - Web Credentials. This technique involves extracting credentials from web browsers, which aligns with stealing cookies.

So, if the backdoor is already executing PowerShell scripts to download additional malware, it's plausible that one of those scripts or the additional malware could include functionality to steal browser cookies. This would fit into the broader attack pattern of credential theft to gain unauthorized access.

I should also consider the purpose of the backdoor. Dropping Elephant, if it's a known backdoor, might have specific capabilities. However, since I don't have specific information on Dropping Elephant, I can generalize based on common backdoor functionalities. Many backdoors do include credential theft as part of their modus operandi to escalate privileges or move laterally within a network.

Additionally, using PowerShell to execute scripts is a common method for downloading additional payloads, which could include modules for credential extraction. So, the sequence makes sense: evade defenses, execute scripts, download malware, and then use that malware to steal cookies.

Therefore, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, it's likely that the backdoor would steal browser cookies as part of its attack sequence.

The scenario involves a backdoor evading defenses using PowerShell scripts to download additional malware. Browser cookies are a common target for credential theft, fitting the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1530.001. Given the attack sequence and typical backdoor functionalities, it's plausible that the malware would steal cookies. 

Final Answer: A
