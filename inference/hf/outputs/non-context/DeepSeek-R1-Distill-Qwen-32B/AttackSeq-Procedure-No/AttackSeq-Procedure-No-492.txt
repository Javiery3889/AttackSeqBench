Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon would use the FTP protocol for command and control (C2) communication after capturing screenshots. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that FTP is an older protocol used for transferring files over a network. It's not very secure because it doesn't encrypt data, and it's not commonly used for C2 these days. Most modern malware uses more sophisticated and stealthy methods.

Backdoor.Graphon is a custom backdoor, so its behavior can vary, but generally, custom malware tends to use more advanced C2 methods to avoid detection. They might use HTTP, HTTPS, or even DNS for communication because these are more common and can blend in better with regular traffic.

Cobalt Strike Beacon is a well-known tool in the cybersecurity world. From what I remember, Cobalt Strike typically uses HTTP or HTTPS for C2. It's designed to mimic normal web traffic to avoid being caught by network defenses. Using FTP would be unusual because it's less common and might raise red flags.

Also, considering the use of a custom screenshot tool, the attackers are likely trying to be stealthy. Using FTP for C2 would be risky because it's not encrypted and could be easily monitored. They'd probably prefer encrypted channels to keep their activities hidden.

So putting it all together, it's unlikely that either Backdoor.Graphon or Cobalt Strike Beacon would use FTP for C2. They're more likely to use HTTP, HTTPS, or other protocols that are more secure and blend in better with normal network traffic.

The analysis indicates that both Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon are unlikely to use FTP for C2 communication. Modern malware typically avoids FTP due to its lack of encryption and stealth, opting instead for more secure and inconspicuous methods like HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
