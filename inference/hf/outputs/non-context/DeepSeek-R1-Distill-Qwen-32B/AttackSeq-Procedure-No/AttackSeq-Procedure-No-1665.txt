Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TDrop2 malware would engage in discovery activities after initial access via spear-phishing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the initial access is through spear-phishing emails with trojanized executables. That makes sense because spear-phishing is a common method for delivering malware. Once the executable is run, the malware would likely start its operations.

Now, the question is about whether TDrop2 would perform discovery activities like gathering system info and network views before using process hollowing for execution. I remember that process hollowing is a technique where malware injects code into a legitimate process to hide its activity. But before that, the malware probably needs to know the environment it's in.

I think about the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The initial access is T1566.002 (Phishing for Malware). After that, the next steps often involve discovery. So, T1082 (System Information Discovery) and T1018 (Network Service Scanning) are common. These activities help the attacker understand the network and system to plan further attacks.

Process hollowing falls under T1093 (Process Injection). Typically, attackers perform discovery before moving laterally or escalating privileges. So, the sequence would be: initial access, discovery, then execution techniques like process hollowing.

Looking at the answer choices, A is Yes and B is No. Since the question is asking if it's likely, and based on the typical attack flow, the answer should be Yes. TDrop2 would likely gather info before using process hollowing to hide its execution.

The malware TDrop2, after gaining initial access through spear-phishing, would likely perform discovery activities to understand the environment before using process hollowing to execute malicious code. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's typical attack sequence, where discovery precedes execution techniques.

Final Answer: A
