Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke captures credentials from a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts after targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what CosmicDuke is. From what I remember, CosmicDuke is a type of malware, specifically a backdoor, which means it's designed to maintain access to a compromised system. It's often used by attackers to gather information and control the infected machine.

The question mentions that CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives for discovery. So, the initial step here is that the malware is looking through these drives to find information. That makes sense because attackers typically want to gather as much data as possible once they've breached a system.

Now, the next part is about capturing credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page. Ivanti Connect Secure is a legitimate software used for remote access and file sharing. If an attacker manipulates its login page, they might be setting up a phishing scenario where users enter their credentials into a fake page, which then captures those credentials for the attacker.

So, the question is whether CosmicDuke would do this as part of its collection efforts. I know that some malware has keylogging capabilities, which can capture keystrokes, including login credentials. Alternatively, some malware might inject malicious code into legitimate websites to capture data entered there.

I should check if CosmicDuke is known for such behavior. From what I recall, CosmicDuke is primarily a backdoor, but it's often used in conjunction with other tools. It might not have built-in keylogging, but attackers using CosmicDuke could deploy additional modules or scripts to capture credentials. Alternatively, they might use social engineering tactics, like phishing, to trick users into giving up their credentials.

In this case, the scenario describes a manipulated login page, which suggests a phishing attack. So, the attacker would need to either redirect users to a fake page or manipulate the legitimate page to capture inputs. If CosmicDuke is used in this context, it might be part of a larger campaign where the malware is used to maintain access and exfiltrate data, including credentials captured through such methods.

I should also consider the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The relevant tactics here would be credential access (TA0006) and collection (TA0009). Specifically, techniques like OS Credential Dumping (T1003) or Stealing Web Session Cookies (T1530) might be involved. However, capturing credentials from a manipulated login page would more likely fall under Phishing for Credentials (T1566) or perhaps Web Session Cookie Theft (T1530).

Since CosmicDuke is a backdoor, it might not directly perform the phishing but could be used to exfiltrate the captured credentials once they're obtained through other means. Alternatively, the malware could be part of a campaign that includes such phishing activities.

Putting it all together, it's plausible that CosmicDuke is used in an attack where credentials are captured from a manipulated login page. The malware's role might be to facilitate the exfiltration of those credentials or to maintain persistence while other tools handle the credential capture.

So, considering all this, the answer would likely be yes, it is probable that CosmicDuke captures such credentials as part of its collection efforts.

CosmicDuke, as a backdoor malware, is typically used to maintain access and exfiltrate data. While it may not inherently capture credentials from a manipulated login page, it is plausible that it is part of a broader campaign where such credential theft occurs. Attackers using CosmicDuke might employ additional tools or phishing tactics to capture credentials, which CosmicDuke then helps exfiltrate. Therefore, it is likely that CosmicDuke is involved in such collection efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
