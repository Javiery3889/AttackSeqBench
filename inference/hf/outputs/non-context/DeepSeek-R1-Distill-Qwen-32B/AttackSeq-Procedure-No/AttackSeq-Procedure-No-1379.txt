Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Scote malware used Pastebin links and Google+ profiles to collect C2 information after the initial phishing phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that attackers used Arabic language decoy documents in a phishing strategy during the initial access phase. That makes sense because phishing often uses enticing documents to trick victims into opening them, which then leads to malware deployment.

Now, the question is about whether Scote malware, after this initial access, collected C2 info specifically from Pastebin and Google+. I'm not too familiar with Scote malware, but I know that malware typically uses various methods to establish command and control (C2) communication. Common methods include hardcoding C2 domains, using domain generation algorithms (DGAs), or fetching C2 info from external sources like social media, pastebin, or other websites.

I remember that some malware uses social media platforms or paste sites to dynamically retrieve C2 information. This helps attackers avoid static domains that can be easily blocked. So, if Scote is doing this, it would be a way to keep the C2 infrastructure flexible and resilient against takedowns.

But wait, the question is whether it's likely that Scote used Pastebin and Google+ specifically. I'm not sure if Scote is known for using these exact sources. I think some malware uses Twitter, GitHub, or other platforms, but Pastebin and Google+ might be less common. Also, Google+ has been phased out, so maybe it's not a primary source anymore.

Moreover, the initial access phase is about getting into the network, and the C2 phase is about maintaining access. So, after the initial phishing, the malware would need to reach out for instructions. If Scote uses these specific sources, it would be part of its persistence mechanism.

However, without specific knowledge about Scote's behavior, I can't be certain. But generally, using such sources is plausible. So, considering the options, the answer would depend on whether Scote is known to use these methods.

Wait, I think I read somewhere that Scote uses Pastebin for C2, but I'm not sure about Google+. If it's only using these two, maybe it's less likely because attackers might have multiple fallbacks. But the question says "only afterwards," so if Scote only uses these two, that might be a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is no because Scote might use other methods as well, making the statement too restrictive. Or perhaps the initial access and C2 are separate steps, so the sequence is correct, but the specific sources are not accurate.

I'm a bit confused, but leaning towards it being plausible, so maybe the answer is yes. But I'm not entirely sure.

The question revolves around whether the Scote malware, after an initial phishing phase using Arabic decoy documents, is likely to collect C2 information exclusively from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles. 

1. **Initial Access Phase**: The use of Arabic decoy documents in phishing is a common tactic to entice victims, leading to malware deployment.

2. **C2 Communication Methods**: Malware often uses various methods for C2, including external sources like Pastebin or social media. These methods allow flexibility and resilience against takedowns.

3. **Specificity of Sources**: While some malware uses platforms like Pastebin, the use of Google+ is less likely due to its phase-out. Additionally, Scote's specific behavior isn't well-documented in this context.

4. **Likelihood of Exclusivity**: The statement specifies "only" Pastebin and Google+, which might be too restrictive. Malware typically has multiple fallbacks or methods.

**Conclusion**: Given the uncertainty about Scote's specific use of these sources and the exclusivity implied, the answer leans towards it being unlikely.

Final Answer: B: No
