Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT15 would use RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS before Mimikatz in their attack sequence. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that APT15 is a known advanced persistent threat group, often linked to Chinese state-sponsored activities. They typically target government and military organizations, among others. Their tactics usually involve a combination of initial access, lateral movement, and credential theft to maintain persistence.

The question mentions that they gained initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain admin credentials. That makes sense because having domain admin access gives them a lot of power within the network. Once they're in, their next steps would likely involve establishing a foothold and moving laterally.

RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS are tools associated with APT15. RoyalCLI is a command-line tool used for executing commands on remote systems, and RoyalDNS is a DNS tool that can be used for command and control (C2) purposes. These tools are typically used for execution evasion and command execution. Execution evasion would involve running malicious code without being detected, and command execution would allow them to carry out specific actions on compromised systems.

Mimikatz, on the other hand, is a well-known tool for credential dumping. It's often used to extract plaintext credentials from memory, which can then be used for lateral movement within the network. So, the sequence would likely be: gain initial access, use tools to execute commands and evade detection, then dump credentials to move laterally.

In this scenario, after initial access, using RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS makes sense because they need to establish a way to control the compromised systems and possibly set up a more persistent presence. Once they have that, they can then use Mimikatz to gather more credentials, which would help them move to other parts of the network or escalate privileges further.

So, putting it all together, the sequence would be: initial access, execution evasion and command execution with Royal tools, then credential dumping with Mimikatz. Therefore, the answer should be yes, they are likely to deploy those tools in that order.

The sequence of actions by APT15 after initial access would logically involve using RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for establishing control and evading detection before employing Mimikatz for credential dumping to facilitate lateral movement.
