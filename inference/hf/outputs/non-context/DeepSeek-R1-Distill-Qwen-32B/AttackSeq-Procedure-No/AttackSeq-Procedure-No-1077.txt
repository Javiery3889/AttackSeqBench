Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the sequence of TTPs described in the question is likely. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that after the PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server via the domain hxxp://outl00k[.]net, the campaign would then execute PowerShell scripts triggered by a macro in a Word document and use obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion. The options are Yes or No.

I know that PRB-Backdoor is a type of malware, often used in cyberattacks. Typically, such malware might use a Word document with a macro as an initial infection vector. The macro, when enabled, would execute some code, maybe downloading additional payloads or establishing a backdoor.

In the scenario, after the backdoor communicates with the C&C server, the next step is executing PowerShell scripts via the macro. That makes sense because macros can be used to run scripts, and PowerShell is a common tool for attackers due to its flexibility and ability to perform various tasks on a system.

Obfuscating the macro scripts is also a common tactic for defense evasion. Attackers obfuscate code to avoid detection by antivirus software or security tools. So, using obfuscated macros would help the malware stay under the radar.

Putting it together: The initial infection is via a macro in a Word document. The macro triggers the backdoor, which communicates with the C&C. Then, the campaign uses the same macro to execute PowerShell scripts, which are obfuscated to evade detection. This seems like a plausible sequence because each step logically follows the previous one, using common techniques in malware campaigns.

I don't see any red flags here. The steps align with typical attack patterns, so the answer should be Yes.

The scenario describes a plausible sequence of events in a cyberattack. The PRB-Backdoor uses a macro in a Word document to establish communication with the C&C server. Subsequently, the macro triggers PowerShell scripts, which are obfuscated to evade detection. This sequence aligns with common attack tactics, making it likely.

Final Answer: A
