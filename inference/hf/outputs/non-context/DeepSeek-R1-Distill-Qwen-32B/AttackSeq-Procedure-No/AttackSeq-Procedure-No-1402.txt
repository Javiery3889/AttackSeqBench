Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy after using native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that FIN13 is a cybercriminal group known for ransomware attacks, specifically using AvosLocker. Their typical modus operandi involves several steps, including initial access, discovery, lateral movement, data collection, and then ransomware deployment.

The question mentions that they've already used native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during the discovery phase. That makes sense because using native tools helps them blend in and avoid detection. Once they've gathered enough information about the network, the next logical step would be lateral movement to spread their attack further.

Now, the question is about whether they would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for moving AvosLocker and other tools across the network. I remember that PDQ Deploy is a legitimate tool used for deploying software across multiple machines. Attackers sometimes abuse such tools because they're already present in many organizations and can be used to distribute malware without raising immediate suspicion.

So, after discovery, lateral movement is a key step. Using PDQ Deploy would allow them to efficiently spread their ransomware and tools to other machines. This would make it easier to collect data from network shares and target specific information for fraudulent activities, which aligns with their goals.

I don't see any reason why they wouldn't use such tools. It's a common tactic for attackers to leverage existing, legitimate tools for their operations. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The analysis indicates that FIN13 would likely use PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after discovery, as it aligns with their tactics and the attack sequence described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
