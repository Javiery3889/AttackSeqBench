Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether attackers who have collected Instagram credentials through phishing sites would likely stop specific services related to backups before changing the passwords to lock out the original owners. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that phishing is a common method used by attackers to gather login credentials. Once they have the victims' Instagram usernames and passwords, they can log into the accounts. The next step in their attack would likely involve taking control of the account to prevent the original owner from accessing it. Changing the password is a straightforward way to do this, effectively locking the victim out.

Now, the question is about whether they would stop specific services related to backups before doing this. I'm thinking about what backup services Instagram might use. Instagram itself doesn't have a built-in backup service, but users might have their accounts linked to other services like Google Photos or Apple Photos for backing up their content. Alternatively, some users might use third-party apps or services to back up their Instagram data.

If attackers want to ensure they have full control and prevent the victim from recovering their account, they might try to disable any backup services. This could prevent the victim from restoring their account or accessing data through backups. For example, if a user has their Instagram linked to Google Photos, the attacker might try to access the Google account and disable the backup feature. Alternatively, they might delete backups or prevent new backups from being created.

Another angle is that by disabling backups, attackers can make it harder for the victim to recover their account. If the victim tries to regain access through Instagram's recovery process, having no recent backups could hinder their ability to retrieve lost data or prove ownership of the account.

I'm also considering the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which categorizes various attack techniques. Disabling backup services might fall under techniques like Account Access Removal (T1531) or Data Destruction (T1485), where attackers remove access to accounts or destroy data to prevent recovery. Changing passwords is a common tactic underCredential Access (T1550), specifically T1550.001 for OS Credential Dumping, but in this case, it's more about changing passwords to lock out the user.

So, putting it all together, after collecting credentials via phishing, attackers would likely change the password to lock the victim out. To make this more effective, they might also disable any backup services linked to the account to prevent the victim from recovering data or regaining access through backups. Therefore, the answer would be that yes, they are likely to stop backup services before changing the password.

After collecting Instagram credentials through phishing, attackers are likely to stop backup services to prevent the victim from recovering their account. This aligns with attack techniques aimed at disabling recovery methods and ensuring control over the account. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
