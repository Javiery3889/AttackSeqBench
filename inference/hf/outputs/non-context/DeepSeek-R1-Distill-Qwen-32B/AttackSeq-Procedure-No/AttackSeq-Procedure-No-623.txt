Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the CostaRicto Campaign would use tools like pscan and nmap after using PowerShell injection with Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the question is about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack. The scenario given is that the attackers have already used PowerShell injection via the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection module from PowerSploit. Now, the question is whether they would then use pscan and nmap for network scanning before deploying SombRAT for further activities.

I remember that the MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes different attack techniques. Let me think about each part of the sequence.

1. **PowerShell Injection with Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection**: This is a technique where attackers inject malicious code into a legitimate process using PowerShell. It's a common method for executing code without writing it to disk, which helps avoid detection. This falls under the "Execution" tactic in ATT&CK.

2. **Using pscan and nmap for network service scanning**: These are tools used for scanning networks to identify open ports and services. pscan is a PowerShell-based tool, and nmap is a well-known network exploration tool. Using these would be part of the "Reconnaissance" or "Resource Development" tactics, where attackers gather information about the target network.

3. **Deploying SombRAT for process, system info, and time discovery**: SombRAT is a backdoor tool that allows attackers to control the compromised system. The activities mentioned—process discovery, system information, and system time—are part of the "Discovery" tactic in ATT&CK. This is where attackers learn more about the compromised system to plan further attacks.

Now, considering the sequence: after executing code via PowerShell injection, the next logical step would be to gather information about the environment. So, using pscan and nmap makes sense because they help the attacker understand the network layout, identify other potential targets, and plan lateral movement. Once the network is mapped, deploying a backdoor like SombRAT would allow the attacker to maintain persistence and gather more detailed information about the compromised system.

I should also think about whether pscan and nmap are typically used in such campaigns. Since they are common tools, it's plausible that the attackers would use them. Moreover, the use of pscan, being a PowerShell tool, aligns with the initial use of PowerShell injection, indicating a consistent toolset.

So, putting it all together, the sequence makes sense: execute via PowerShell, scan the network, then use a backdoor for deeper discovery. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The sequence of actions described aligns with typical attack patterns. After using PowerShell injection, network scanning with pscan and nmap is a logical next step to gather information, followed by deploying SombRAT for further system discovery.
