Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware, after using HTTPS for command and control, is likely to use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to gather system information and process lists. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that HTTPS is a common method for malware to communicate with its command and control (C2) servers because it's encrypted and can bypass some network monitoring. So, the malware using HTTPS makes sense as a way to hide its communications.

Now, the question is about what happens next. The malware has already established C2 via HTTPS. The next step in many attack sequences is for the malware to gather information about the compromised system. This is often referred to as the "discovery" phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. During this phase, attackers want to know what they're dealing with—like what processes are running, what software is installed, system details, etc.—so they can decide the next steps, like lateral movement or data exfiltration.

The specific command mentioned is 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'. I'm familiar with these commands. 'tasklist' lists all running processes, which can help the attacker understand what's running on the system. 'systeminfo' provides detailed information about the system, including OS version, installed hotfixes, system uptime, etc. Both of these are basic Windows commands that are commonly used by attackers because they're simple and effective.

So, putting it together: after establishing C2, the next logical step is to gather system information. Using these commands is a straightforward way to do that. It's a common tactic because it doesn't require any additional tools, just the built-in Windows utilities. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK TTPs, specifically under the "Discovery" tactics, where techniques like System Information Discovery and Process Discovery are listed.

I don't see any reason why the malware wouldn't do this. It's a standard procedure in many attacks. So, the answer should be yes, it's likely.

The malware, after establishing HTTPS-based command and control, is likely to gather system information using the specified commands as part of the discovery phase, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks.

Final Answer: A: Yes
