Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attack described in the question is likely to have evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts. The question says that the attack started by sending a PDF attachment that passed through security filters and looked benign. Then, it used legitimate tools and scripts for its operations. The answer choices are just Yes or No.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The attack begins with a PDF attachment, which is a common method for initial access. PDFs can be weaponized to execute malicious code, but if the security filters didn't catch it, that means the PDF was crafted in a way that it didn't trigger any alerts. So, the initial step evaded detection.

Next, the attack used legitimate tools and scripts. I know that attackers often use legitimate tools because they're less likely to be detected by security systems. Tools like PowerShell, Mimikatz, or even built-in Windows utilities are common. Using these tools helps attackers blend in and avoid suspicion.

So, the sequence is: initial access via a benign-looking PDF, then using legitimate tools. This makes sense because the initial vector is stealthy, and the subsequent tools are hard to detect. Therefore, it's likely that the attack evaded detection this way.

I think the answer is Yes because both the initial vector and the tools used are designed to avoid detection. The PDF passed through filters, and the tools are legitimate, making it harder for security systems to flag the activity as malicious.

The attack likely evaded detection by using a PDF attachment that bypassed security filters and then employing legitimate tools and scripts, which are harder to detect. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
