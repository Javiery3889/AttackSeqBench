Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether campaigns that deliver payloads through malicious documents and execute them via macros would likely disable driver signing verification by tampering with Registry keys before loading a rootkit driver as part of their Defense Evasion tactics. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Initial Access often involves delivering payloads through methods like phishing emails with malicious attachments. In this case, it's malicious documents. Once the document is opened, if macros are enabled, they can execute malicious code. This execution typically happens in a new directory with a random name to avoid detection.

Now, the question is about Defense Evasion tactics. I remember that Defense Evasion involves techniques attackers use to avoid detection. One common method is tampering with system settings to prevent security tools from detecting malicious activities.

Disabling driver signing verification is a technique I've heard about. Drivers are supposed to be signed by trusted publishers, but attackers might disable this check to load their own unsigned drivers, like rootkits. Rootkits are stealthy and can hide malicious activities deep within the system.

So, the process would be: after executing the payload, the attacker might modify Registry keys to disable driver signing. This would allow them to load a rootkit driver without the system flagging it as unsigned. This makes sense because it's a way to bypass security mechanisms and maintain persistence.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on what I know, attackers often use such Registry tampering to disable security features. Therefore, it's likely that they would do this before loading a rootkit as part of their evasion tactics.

I don't see any reason why they wouldn't do this. It's a common practice to ensure their malicious drivers aren't detected. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The question involves determining if attackers disable driver signing verification via Registry tampering before loading a rootkit as part of Defense Evasion. Attackers often use such tactics to bypass security checks, allowing unsigned drivers to load undetected. This aligns with known evasion techniques, making the answer affirmative.

Final Answer: A
