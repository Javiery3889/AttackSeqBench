Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Longhorn's malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the malware communicates externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals. That makes sense because attackers often use these tactics to avoid detection by security systems that might flag large or frequent data transfers.

Now, the question is about whether the malware will set up a specific domain and IP per target for command and control (C&C) communication over HTTPS with a custom crypto protocol. I know that in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, there are several techniques related to C&C communication. For example, T1573.001 is about using HTTPS for C&C to blend in with normal traffic. Also, T1573.002 talks about using custom protocols, which could be used to avoid detection by standard network monitoring tools.

Longhorn, as a malware, likely uses these techniques to maintain persistence and control. Using a specific domain and IP per target suggests that the malware might be using domain generation algorithms (DGA) or specific hardcoded domains, which is a common tactic. This would allow each target to have a unique communication point, making it harder for defenders to block all of them at once.

The use of HTTPS would help in evading network-based detection since it's encrypted. Additionally, a custom cryptographic protocol would add another layer of obscurity, making it difficult for security tools to inspect the traffic. This combination would make the C&C communication more stealthy and resilient against takedown attempts.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the analysis, it seems plausible that Longhorn's malware would employ these techniques to enhance its stealth and persistence. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The malware in question uses techniques to avoid detection, such as scheduled exfiltration and randomized intervals. It is likely to employ specific domains and IPs for C&C communication over HTTPS with a custom protocol to enhance stealth and persistence, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK tactics. 

Final Answer: A
