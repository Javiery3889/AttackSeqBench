Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Internet Explorer zero-day exploit, as identified by FireEye Research Labs, executes certain native Windows functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP to execute shellcode that downloads the next stage payload. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand what each part of the question is asking. The exploit is a zero-day, meaning it's a previously unknown vulnerability that's being exploited. FireEye Research Labs would have analyzed this exploit, so their report would detail the techniques used.

The question mentions two specific functions: GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo. These are Windows API functions. GetFileAttributesW is used to get information about a file, like its attributes, and GetSystemInfo retrieves information about the system, such as the amount of physical memory, page size, and processor architecture.

In the context of an exploit, these functions might be used for various purposes. For example, GetFileAttributesW could be used to check if a file exists or to gather information about the target environment. GetSystemInfo could help the exploit determine the system's configuration, which is crucial for ensuring the exploit works correctly across different systems.

Next, the question talks about bypassing ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention). ASLR randomizes the memory addresses used by processes, making it harder for attackers to predict where their code will execute. DEP prevents execution of code in non-executable memory regions, which is a common technique in buffer overflow attacks.

To bypass ASLR, an exploit might use information disclosure vulnerabilities to leak memory addresses, allowing the attacker to calculate the correct addresses for their payload. For DEP, techniques like Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) or using existing executable memory regions (like those loaded by other processes) are common.

Now, considering the sequence: does the exploit execute these functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP? Typically, in an exploit, the initial stages involve gaining control of the instruction pointer (EIP or RIP) and then executing code. Before that, the exploit might need to gather information about the system to tailor the exploit correctly. So, using functions like GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo would make sense as part of the initial reconnaissance phase.

Once the exploit has control, it might use these functions to gather necessary information, then proceed to bypass ASLR and DEP. After that, it would execute shellcode, which in this case downloads the next stage payload.

So, putting it all together, the exploit likely does execute these native Windows functions before bypassing the security protections. Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The Internet Explorer zero-day exploit, as analyzed by FireEye, likely uses GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo to gather system information before bypassing ASLR and DEP to execute shellcode. This sequence aligns with typical exploit behavior, where initial reconnaissance is followed by exploitation techniques to bypass security measures.

Final Answer: A
