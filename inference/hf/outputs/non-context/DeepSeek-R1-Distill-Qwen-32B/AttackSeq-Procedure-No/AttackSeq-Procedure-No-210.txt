Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same channel. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The question mentions that after using system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, the backdoor is likely to communicate with a C2 server. The options are whether it's likely to use a non-standard port for this communication before exfiltrating data.

I know that in cybersecurity, especially with malware and backdoors, the use of non-standard ports is a common tactic. Attackers often avoid standard ports (like 80 or 443) because they're heavily monitored. Using non-standard ports can help them evade detection. So, if the Milestone backdoor is sophisticated, it might use such a tactic.

The question also mentions that after system information discovery and screen capture, the next step is communication with C2. So, the sequence is: gather info, capture screens, then communicate. It makes sense that the communication would be via a non-standard port to avoid being caught by firewalls or IDS/IPS systems.

Looking at the answer choices, A is Yes and B is No. Based on what I know, using non-standard ports is a common practice for C2 communication to avoid detection. Therefore, it's likely that Milestone would do this before exfiltrating data.

I don't see any reason why it wouldn't use a non-standard port. If it used a standard port, it might be more easily detected, which would be counterproductive for the attacker. So, the answer should be A: Yes.

The Milestone backdoor is likely to use a non-standard port for C2 communication to evade detection, as attackers often avoid standard ports. This aligns with the sequence of gathering information and capturing screens before exfiltration.

Final Answer: A
