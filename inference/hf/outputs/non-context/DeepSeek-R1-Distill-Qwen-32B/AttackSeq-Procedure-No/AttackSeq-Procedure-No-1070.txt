Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Tropic Trooper would drop RegAsm.exe after using Equation Editor exploits to execute a malicious installer. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that Equation Editor exploits are often used in phishing attacks, especially in documents like Word or Excel files. When someone opens a malicious document, the exploit can execute code, which in this case is an installer package with malicious payloads. So the initial step is the exploit delivering the payload.

Now, the question is about what happens next. The user is asking if Tropic Trooper would then drop RegAsm.exe. I remember that RegAsm.exe is a legitimate Windows tool used for registering .NET assemblies. But in the context of malware, it's sometimes used to execute malicious code because it's a trusted executable, which can help bypass some security measures.

After dropping RegAsm.exe, the next step mentioned is injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. DLLhost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts in-process server applications. Injecting a DLL into it can allow attackers to execute code within a trusted process, making it harder to detect.

I'm trying to recall if Tropic Trooper's tactics include these specific steps. From what I remember, Tropic Trooper, also known as APT32, has used various techniques, including exploit of Equation Editor vulnerabilities. They often use living off the land binaries (LOLBins) like RegAsm.exe to execute their payloads. Using RegAsm.exe makes sense because it's a legitimate tool, so it might not be flagged by antivirus or EDR solutions.

Once RegAsm.exe is dropped, it's plausible that they would use it to execute a malicious DLL. Injecting this DLL into dllhost.exe would allow them to maintain persistence and execute further malicious activities without being easily detected. This sequence aligns with common tactics used by APT groups to establish a foothold and maintain access.

So putting it all together: Equation Editor exploit leads to executing an installer, which drops RegAsm.exe. Then, RegAsm.exe is used to execute a malicious DLL, which is injected into dllhost.exe. This seems like a logical and plausible sequence of TTPs for Tropic Trooper.

The sequence described aligns with Tropic Trooper's known tactics. They use Equation Editor exploits to deliver payloads, employ RegAsm.exe as a LOLBin, and inject malicious DLLs into legitimate processes like dllhost.exe for persistence and evasion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
