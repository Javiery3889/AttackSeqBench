Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SombRAT backdoor from the CostaRicto Campaign would perform process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the MITRE ATT&CK framework is a key resource for understanding adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The question mentions the Discovery phase, which is one of the phases in the MITRE ATT&CK model. The Discovery phase typically involves an attacker gathering information about the target environment to understand the network, identify high-value targets, and plan further attacks.

The question states that SombRAT communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. Protocol tunneling is a technique where attackers encapsulate one protocol within another to bypass network restrictions. This is often used to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel, which is a common technique in the Command and Control phase of an attack.

Now, the question is about whether, after establishing this C2 channel, the backdoor would perform process discovery and system information discovery. Process discovery involves identifying running processes on a system, which can help attackers understand what's running and potentially identify security software. System information discovery involves gathering details about the system, such as OS version, installed software, hardware, etc.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, these two techniques fall under the Discovery phase. Typically, after establishing a C2 channel, attackers move into the Discovery phase to gather as much information as possible about the compromised system and the broader network. This information helps them decide the next steps, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.

So, considering that SombRAT is a backdoor, its primary function is to maintain persistence and communicate with the C2 server. However, backdoors often have additional functionalities, including information gathering. It's common for such malware to perform process and system information discovery to assess the environment and plan subsequent actions.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the typical behavior of backdoors and the structure of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it's highly likely that after establishing the C2 channel, the next step would involve discovery activities to understand the target better.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

The SombRAT backdoor, after establishing a C2 channel via protocol tunneling, would likely proceed to gather information about the system and processes, which aligns with the Discovery phase in MITRE ATT&CK. This step is crucial for attackers to plan further actions.

Final Answer: A
