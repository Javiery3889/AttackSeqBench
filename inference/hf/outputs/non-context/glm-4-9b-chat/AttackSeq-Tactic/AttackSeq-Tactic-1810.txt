Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where attackers are collecting credentials and preparing them for transmission every hour.
- The sequence also mentions that the attackers established a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: Resource Development - This tactic involves gathering intelligence on potential targets and resources. It does not directly relate to the action of collecting and transmitting credentials.
- B: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment. The description of collecting credentials and preparing them for transmission fits this category.
- C: Reconnaissance - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment to identify potential vulnerabilities. While reconnaissance may have occurred before the collection of credentials, it does not specifically address the action of transmitting the credentials.
- D: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication channels with compromised systems to issue commands and receive data. The action of uploading credentials to an external FTP server is a form of command and control, but it is a subsequent action after the collection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves the attackers first collecting credentials and then preparing them for transmission. This aligns with the TTP of Collection.
- The subsequent action of uploading the credentials to an external FTP server is part of the overall process of command and control, but it is not the primary TTP described in the question.
- Therefore, the most plausible TTP that occurred when the attackers established a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials is Collection.

Final Answer: B: Collection
