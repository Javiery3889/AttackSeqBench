1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already surveyed the victim's computer and sent information to a remote server.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: 
     1. Surveying the victim's computer
     2. Sending information to a remote server
     3. Using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Discovery - This TTP is typically used to gather information about the target environment. The question states that the attacker has already completed this step by surveying the victim's computer and sending information to a remote server.
   - B: Impact - This TTP is used to cause harm or disruption to the target system. There is no indication in the question that the attacker is attempting to impact the system at this point.
   - C: Command and Control (C2) - This TTP involves establishing communication with the compromised system to issue commands or exfiltrate data. The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is indicative of a C2 channel being established.
   - D: Exfiltration - This TTP is used to steal data from the compromised system. While the information was sent to a remote server, the question does not specify that the attacker is currently exfiltrating data.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attacker has already completed the Discovery phase by surveying the victim's computer and sending information to a remote server.
   - The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 is a method commonly used for establishing a Command and Control channel.
   - There is no indication that the attacker is currently impacting the system or exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
