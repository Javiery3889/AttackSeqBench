1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving an attacker named "Dropping Elephant" who gained initial access to high-profile targets through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The context is that these targets are diplomatic and economic entities, and the attacker's focus is on gathering information.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Initial Access, spear-phishing, watering hole attacks, and the focus is on gathering information.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Initial Access - This is the first step in the sequence described in the question, but it does not specifically address the focus on gathering information.
   - B: Impact - This TTP is about causing harm or disruption, which is not the primary focus of the question.
   - C: Discovery - This TTP involves enumerating and mapping the environment to understand the target's infrastructure, which could be a step before gathering information but is not the primary focus of the initial access phase.
   - D: Reconnaissance - This TTP involves gathering information about the target to understand its environment, which aligns with the focus on gathering information and is a common step before attempting to gain initial access.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with gaining initial access, which is a broad term that encompasses various methods. Spear-phishing and watering hole attacks are methods of initial access, but the focus is on the information gathering aspect.
   - The attacker's focus on gathering information suggests that they would have conducted reconnaissance to understand the target's environment and gather intelligence before attempting to gain access.
   - Therefore, the TTP that most likely occurred before gaining initial access, given the focus on gathering information, is Reconnaissance.

Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
