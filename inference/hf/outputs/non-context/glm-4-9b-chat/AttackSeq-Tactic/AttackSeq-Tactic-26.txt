Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that include social engineering, opening malicious .src files, and then using mechanisms such as shortcuts or fake binaries for persistence.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Social engineering
  2. Opening malicious .src files
  3. Leveraging mechanisms for persistence

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network after initial access. It does not directly relate to executing arbitrary code or opening files.
- Answer Choice B: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial exploitation of a vulnerability to gain access to a target system. While opening a malicious file could be part of initial access, it does not specifically refer to executing arbitrary code.
- Answer Choice C: Execution - This tactic involves executing arbitrary code on a target system. Opening a malicious file is a common method to execute code, which aligns with the sequence described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation - This tactic involves increasing the attacker's level of access on a system. It does not directly relate to executing arbitrary code or opening files.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question starts with social engineering, which is a method to gain initial access. The next step is the execution of arbitrary code by opening a malicious file. This aligns with the TTP of Execution.
- The subsequent step involves persistence mechanisms, which are not directly related to executing arbitrary code but rather to maintaining access on the system.
- Therefore, the most plausible TTP that occurred to execute arbitrary code on the infected hosts is Execution.

Final Answer: C: Execution
