1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a backdoor that encrypts C&C (Command and Control) traffic, communicates with a C&C server via Tor, and then mentions that stolen data was sent to the C&C server.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Encrypting C&C traffic
     - Communicating with C&C via Tor
     - Sending stolen data to the C&C server

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Command and Control - This TTP is related to the initial communication with the C&C server, but it does not directly involve the sending of stolen data.
   - Answer Choice B: Discovery - This TTP is about identifying and collecting information about the target environment, which is not directly related to the described sequence.
   - Answer Choice C: Exfiltration - This TTP involves the unauthorized transfer of data from the target system to an external location, which aligns with the description of stolen data being sent to the C&C server.
   - Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance - This TTP is about gathering information about the target environment, which is not directly related to the described sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question involves the backdoor encrypting and communicating with the C&C server, which are part of the Command and Control phase. However, the next step is the actual sending of stolen data to the C&C server.
   - The TTP that best fits the action of sending stolen data is Exfiltration, as it involves the unauthorized transfer of data from the compromised system to an external location.
   - Therefore, the most plausible TTP that occurred next in the attack sequence is Exfiltration.

Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
