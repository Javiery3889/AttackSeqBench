Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have already used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Lateral Movement.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion - This tactic is often used to avoid detection and mitigation efforts. While it could be a plausible step after lateral movement, it is not the immediate next step in the sequence.
- Answer Choice B: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with the attacker's command and control (C2) server. It is a common next step after lateral movement, as the attacker would need to maintain control over the compromised systems.
- Answer Choice C: Impact - This tactic refers to actions that cause harm to the target, such as data exfiltration or system disruption. While it could occur after lateral movement, it is not the immediate next step in the sequence.
- Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement - This is the tactic that has already occurred, as stated in the question.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question has already included Lateral Movement, so we are looking for the next most plausible TTP.
- Defense Evasion and Impact are not the immediate next steps in the sequence, as they do not follow directly after lateral movement.
- Command and Control is the most plausible next step, as it is a common TTP that follows lateral movement, allowing the attacker to maintain control over the compromised systems.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control
