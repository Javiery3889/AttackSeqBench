1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of events following a spear-phishing attack that exploited the Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to deliver a secondary payload.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: spear-phishing, Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119), delivery of secondary payload, and execution of ActionScript classes.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Resource Development - This tactic involves the collection and organization of resources required for an attack. It typically occurs before the initial exploitation phase but after the initial reconnaissance.
   - Answer Choice B: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information about the target. It is usually the first step in the attack lifecycle and occurs before the initial access.
   - Answer Choice C: Execution - This tactic involves the execution of the attack, such as running a payload or script. It is the step where the secondary payload is installed and ActionScript classes are executed.
   - Answer Choice D: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial entry into the target environment, which in this case is the spear-phishing attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events starts with a spear-phishing attack, which is a form of Initial Access (Answer Choice D).
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker exploited the Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119), which is a part of the Execution tactic (Answer Choice C).
   - The delivery of the secondary payload is also part of the Execution tactic (Answer Choice C).
   - The execution of the ActionScript classes to install the payload is also part of the Execution tactic (Answer Choice C).
   - The Collection (Answer Choice B) and Resource Development (Answer Choice A) tactics would have occurred before the initial spear-phishing attack.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible TTP that occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes is the Initial Access, as it is the first step that leads to the exploitation of the Adobe Flash vulnerability.

Final Answer: D: Initial Access
