Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where attackers gather information about the victim's computer and then proceed to use a backdoor to send exfiltrated data over a Command and Control (C&C) channel.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. Gathering information about the victim's computer.
  2. Using a backdoor to send exfiltrated data over a C&C channel.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Command and Control - This is the final action described in the question, which is sending exfiltrated data over a C&C channel. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before this, so this is not the correct answer.
- Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance - This tactic involves gathering intelligence about the target environment. The question explicitly states that the attackers gathered information about the victim's computer, which aligns with the Reconnaissance phase.
- Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network after initial access. The question does not mention any movement within the network, so this is not the correct answer.
- Answer Choice D: Collection - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While the attackers are gathering information, the question also mentions the use of a backdoor, which is more indicative of the Collection phase in the context of exfiltrating data.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question starts with gathering information about the victim's computer, which is a clear indication of the Reconnaissance phase.
- The other answer choices do not align with the sequence of events as described in the question.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is Reconnaissance.

Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
