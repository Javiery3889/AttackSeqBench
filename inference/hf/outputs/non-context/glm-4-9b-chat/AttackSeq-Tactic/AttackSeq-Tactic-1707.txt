Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events following the successful delivery of a phishing email with a PowerPoint add-in document containing a VBA macro.
- The sequence ends before the malware uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Phishing email delivery
  2. PowerPoint add-in document with VBA macro
  3. Execution of the VBA macro
  4. Use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Initial Access - This tactic refers to the initial steps an attacker takes to gain access to a target's network or system. It typically includes the delivery of the phishing email, but it does not cover the execution of the VBA macro or the use of 'mshta.exe'.
- Answer Choice B: Execution - This tactic involves the execution of the malicious code or payload. The VBA macro's execution fits into this category, but it does not encompass the entire sequence described in the question.
- Answer Choice C: Discovery - This tactic refers to the attacker's actions to identify and gather information about the target environment. It does not align with the described sequence, as the sequence involves the execution of the malicious code rather than information gathering.
- Answer Choice D: Resource Development - This tactic involves the attacker's actions to develop resources needed for the attack, such as creating or obtaining tools, payloads, or other resources. The use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL fits into this category, as it is a tool used to deliver the payload.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question starts with the delivery of a phishing email, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.
- The next step is the execution of the VBA macro, which is part of the Execution tactic.
- The final step before the use of 'mshta.exe' is the development of resources, which is part of the Resource Development tactic.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper, which falls under the Resource Development tactic.

Final Answer: D: Resource Development
