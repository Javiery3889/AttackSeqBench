Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server and modified the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: gaining access to the CDN server and conducting a strategic web compromise.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: Command and Control - This tactic typically involves establishing communication channels with the compromised system to issue commands or exfiltrate data. It is usually a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
- B: Defense Evasion - This tactic is used to bypass security controls and avoid detection. It could be used after gaining access to avoid being detected, but it is not specific to the action of modifying a file.
- C: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial exploitation of a vulnerability to gain access to a system. Since the attackers have already gained access, this is not the next likely tactic.
- D: Resource Development - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment to understand the attack surface and potential points of exploitation. Modifying a file on a CDN server could be seen as part of resource development to create a malicious payload or to understand the CDN's infrastructure.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already gained access to the CDN server, so the next logical step would be to utilize that access for further malicious activities.
- Command and Control is a later stage and not directly related to the action of modifying a file.
- Defense Evasion is a general tactic that could be used at any stage but is not specific to the action of modifying a file.
- Initial Access is not the next step after gaining access.
- Resource Development is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after gaining access, as the attackers would likely use the access to gather more information or prepare for further actions.

Final Answer: D: Resource Development
