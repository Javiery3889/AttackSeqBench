1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker, referred to as Whitefly, has used stolen credentials for lateral movement across the network to expand their control.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: stolen credentials, lateral movement.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Resource Development - This tactic involves gathering intelligence about the target environment, which could be a precursor to lateral movement but is not directly related to the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion - This tactic is about evading detection and mitigation efforts, which could be a part of the overall attack but is not specifically related to the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement - This is the TTP mentioned in the question as the action that occurred after using stolen credentials. It is a direct continuation of the described sequence.
   - Answer Choice D: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment, which could be a goal after lateral movement but is not the immediate action following the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question specifically mentions that Whitefly used stolen credentials for lateral movement, which is a TTP associated with the Lateral Movement tactic.
   - The other answer choices (Resource Development, Defense Evasion, and Collection) are not directly related to the immediate action of using stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs following the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
