1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving APT3 and APT18 using phishing campaigns to exploit a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to deliver payloads (SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT) and establish communication with hardcoded CnC (Command and Control) addresses.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Phishing campaigns
     2. Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability
     3. Delivering payloads (SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT)
     4. Establishing communication with hardcoded CnC addresses

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Command and Control - This is the final step in the sequence where the payloads establish communication with hardcoded CnC addresses. However, it is not the tactic that occurred immediately after the delivery of payloads.
   - B: Defense Evasion - This tactic could be involved in the sequence, as attackers might use various techniques to avoid detection, but it is not the immediate step after delivering payloads.
   - C: Initial Access - This is the step where the attackers gain initial access to the target system, which would include the phishing campaign and the exploitation of the zero-day vulnerability. This is the first step in the sequence.
   - D: Impact - This tactic is about the effects of the attack, such as data exfiltration or system modification, which would come after establishing communication with CnC. It is not the immediate step after delivering payloads.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question starts with Initial Access (C), where the attackers use phishing campaigns and a zero-day vulnerability to gain access to the target system.
   - After gaining access, they deliver payloads (SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT), which is not a separate TTP but rather a part of the Initial Access phase.
   - The next logical step would be to establish communication with hardcoded CnC addresses, which is related to the Command and Control (A) tactic.
   - Defense Evasion (B) could be part of the process but is not the immediate step after delivering payloads.
   - Impact (D) is the result of the attack and not a tactic in the sequence.

Final Answer: C: Initial Access
