Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving reconnaissance, spear phishing, and credential harvesting.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: reconnaissance, spear phishing, and credential harvesting.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Discovery - This TTP involves identifying and understanding the environment, which could be part of reconnaissance but is not specific to the initial access phase.
- Answer Choice B: Collection - This TTP involves gathering information about the target environment, which is also part of reconnaissance but not specific to the initial access phase.
- Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance - This TTP is the act of gathering information about the target before any other actions are taken. It is the first step in the sequence described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: Resource Development - This TTP involves developing tools, infrastructure, and other resources to support the attack. It is not directly related to the initial access phase.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with reconnaissance, which is the process of gathering information about the target.
- Spear phishing and credential harvesting are techniques used to gain initial access to the target environment, which would follow reconnaissance.
- Therefore, the TTP that most likely occurred before APT42 gained initial access through spear phishing and credential harvesting techniques is reconnaissance.

Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
