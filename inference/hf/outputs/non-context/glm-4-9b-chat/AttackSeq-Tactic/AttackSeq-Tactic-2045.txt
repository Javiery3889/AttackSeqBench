Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where Iron Tiger has gained access to the Mimi chat developer's backend and compromised its servers through a supply chain attack.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: gaining access, compromising servers, and the attack vector being a supply chain attack.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Resource Development - This tactic involves gathering intelligence and resources to support the attack. It could be a plausible step after gaining access and compromising servers, as Iron Tiger might be looking for additional information or tools.
- Answer Choice B: Exfiltration - This tactic involves extracting data from the target environment. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not necessarily the immediate step after gaining access and compromising servers, especially if the goal is to gather resources or establish a persistent presence.
- Answer Choice C: Initial Access - This tactic is about the initial entry into the target environment. Since the question states that Iron Tiger has already gained access, this cannot be the correct answer.
- Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion - This tactic is about evading detection by security systems. While it is a likely step in a sophisticated attack, it is not the immediate step after gaining access and compromising servers. It is more likely to occur after the initial access and resource development.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question suggests that Iron Tiger has already achieved Initial Access and is now looking to expand its presence within the target environment.
- Resource Development is the most plausible step after gaining access and compromising servers, as it aligns with the idea that Iron Tiger would be looking to gather more information or tools to further their objectives.
- Exfiltration and Defense Evasion are important steps in an attack, but they are not the immediate steps following the initial access and compromise of servers.

Final Answer: A: Resource Development
