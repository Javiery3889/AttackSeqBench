Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers initially infected servers and then used them as a pivot to spread manually across the network using an Explosive Trojan.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: 
  1. Initial infection of servers
  2. Use of infected servers as a pivot
  3. Manual spread across the network using an Explosive Trojan

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Initial Access - This TTP refers to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability to gain access to the target network or system. It does not describe the subsequent actions of pivoting and spreading manually.
- Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement - This TTP involves moving laterally within the network to spread from one system to another. The description of using infected servers as a pivot and manually spreading across the network aligns with this TTP.
- Answer Choice C: Command and Control - This TTP refers to the establishment of communication between the attacker and the compromised systems. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of using servers as a pivot and spreading manually.
- Answer Choice D: Execution - This TTP refers to the delivery of the initial payload or exploit. While it is a part of the initial infection, it does not cover the subsequent actions of pivoting and spreading manually.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves an initial infection, followed by the use of that infection to spread to other systems, which is a clear indication of lateral movement.
- Initial Access (A) is not the correct answer because it does not describe the subsequent actions of pivoting and spreading.
- Command and Control (C) is not the correct answer because it does not describe the spreading actions.
- Execution (D) is not the correct answer because it is part of the initial infection, not the subsequent spreading actions.

Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
