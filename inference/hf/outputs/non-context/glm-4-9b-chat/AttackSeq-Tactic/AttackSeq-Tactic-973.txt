Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where CosmicDuke is searching for files on both hard drives and network drives.
- The search is for files that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Searching for files with specific patterns.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network after initial access. It does not directly involve searching for files.
- B: Discovery - This tactic involves enumerating and mapping the environment to understand the network and its assets. Searching for files with specific patterns is a part of discovery as it is about understanding the environment by identifying files.
- C: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with a command and control server. It does not involve searching for files.
- D: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the environment, which could include searching for files, but it is more about gathering data rather than understanding the environment.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The action described in the question is about understanding the environment by identifying files that match specific patterns, which is a part of the Discovery tactic.
- Lateral Movement and Command and Control are not directly related to the action of searching for files.
- Collection could be related, but it is more about gathering data rather than understanding the environment through discovery.

Final Answer: B: Discovery
