Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events involving the distribution of malicious LNK files through spear-phishing emails, followed by the LNK file initiating a multi-stage attack.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. Higaisa distributed malicious LNK files.
  2. Spear-phishing via RAR archives.
  3. LNK file copying its content to a temporary directory.
  4. Using 'certutil.exe' to decode a base64 blob.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial exploitation of a vulnerability to gain a beachhead on the target network. While the distribution of the LNK files is a part of the initial access, it does not cover the entire sequence described.
- Answer Choice B: Execution - This tactic involves executing the malicious payload on the target system. The copying of the LNK file's content to a temporary directory and using 'certutil.exe' to decode a base64 blob are part of the execution phase. However, the initial distribution of the LNK files is not explicitly mentioned here.
- Answer Choice C: Resource Development - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment and resources. The sequence described does not involve gathering information or developing resources, so this is not the correct choice.
- Answer Choice D: Credential Access - This tactic involves accessing or stealing credentials from the target system. The sequence described does not involve credential access, so this is not the correct choice.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question starts with the initial distribution of the malicious LNK files, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.
- The subsequent actions of copying the LNK file's content to a temporary directory and using 'certutil.exe' to decode a base64 blob are part of the Execution tactic.
- Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the distribution of the LNK files and before the multi-stage attack, the correct answer should be the one that encompasses the initial access phase.

Final Answer: A: Initial Access
