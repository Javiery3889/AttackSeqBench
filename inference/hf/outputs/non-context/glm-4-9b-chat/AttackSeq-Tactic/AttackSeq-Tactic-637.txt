1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where GreyEnergy achieved initial access through spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely informed their strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are: spearphishing, compromised public-facing web servers, and strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication channels for the attacker to control compromised systems. It is not directly related to the strategic targeting of ICS workstations.
   - B: Resource Development - This tactic involves gathering resources to support the attack. While it is a part of the overall attack lifecycle, it does not specifically address the strategic targeting of ICS workstations.
   - C: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It is a precursor to strategic targeting and would be used to understand the ICS environment before attempting to target it.
   - D: Reconnaissance - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment to inform the attack strategy. It is a direct precursor to strategic targeting and would be used to understand the ICS environment before attempting to target it.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question suggests that GreyEnergy first gained access through spearphishing and web server compromise, which are both forms of initial access. After gaining access, they would need to understand the environment they are operating within to strategically target ICS control workstations.
   - The most logical step before strategic targeting would be to gather information about the target environment, which is what Reconnaissance (D) is for.
   - Command and Control (A) and Resource Development (B) are more about maintaining the attack rather than the initial strategic planning.
   - Collection (C) is a part of Reconnaissance but is a more general term that can include Reconnaissance activities.

Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
