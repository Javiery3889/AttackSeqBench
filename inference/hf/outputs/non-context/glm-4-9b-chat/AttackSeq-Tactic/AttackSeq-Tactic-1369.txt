1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where FIN13 has exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold in victim networks.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the exploitation of external servers, deployment of web shells, and deployment of custom malware.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Persistence - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system or network. While deploying web shells and malware could be seen as a form of persistence, it is not the immediate action following the deployment of the malware.
   - B: Execution - This tactic involves executing code on a system. The deployment of web shells and custom malware would fall under this category as it involves the execution of code on the victim's systems.
   - C: Discovery - This tactic involves identifying and enumerating systems and assets within a network. This is typically done before deploying malware, not after.
   - D: Credential Access - This tactic involves accessing credentials to move laterally within a network. This is also typically done after establishing a foothold, but it is not the immediate action following the deployment of malware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question involves deploying malware, which is an action that falls under the "Execution" tactic. The deployment of malware is the immediate action after exploiting external servers.
   - The "Persistence" tactic is more about maintaining access, which would come after establishing a foothold but is not the immediate action following the deployment of malware.
   - "Discovery" is about identifying systems and assets, which would precede the deployment of malware, not follow it.
   - "Credential Access" is about accessing credentials, which is a step that could occur after establishing a foothold but is not the immediate action following the deployment of malware.

Final Answer: B: Execution
