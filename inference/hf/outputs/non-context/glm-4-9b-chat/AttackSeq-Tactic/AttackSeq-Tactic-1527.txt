Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and asks which tactic most likely occurred after "RIG EK redirects users through malvertising or compromised websites to execute exploits" and before "employing proxy servers and antivirus testing to avoid detection."
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. RIG EK redirects users through malvertising or compromised websites to execute exploits
  2. Employing proxy servers and antivirus testing to avoid detection

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation - This tactic involves attackers gaining higher levels of access within a system. It does not directly relate to the sequence described in the question.
- Answer Choice B: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial exploitation of a vulnerability to gain access to a system. While it could be part of the sequence, it does not specifically address the use of RIG EK or proxy servers.
- Answer Choice C: Execution - This tactic involves executing code on a system, which is described in the question as the action taken by RIG EK. However, it does not cover the subsequent actions of using proxy servers and antivirus testing.
- Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network after initial access has been gained. It includes actions such as evading detection, which aligns with the use of proxy servers and antivirus testing mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question starts with the execution of an exploit (RIG EK), which is a part of the Execution tactic.
- The next step in the sequence is the use of proxy servers and antivirus testing to avoid detection, which is a part of the Lateral Movement tactic.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Execution followed by Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
