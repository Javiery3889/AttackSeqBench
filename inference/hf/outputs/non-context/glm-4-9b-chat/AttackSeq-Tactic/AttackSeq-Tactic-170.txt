1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where a batch file has been executed, which installed the main payload.
   - The subsequent TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) involved is one where the malware gains elevated privileges by bypassing User Access Control (UAC).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Discovery - This TTP is typically about gathering information about the environment, which would not be the immediate action after installing a payload.
   - B: Execution - This TTP refers to the initial delivery of the payload, which has already occurred as per the question.
   - C: Resource Development - This TTP involves the attacker setting up the environment for the attack, which is not directly related to gaining elevated privileges.
   - D: Privilege Escalation - This TTP is about the attacker gaining higher levels of system access, which is the action described in the question after the payload has been installed.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question specifies that the batch file has already executed the main payload, so we are looking for the TTP that comes after this action.
   - The action described is gaining elevated privileges by bypassing UAC, which is a clear indication of an attempt to increase the attacker's access level on the system.
   - Based on the context provided, the most plausible TTP that occurred after executing the batch file and installing the main payload is Privilege Escalation.

Final Answer: D: Privilege Escalation
