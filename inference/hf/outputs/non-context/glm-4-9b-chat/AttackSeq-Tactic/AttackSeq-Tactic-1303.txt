1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the OceanLotus Group using a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook for command execution and data exfiltration, utilizing HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Use of a novel backdoor in Microsoft Outlook
     - Command execution
     - Data exfiltration
     - Utilization of HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Command and Control - This is the method used by the OceanLotus Group for their C2 (command-and-control) activities, which is a part of the exfiltration process, not a separate tactic.
   - Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. It is typically the first step in an attack, but the question describes actions that have already occurred, so this is not the correct sequence.
   - Answer Choice C: Exfiltration - This is the process of stealing data from the target environment, which is described in the question as part of the attack sequence. However, it is not a tactic but rather an action that occurs during the attack.
   - Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by security systems. Given that the OceanLotus Group is using HTTP and DNS Tunneling, which are methods to bypass security measures, this is the most plausible tactic that occurred after the described actions.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The OceanLotus Group has already executed a backdoor and is using HTTP and DNS Tunneling for command-and-control, which indicates that they have successfully evaded defenses.
   - The sequence of actions described does not include reconnaissance, as that would be the initial step.
   - Command and Control is a method used during the exfiltration process, not a separate tactic.
   - Exfiltration is an action, not a tactic.
   - Defense Evasion is the most plausible tactic that aligns with the described actions, as it involves techniques to avoid detection, which is likely a subsequent step after the backdoor is in place and data exfiltration is ongoing.

Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
