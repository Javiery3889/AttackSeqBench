1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question involves the following actions:
     - Encryption of network communications
     - Blending with normal SSL traffic

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Discovery - This tactic involves the initial gathering of information about the target environment. It does not directly relate to the encryption and blending of traffic.
   - B: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with the compromised system. While encryption and blending traffic could be part of this, it is not the primary action described in the question.
   - C: Defense Evasion - This tactic is about evading detection and analysis by security systems. Encrypting communications and blending them with normal traffic are both actions that can be part of defense evasion to avoid detection.
   - D: Persistence - This tactic involves maintaining access to a compromised system over time. While encryption and blending traffic could be part of maintaining persistence, it is not the primary action described in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The primary action described in the question is the encryption of network communications and blending them with normal SSL traffic, which is a method to evade detection by security systems.
   - This aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic, as it involves techniques that are used to avoid detection and analysis.
   - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the primary actions described in the question.

Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
