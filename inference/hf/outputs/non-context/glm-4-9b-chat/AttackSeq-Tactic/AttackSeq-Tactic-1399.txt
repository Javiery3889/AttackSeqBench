Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events starting with TA413, which is a known phishing attack vector.
- The sequence continues with the delivery of a fake 'Adobe Flash Player Update' landing page.
- The landing page is used to profile the user's system.
- The final step mentioned is the determination of the delivery of the FriarFox browser extension.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Initial Access - This tactic refers to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability to gain access to the target system. While the phishing email is a method of initial access, the question is asking about the tactic that follows the delivery of the fake update and profiling of the system.
- Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection by security solutions. It is not directly related to the profiling of the system or the delivery of the browser extension.
- Answer Choice C: Discovery - This tactic involves enumerating the environment to understand the assets and map the network. The profiling of the user's system and the determination of the browser extension delivery fit within the scope of discovery, as the attacker is learning about the target environment.
- Answer Choice D: Credential Access - This tactic involves techniques used to obtain credentials. While credentials might be a goal of the attack, the question does not specify that credentials were accessed, only that the system was profiled and the browser extension was delivered.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The phishing email is a method of Initial Access (TA1005), but the question asks about the subsequent tactic.
- The delivery of the fake update and profiling of the system is not directly related to Defense Evasion (TA0008).
- The profiling of the system and the determination of the browser extension delivery are part of the Discovery (TA1018) tactic, as the attacker is learning about the target environment.
- Credential Access (TA1019) is not specified in the question, so it cannot be concluded as the next step.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
