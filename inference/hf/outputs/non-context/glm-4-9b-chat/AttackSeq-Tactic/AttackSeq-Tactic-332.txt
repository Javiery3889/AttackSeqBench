Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Bankshot implant has evaded detection and persisted on the victim's network.
- The key event mentioned is the implants communicating with hardcoded control servers while disguised as ZIP files.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to access other systems. While the implant may perform lateral movement after establishing a presence, the question specifically mentions communication with control servers, which is more related to command and control.
- B: Discovery - This tactic involves enumerating and mapping the network to understand its structure. The question does not mention any discovery activities, but rather the communication with control servers.
- C: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves evading detection mechanisms. While the implant evaded detection initially, the question focuses on the communication aspect, which is not directly related to defense evasion.
- D: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with a command and control server to receive instructions or exfiltrate data. The question explicitly states that the implants communicated with hardcoded control servers, which is a clear indication of command and control activity.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the implant communicating with hardcoded control servers, which is a direct action related to the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
- The other answer choices do not align as closely with the specific action of communicating with control servers.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
