1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the acquisition of credentials using tools like Mimikatz and the ZeroLogon exploit.
   - The subsequent action mentioned is the scanning of the compromised network environment with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Credential Access (acquiring credentials)
     - Scanning the compromised network environment

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network after initial access. While scanning the network is a step that could be part of lateral movement, it is not the primary action described in the question.
   - Answer Choice B: Discovery - This tactic involves the process of identifying and mapping the network environment. Scanning the network with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan is a clear example of discovery, as it involves identifying services and potential entry points within the network.
   - Answer Choice C: Credential Access - This tactic is already described in the question as the initial action of acquiring credentials, not the subsequent action of scanning the network.
   - Answer Choice D: Resource Development - This tactic involves the collection of information about the target environment to support future operations. Scanning the network could be seen as a part of resource development, but it is more directly aligned with the Discovery tactic.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial TTP described is Credential Access, which is the acquisition of credentials.
   - The subsequent TTP described is scanning the network environment, which is a clear example of Discovery.
   - Lateral Movement and Resource Development are not the primary focus of the described actions.

Final Answer: B: Discovery
