Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have maintained persistent access to the compromised bank systems.
- The specific TTP mentioned is the configuration of remote access to servers, including making firewall configuration changes.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: Impact - This tactic involves actions that cause harm to the target environment, such as data destruction or system disruption. It does not directly relate to maintaining persistent access or configuring remote access.
- B: Credential Access - This tactic involves actions to obtain or use credentials to access systems. While it is a critical step in establishing persistence, it does not specifically address the configuration of remote access or firewall changes.
- C: Exfiltration - This tactic involves the unauthorized transfer of data from the target environment. It is not directly related to the initial establishment of persistent access or configuring remote access.
- D: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves actions to avoid detection by security tools and controls. Configuring remote access and making firewall changes to maintain persistence would fall under this category, as it is about evading defenses to keep access to the system.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves the attackers already having access to the systems and then taking actions to maintain that access.
- The specific action of configuring remote access and making firewall changes is an attempt to evade detection and maintain persistence, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The other answer choices do not directly relate to the described actions of maintaining persistent access through remote access and firewall configuration changes.

Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
