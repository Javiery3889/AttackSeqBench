1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that have already occurred: gathering network information through ADFind and port scanning.
   - The next step mentioned is the propagation of beacons to other systems within the company's network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Discovery - This tactic involves the collection of information about the network, which has already been done through ADFind and port scanning. Therefore, this is not the next step.
   - B: Execution - This tactic typically involves the delivery of the initial payload or the execution of the initial malicious code. Since the attackers are now propagating beacons, this is not the next step in the sequence.
   - C: Defense Evasion - This tactic is used to avoid detection and mitigation by security systems. Propagating beacons could be seen as a method to avoid detection, but it is more directly related to the next step in the sequence.
   - D: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to access other systems. Propagating beacons to other systems is a clear example of lateral movement, as it is the act of spreading to new systems within the network.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial steps of gathering network information through ADFind and port scanning are part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The next step, which is the propagation of beacons, is most closely aligned with the Lateral Movement tactic, as it involves moving to new systems within the network.
   - While Defense Evasion is a relevant tactic, it is not the most direct next step in the sequence after propagating beacons.

Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
