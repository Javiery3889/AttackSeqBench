Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- The sequence of events is as follows:
  1. Kingslayer gained access through the supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software.
  2. Kingslayer configured a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection.
- We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two events.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the given sequence of events:

A: Credential Access
- Credential Access is a tactic that involves obtaining credentials to access systems or data. This could be a plausible step after gaining initial access but before evading detection, as Kingslayer might need credentials to move laterally within the network.

B: Collection
- Collection is the act of gathering information from a system. This could also be a plausible step after gaining initial access, as Kingslayer would likely gather information before evading detection.

C: Initial Access
- Initial Access is the first step in the attack chain, where the attacker gains access to the target environment. The question states that Kingslayer already gained access through the supply-chain compromise, so this cannot be the tactic that occurred between the two events.

D: Defense Evasion
- Defense Evasion is a tactic used to bypass or disable security controls. The question states that Kingslayer configured a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection, which is a specific technique under Defense Evasion. Therefore, this cannot be the tactic that occurred before evading detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events suggests that Kingslayer first gained initial access, then performed some actions (which we need to identify), and finally evaded detection.
- The most plausible actions that Kingslayer would take after gaining initial access but before evading detection would be to either access credentials or collect information.
- Between Credential Access and Collection, both are plausible steps, but Credential Access is more likely to be the immediate next step after gaining access, as it would allow Kingslayer to move laterally within the network with the necessary permissions.

Final Answer: A: Credential Access
