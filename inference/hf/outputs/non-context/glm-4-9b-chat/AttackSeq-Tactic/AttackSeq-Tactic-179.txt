Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gained initial access through malicious installers or phishing campaigns.
- The attacker is looking to ensure malicious operations continue across system reboots.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Initial Access, followed by an action that ensures persistence.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: Initial Access - This is the first step mentioned in the question, but the question is asking for the next step that ensures persistence.
- B: Execution - This is the step where the malicious installer or phishing campaign is executed, which is before the initial access. It doesn't address the persistence across reboots.
- C: Persistence - This is the step that would ensure that the malicious operations continue after a system reboot. This is the most plausible TTP after gaining initial access.
- D: Lateral Movement - This TTP is about moving within the network after initial access, which is not directly related to ensuring persistence across reboots.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access has already occurred, so we are looking for the next step in the sequence.
- The action that ensures persistence across system reboots is crucial for the attacker to maintain a presence on the compromised system.
- The TTP that aligns with this requirement is Persistence.

Final Answer: C: Persistence
