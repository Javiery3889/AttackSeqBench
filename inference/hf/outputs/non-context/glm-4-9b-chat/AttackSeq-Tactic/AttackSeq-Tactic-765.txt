Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the Darkhotel APT, which gained initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
- The sequence asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: Resource Development - This tactic typically involves gathering information about potential targets, but it does not specifically address obtaining personal information like names and places of stay.
- B: Reconnaissance - This tactic involves gathering intelligence about the target environment, which could include information about the victims' whereabouts. This is a plausible answer because the attackers would need to know where their targets are to deploy the malware effectively.
- C: Initial Access - This tactic is about gaining the first point of presence on a target system, which is not directly related to obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
- D: Command and Control - This tactic is about establishing communication with the compromised system, which is also not directly related to obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers would need to know the victims' whereabouts to tailor their attack, such as by deploying malware that appears as a legitimate software update for a specific hotel.
- Resource Development is not the best fit because it does not specifically address the gathering of personal information.
- Initial Access and Command and Control are not the correct answers because they are about gaining access and establishing communication, not about gathering intelligence on the victims.
- Reconnaissance is the most plausible answer because it involves gathering intelligence, which could include the personal information needed to tailor the attack.

Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
