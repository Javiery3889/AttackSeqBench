Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where Tropic Trooper has exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
- The attack sequence includes executing commands and installing an MSI package on the system.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Exploitation of a vulnerability, Execution of commands, Installation of an MSI package.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Initial Access - This TTP is typically the first step in an attack, where an attacker gains initial entry into the target network or system. Since the question describes actions that have already occurred after exploitation, this is not the correct sequence.
- Answer Choice B: Execution - This TTP refers to the execution of a payload or command on the target system. The question explicitly mentions that commands are executed, which aligns with this TTP.
- Answer Choice C: Credential Access - This TTP involves an attacker gaining access to credentials. The question does not mention anything about credentials being accessed, so this is not the correct sequence.
- Answer Choice D: Resource Development - This TTP refers to the collection of resources needed for the attack. The question does not mention the development of resources, so this is not the correct sequence.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the exploitation of a vulnerability, followed by the execution of commands, and finally installing an MSI package. This sequence aligns with the TTP of Execution, which is the execution of a payload or command on the target system.
- Therefore, the most plausible TTP that occurred after the exploitation of the vulnerability is Execution.

Final Answer: B: Execution
