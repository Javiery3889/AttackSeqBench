1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the use of a supply chain compromise through a compromised software update for Initial Access in the SolarWinds Orion platform attack.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Supply chain compromise, software update, Initial Access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Reconnaissance: This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. While reconnaissance is a critical step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the specific sequence of a supply chain compromise and software update.
   - B: Command and Control: This tactic involves establishing communication channels with the compromised systems. It is not the first step in the sequence of an attack, as it typically follows Initial Access.
   - C: Discovery: This tactic involves enumerating and mapping the environment to understand the target's infrastructure. While discovery is important, it is not the immediate precursor to a supply chain compromise.
   - D: Resource Development: This tactic involves acquiring the necessary tools, implants, or other resources to carry out an attack. This could include the development of a malicious software update that would be used in a supply chain compromise.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question suggests that the attacker had to prepare the malicious software update before they could use it to compromise the supply chain and gain Initial Access.
   - Resource Development is the most plausible answer because it aligns with the idea that the attacker needed to develop the compromised software update as a resource for the attack.
   - Reconnaissance, Command and Control, and Discovery are all important steps in the attack lifecycle but do not directly precede the specific sequence of a supply chain compromise and software update.

Final Answer: D: Resource Development
