Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the initial access gained by exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 Office vulnerability.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Initial Access, followed by an action that involves collecting system information using POWERSHOWER.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Initial Access - This is the first step mentioned in the question, so it is already accounted for and not the next step in the sequence.
- Answer Choice B: Discovery - This tactic involves collecting information about the environment to understand the target and plan the next steps. Since the question states that system information is being collected using POWERSHOWER, this is a plausible next step after initial access.
- Answer Choice C: Resource Development - This tactic involves acquiring the necessary tools and resources to support the attack. While this could be a step in the overall attack, it is not directly related to the immediate action of collecting system information.
- Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion - This tactic is used to avoid detection by security systems. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the action of collecting system information.
- Answer Choice E: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with the compromised system. It is not directly related to the action of collecting system information.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access has already occurred, so we are looking for the next step in the sequence.
- The action of collecting system information using POWERSHOWER suggests that the attacker is in the process of understanding the environment and planning further actions.
- The most plausible next step in the sequence is Discovery, as it aligns with the action of collecting system information.

Final Answer: B: Discovery
