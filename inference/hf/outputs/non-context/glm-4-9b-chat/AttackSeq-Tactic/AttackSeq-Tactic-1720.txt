1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and asks which MITRE ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after BRONZE PRESIDENT used tools like Nmap and net user to understand the network environment.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     - Using Nmap and net user
     - Understanding the network environment
     - Targeting specific data types
     - Using custom batch scripts to collate identified files into archives

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which could include scanning the network with tools like Nmap and identifying users with net user. However, it does not necessarily imply the subsequent steps of targeting specific data types or using custom batch scripts.
   - Answer Choice B: Resource Development - This tactic involves acquiring the necessary resources to support the attack, which could include understanding the network environment. It could also involve the steps of targeting specific data types and collating files into archives, as these actions require resources to be developed.
   - Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within the network to access other systems. While understanding the network environment is a part of this, it does not directly lead to the specific actions of targeting data types or using batch scripts.
   - Answer Choice D: Credential Access - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems, which is not directly related to the actions of scanning the network, targeting data types, or using batch scripts.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The use of Nmap and net user is indicative of gathering information about the network environment, which is a part of Resource Development.
   - The subsequent steps of targeting specific data types and using custom batch scripts to collate files into archives are also aligned with Resource Development, as they involve acquiring the necessary resources to support the attack.
   - Collection, Lateral Movement, and Credential Access do not cover the entire sequence of actions described in the question as well as Resource Development does.

Final Answer: B: Resource Development
