Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has already established communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
- The next step in the attack sequence is to send encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: Exfiltration - This tactic involves stealing data from the target environment. While the question mentions sending data, it does not specify that the data is being stolen, so this is not the most direct next step.
- B: Resource Development - This tactic involves gathering resources to support the attack. It does not directly relate to sending data to control servers.
- C: Command and Control - This tactic involves maintaining communication with the attacker's infrastructure. Since the implant has already established communication with control servers, this would be the next logical step to send data to these servers.
- D: Execution - This tactic involves executing malicious code on the target system. It does not relate to sending data to control servers.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question indicates that the implant has already established communication with control servers, which suggests that the implant is now ready to send data to these servers.
- The most plausible next step in the attack sequence, given that the implant is already communicating with control servers, would be to send data to these servers.
- Therefore, the next tactic that most likely occurred is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
