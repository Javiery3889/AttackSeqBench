Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the following actions:
  1. Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts.
  2. Manipulated webmail session keys and browser cookies.
  3. Intercepted HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves evading detection by security solutions. While executing malicious scripts and manipulating session keys and cookies could be part of defense evasion, it does not necessarily imply that this is the tactic that occurred immediately after the scripts were executed.
- Answer Choice B: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial exploitation of a vulnerability to gain a beachhead on a target system. It does not directly relate to the actions described in the question.
- Answer Choice C: Persistence - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system after initial access has been gained. While manipulating session keys and cookies could be part of establishing persistence, it does not explain the sequence of actions described.
- Answer Choice D: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment. Intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials is a clear example of information collection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves the execution of malicious scripts, manipulation of session keys and cookies, and then intercepting HTTPS POST requests. The action of intercepting HTTPS POST requests is a clear example of collecting information, specifically login credentials.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Collection tactic, which aligns with the action of intercepting login credentials.

Final Answer: D: Collection
