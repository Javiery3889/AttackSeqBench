1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving FamousSparrow's SparrowDoor. The sequence includes:
     a. SparrowDoor probing files in specified directories during the Discovery phase.
     b. Communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS as part of Command and Control activities.
   - We need to identify which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Execution - This tactic typically involves the execution of malicious code or actions on the target system. It does not fit the sequence as it comes before the discovery phase.
   - B: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with a command and control server. This is the final step mentioned in the question and not the one that occurred before it.
   - C: Collection - This tactic involves gathering information from the target environment. Probing files in specified directories is a method of information gathering, which fits the description of the Discovery phase.
   - D: Resource Development - This tactic involves the acquisition of resources needed for the attack. It is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

3. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events starts with Discovery, which involves gathering information about the target environment. The action of probing files in specified directories is a technique used for information gathering.
   - The next step is to communicate with the C&C server, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - Based on the sequence provided, the most plausible tactic that occurred after Discovery but before Command and Control is Collection, as it involves the gathering of information that would be useful for the attack.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is Collection.

Final Answer: C: Collection
