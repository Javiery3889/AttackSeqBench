1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the deployment of Industroyer2, which uses the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol to disrupt operations at electrical stations and substations. It also mentions the execution of wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Deployment of Industroyer2
     2. Use of IEC 60870-5-104 protocol
     3. Execution of wipers (CaddyWiper and SoloShred)

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving laterally within a network to access other systems. While lateral movement is a common step in many attacks, the question specifically mentions the disruption of operations at electrical stations and substations, which suggests a more direct impact rather than movement within a network.
   - Answer Choice B: Execution - This tactic refers to the initial deployment and execution of the malware. The question states that Industroyer2 has been deployed and wipers have been executed, so this step has already occurred.
   - Answer Choice C: Impact - This tactic involves the actions that result in the intended effect of the attack, such as data loss, system disruption, or operational impact. The question describes the disruption of operations at electrical stations and substations, which is a direct impact of the attack.
   - Answer Choice D: Discovery - This tactic refers to the attacker's actions to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the target environment. This step is typically not the immediate result of deploying malware and executing wipers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The deployment of Industroyer2 and the execution of wipers are steps that have already occurred, so we are looking for the next logical step in the attack sequence.
   - Step 2: The disruption of operations at electrical stations and substations is a direct result of the malware's actions, indicating that the impact of the attack has already been achieved.
   - Step 3: Given that the impact has been achieved, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be the attacker observing or measuring the effect of the disruption.

Final Answer: C: Impact
