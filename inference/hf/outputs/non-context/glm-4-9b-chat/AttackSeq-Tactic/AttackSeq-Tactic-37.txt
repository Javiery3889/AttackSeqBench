Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a PowerShell script has already avoided detection by operating in memory.
- It also mentions that the script leveraged the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes: avoiding detection, operating in memory, leveraging DCOM, and executing files without saving them to disk.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Credential Access - This tactic involves techniques that are used to obtain credentials, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.
- Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion - This tactic includes techniques that are used to avoid detection and mitigation efforts, which aligns with the actions described in the question (avoiding detection, operating in memory, and executing files without saving them to disk).
- Answer Choice C: Execution - This tactic involves the execution of code or scripts, which is part of the sequence, but it does not encompass the full sequence of actions described.
- Answer Choice D: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing communication with a command and control server, which is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves techniques that are used to evade detection and mitigation efforts, which is a key aspect of the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The PowerShell script's ability to operate in memory and execute files without saving them to disk are both techniques used to avoid detection, which is a core component of Defense Evasion.
- The other answer choices do not fully capture the sequence of actions described in the question.

Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
