Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs: the use of PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes, preparation of intellectual property for exfiltration, and then asks about the tactic that describes how the compromised systems maintained communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Impact - This tactic is about the effects of the attack, not the communication between compromised systems and a server.
- Answer Choice B: Exfiltration - This tactic is about the transfer of data from the compromised system to an external location, which has already been mentioned in the question.
- Answer Choice C: Command and Control - This tactic involves the communication between the compromised systems and the attacker's server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code, which fits the description in the question.
- Answer Choice D: Persistence - This tactic is about maintaining access to a system over time, but it does not specifically address the communication aspect mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the initial infection with PoisonIvy, which is a form of malware that is often used for command and control purposes. After the malware has been used to dump password hashes and prepare data for exfiltration, the next logical step would be for the compromised systems to communicate with a server for further instructions and updates.
- The communication aspect of receiving commands and retrieving binary code is best described by the "Command and Control" tactic.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the use of the "Command and Control" tactic for maintaining communication with a server.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
