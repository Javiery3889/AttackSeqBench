Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the context of an attack involving the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
- The sequence of events includes:
  1. Initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013.
  2. Before achieving persistence by registering a binary to the startup shell.
  3. The BlackEnergy 3 malware begins propagating within the network.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Initial Access - This is the first step mentioned in the question, which is the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013. This is not the TTP that occurred after initial access.
- Answer Choice B: Command and Control - This TTP involves establishing communication with a command and control server. It is not directly related to the propagation of malware within the network.
- Answer Choice C: Discovery - This TTP involves enumerating and mapping the network to find valuable information and potential targets. It is a plausible step before achieving persistence and before the malware begins propagating.
- Answer Choice D: Execution - This TTP involves executing a payload, which would be the initial exploitation of the vulnerability. This has already occurred as per the question.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events in the question starts with initial access, followed by the malware propagating within the network. The TTP that would occur after gaining initial access and before achieving persistence is likely to be one that involves exploring and mapping the network.
- The most plausible TTP that fits this description is "Discovery," as it involves the attacker looking for information and potential targets within the network, which is a logical step before establishing persistence and propagating the malware.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
