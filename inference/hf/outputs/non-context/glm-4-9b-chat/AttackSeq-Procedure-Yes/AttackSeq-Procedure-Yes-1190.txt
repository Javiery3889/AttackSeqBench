Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where attackers have used the RMS tool for reconnaissance and lateral movement within the victim network.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the RMS executable attempted to communicate with a C2 server located in Germany using application layer protocols.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The RMS tool, which stands for Remote Management System, is often used by attackers for reconnaissance and lateral movement. This tool is designed to provide remote access to a network, allowing attackers to move laterally and gather information.
- Communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by attackers to maintain control over compromised systems and to receive instructions.
- Application layer protocols are used for communication between applications running on different hosts, and they are often used for C2 communication due to their ability to bypass some network defenses.
- The question asks if it is likely that the RMS executable used application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server in Germany. Given that the RMS tool is used for lateral movement and C2 communication is a common TTP, it is plausible that the RMS executable would use application layer protocols for C2 communication.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The RMS tool is used for reconnaissance and lateral movement, which suggests that the attackers are actively working within the network.
- Communication with a C2 server is a typical next step for attackers to maintain control and receive further instructions.
- Application layer protocols are commonly used for C2 communication due to their ability to bypass certain defenses.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the RMS executable is likely to have attempted to communicate with a C2 server using application layer protocols.

Final Answer: A: Yes
