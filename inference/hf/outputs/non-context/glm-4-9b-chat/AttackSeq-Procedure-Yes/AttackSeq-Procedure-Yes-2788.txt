Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving an app named XAgent on iOS 7 devices. The sequence includes:
  1. Executing itself in the background.
  2. Hiding its icon.
  3. Restarting when terminated.
  4. Collecting geo-location data as part of its discovery routine.
  5. Sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C (Command and Control) server.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the XAgent app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the XAgent app will not collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a sequence of actions that the XAgent app is likely to perform. The first three actions are about evading detection and persistence on the device. The fourth action, collecting geo-location data, is a common step in many malware routines to gather information about the compromised system and its environment. The fifth action, sending the data to a C&C server, is a typical method for exfiltrating data collected by malware.
- Given that the question specifically mentions that the app is collecting geo-location data as part of its discovery routine, it is reasonable to assume that this is a step in the attack sequence. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the described attack sequence is Answer Choice A: Yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
