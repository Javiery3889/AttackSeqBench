Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document and executing these scripts through macro-triggered events.
- The sequence then asks if it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Initial access: Embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document.
  2. Initial access execution: Executing these scripts through macro-triggered events.
  3. Persistence: Dropping components like `invoker.ps1`.
  4. Defense evasion: Employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that it is likely the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components for persistence and then employ obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that it is not likely the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components for persistence and then employ obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The typical behavior of an attacker after gaining initial access is to establish persistence on the compromised system. This is often done by dropping a component that can be executed to maintain a presence on the system, such as a script like `invoker.ps1`.
- After establishing persistence, the attacker would likely want to evade detection and defense mechanisms. This is commonly achieved by obfuscating the payload, which in this case is the backdoor.
- Given the typical progression of an attack, it is reasonable to assume that the campaign would follow a sequence that includes persistence and then defense evasion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
