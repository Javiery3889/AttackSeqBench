1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines, followed by obtaining capabilities. It then asks whether RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that RIG EK is likely to use malvertising as a method to deliver exploits after obtaining capabilities.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that RIG EK is not likely to use malvertising as a method to deliver exploits after obtaining capabilities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - RIG EK is a well-known exploit kit that has historically been used to deliver malware through various means, including malvertising.
   - Malvertising is a common method used by exploit kits to deliver payloads to victims by exploiting vulnerabilities in browsers or other software.
   - The sequence described in the question involves the initial exploitation of browser vulnerabilities, which is a typical step in the delivery of an exploit kit.
   - After the initial exploitation, it is common for exploit kits to use additional steps to deliver the final payload, which could include redirecting users to malicious advertising pages or compromised websites.
   - Given that RIG EK is known to use malvertising and the sequence of events described aligns with typical exploit kit behavior, it is plausible that RIG EK would use malvertising to deliver exploits.

Final Answer: A: Yes
