Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control (C2) purposes.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The TTPs mentioned in the question are reconnaissance and communication via HTTP POST requests for C2.
- Reconnaissance is a common initial step in an attack, where an attacker gathers information about the target environment.
- Communication via HTTP POST requests for C2 is a plausible method for an implant to communicate with its command and control servers. HTTP POST requests are a common way to send data to a server, and they can be used to send commands and receive data from a C2 server.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The implant has already gathered information, which is a typical initial action in an attack.
- Step 2: The use of HTTP POST requests for C2 is a plausible method of communication, as it is a common and less suspicious way to send data over the internet.
- Step 3: Given that the implant has already performed reconnaissance and HTTP POST requests are a common and stealthy method of communication, it is likely that the implant would use this method for C2.

Final Answer: A: Yes
