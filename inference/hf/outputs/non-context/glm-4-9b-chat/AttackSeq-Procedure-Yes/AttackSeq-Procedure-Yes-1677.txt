1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where WastedLocker ransomware is deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender, which are both TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with the Defense Evasion phase of an attack.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom, which are associated with the Impact phase of an attack.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the Defense Evasion phase, the ransomware will proceed to the Impact phase, encrypting files and demanding a ransom.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the ransomware will not proceed to the Impact phase after the Defense Evasion phase.

   Given the typical behavior of ransomware, after successfully evading defenses, the next logical step is to encrypt files and systems to maximize the impact and demand a ransom. Therefore, the sequence of TTPs would typically follow the Defense Evasion phase with the Impact phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Defense Evasion phase is completed with the use of PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender.
   - Step 2: The ransomware's primary objective is to encrypt files and systems to cause disruption and demand a ransom.
   - Step 3: The Impact phase is the next logical step in the ransomware's lifecycle, following the Defense Evasion phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
