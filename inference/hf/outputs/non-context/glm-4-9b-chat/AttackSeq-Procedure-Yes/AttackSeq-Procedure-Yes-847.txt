1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have completed the discovery phase, which typically involves gathering information about systems, users, and data.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the discovery phase, the attackers will use remote services to move laterally within the network before establishing persistence on new systems.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attackers will not use remote services for lateral movement before installing persistence points.

   Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and typical attacker behavior, the following reasoning can be applied:

   - The discovery phase is often followed by the lateral movement phase, where attackers seek to move within the network to other systems or services that can provide them with more access or valuable information.
   - Exploiting remote services is a common method for lateral movement, as it allows attackers to move from one system to another without being detected by the first system's security controls.
   - Persistence is typically established after the attacker has achieved a certain level of access and control within the network. It is a way to maintain access for future operations.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that after the discovery phase, attackers would exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing persistence points on new systems.

3. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The discovery phase is a precursor to lateral movement.
   - Step 2: Lateral movement is often achieved through exploiting remote services.
   - Step 3: Persistence is established after achieving a level of control, which typically comes after lateral movement.
   - Step 4: Based on the typical sequence of TTPs, it is likely that attackers would exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing persistence points.

Final Answer: A: Yes
