1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that Rocket Kitten is likely to employ in an attack. The sequence mentioned is:
     a. Spear-phishing emails containing malicious payloads for initial access.
     b. Using both simple and advanced tools during execution.
     c. Using debugger evasion techniques for defense evasion.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that Rocket Kitten will indeed follow the described sequence of TTPs.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that Rocket Kitten will not follow the described sequence of TTPs.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Spear-phishing emails are a common initial access vector used by many threat actors, including Rocket Kitten, to deliver malicious payloads.
   - Step 2: After gaining initial access, it is typical for an attacker to use a combination of simple and advanced tools to further their objectives within the compromised network.
   - Step 3: To avoid detection and mitigation efforts, an attacker might use debugger evasion techniques, which are designed to bypass security tools that monitor for malicious behavior.
   - Step 4: Given that each of the TTPs mentioned is a plausible step in an attack by Rocket Kitten, it is reasonable to conclude that they would follow this sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
