Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the collection of files from application and data directories containing communication data.
- The specific TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. Collecting files from application and data directories.
  2. Exfiltrating these files at regular intervals.
  3. Using a Tor hidden service for exfiltration.
  4. Using SSH connections for exfiltration.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that Infamous Chisel is likely to use both a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration after collecting the files.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that Infamous Chisel is not likely to use both a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration after collecting the files.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Infamous Chisel is a known malware that has been associated with the use of Tor for exfiltration. It is designed to steal sensitive information and exfiltrate it to a remote server.
- The use of a Tor hidden service is a plausible TTP for Infamous Chisel, as it aligns with its known behavior to use Tor for anonymizing its exfiltration activities.
- The use of SSH connections for exfiltration is less common for malware like Infamous Chisel. SSH is typically used for secure remote access, not for exfiltrating data.
- The question specifies that the files are exfiltrated "at regular intervals," which suggests a more automated process. While Infamous Chisel is known to exfiltrate data, it is not typically associated with using SSH for this purpose.

Final Answer: B: No
