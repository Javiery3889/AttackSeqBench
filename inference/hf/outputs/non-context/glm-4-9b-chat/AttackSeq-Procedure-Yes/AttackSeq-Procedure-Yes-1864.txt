Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a malware named Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Evades detection by modifying the firmware update process.
  2. Prevents event logging of its operations.
  3. Wipes server disks as part of hiding tracks and potentially disrupting operations.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the malware is capable of wiping server disks.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the malware is not capable of wiping server disks.

To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice:
- The malware has already evaded detection and is modifying the firmware update process, which indicates a high level of sophistication.
- Preventing event logging further supports the idea that the malware is designed to remain undetected and hide its activities.
- Given the context of the question, the malware's ability to wipe server disks would be a plausible next step in the attack sequence. This action would help the attacker hide the tracks of the attack and potentially disrupt the operations of the targeted server.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already demonstrated advanced capabilities in evading detection and hiding its activities.
- The context of the question implies that the malware is part of a broader attack that includes disrupting operations.
- Wiping server disks is a plausible action for a malware that is designed to hide its tracks and cause disruption.

Final Answer: A: Yes
