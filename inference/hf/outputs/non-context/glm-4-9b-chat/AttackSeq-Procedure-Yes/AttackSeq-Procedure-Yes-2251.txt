1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already maintained persistence on a system using methods such as registry keys and VBScripts for MargulasRAT.
   - The question then asks if SideCopy, which is another TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure), is likely to employ tactics to evade detection.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that SideCopy is likely to use tactics to evade detection, such as mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that SideCopy is not likely to use tactics to evade detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: MargulasRAT is a known malware that is designed to provide persistence on a system. Persistence is a common goal for attackers to maintain access to a compromised system over time.
   - Step 2: Persistence is often achieved through various methods, including modifying the system's registry and using scripts like VBScripts.
   - Step 3: SideCopy is another TTP that is likely to be used by an attacker to further their objectives on the compromised system.
   - Step 4: Given that the attacker has already shown an interest in evading detection (by using persistence methods), it is reasonable to assume that they would continue to use tactics to avoid being detected.
   - Step 5: Mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents are common evasion tactics used by malware to avoid detection by security software and users.
   - Conclusion: Based on the attacker's previous behavior and the nature of malware like SideCopy, it is plausible that SideCopy would employ tactics to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
