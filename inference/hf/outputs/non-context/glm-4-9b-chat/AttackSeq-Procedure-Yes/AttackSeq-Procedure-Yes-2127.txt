1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a batch file ('stopedge.bat') scheduling a script ('install.vbs') for persistence, and then the Konni APT Group using heavily obfuscated scripts with techniques like XOR to evade detection. The question also mentions 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs'
     2. 'install.vbs' runs every 33 minutes for persistence
     3. Konni APT Group uses heavily obfuscated scripts with XOR
     4. 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the Konni APT Group is likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts with XOR after 'install.vbs' is scheduled for persistence.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Konni APT Group is not likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts with XOR after 'install.vbs' is scheduled for persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Konni APT Group is known for its sophisticated tactics, which often include the use of obfuscation to evade detection.
   - Step 2: Heavily obfuscated scripts, such as those using XOR, are common techniques used by advanced threat actors to hide their presence and actions on a compromised system.
   - Step 3: The sequence of actions described in the question involves setting up persistence with 'install.vbs' and then gathering system details with 'versioninfo.bat'. This suggests a typical post-infection activity where the attacker would want to remain undetected.
   - Step 4: Given the context of the question and the known behavior of the Konni APT Group, it is plausible that they would use obfuscation techniques like XOR to avoid detection by security tools that might be scanning for 'versioninfo.bat' and other system details.

Final Answer: A: Yes
