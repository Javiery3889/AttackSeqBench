Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke, a known threat actor, has already searched removable drives and skipped certain file types during collection.
- The question then asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question are:
  1. Searching removable drives
  2. Skipping certain file types during collection
  3. Using a keylogger
  4. Using a screenshotter
  5. Using a clipboard stealer
  6. Exfiltrating data to remote servers via FTP

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to use the mentioned TTPs in the sequence provided.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to use the mentioned TTPs in the sequence provided.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- CosmicDuke is known for its targeted attacks on government and military organizations, often involving the exfiltration of sensitive information.
- The sequence of actions described in the question is consistent with the typical behavior of an attacker looking to gather as much information as possible before exfiltrating it.
- The use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer would allow CosmicDuke to collect a wide range of information, including keystrokes, screenshots, and clipboard contents, which are valuable for espionage purposes.
- Exfiltrating the data via FTP is a common method for transferring large amounts of data discreetly.

Based on the typical behavior of CosmicDuke and the logical sequence of actions for gathering and exfiltrating information, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use the mentioned TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
