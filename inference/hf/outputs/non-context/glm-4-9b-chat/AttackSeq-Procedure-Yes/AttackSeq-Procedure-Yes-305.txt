1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that likely occurred in a cyber attack. The sequence includes:
     a. Exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter.
     b. Use of malicious docx files containing obfuscated code.
     c. The malware establishing communication with a compromised server for command and control (C2).
     d. The IP address of the compromised server is 137.74.224[.]142.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is plausible.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not plausible.

To evaluate the plausibility of the sequence, let's consider the following:
   - Phishing campaigns often use malicious documents to deliver malware. The use of docx files is a common method for delivering malware.
   - Obfuscated code within these files can help evade detection by security software.
   - Exploiting a vulnerability in a software component, such as an EPS filter, is a known method for delivering malware.
   - Establishing communication with a C2 server is a typical step in a malware campaign for receiving instructions and exfiltrating data.

Given these points, the sequence described in the question is a plausible sequence of TTPs for a cyber attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Phishing campaigns commonly use malicious documents to deliver malware, which is consistent with the use of docx files.
   - Step 2: Obfuscated code within these documents is a technique to bypass security measures, which is also consistent with the described TTP.
   - Step 3: Exploiting a software vulnerability is a well-documented method for delivering malware, making this part of the sequence plausible.
   - Step 4: Establishing communication with a C2 server is a standard procedure for malware to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
