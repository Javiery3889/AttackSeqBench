1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker, referred to as "Longhorn," gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - The question then asks whether Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Vault 7 documents are a set of documents leaked in 2017 that contain information on various cyber espionage tools and techniques used by the NSA and other entities.
   - These documents are known to include guidelines on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for evading detection and maintaining persistence on a compromised system.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is: 
     1. Exploit a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document (Delivery).
     2. Infect the target with Plexor malware (Execution).
     3. Perform detailed system fingerprinting for discovery (Reconnaissance).
   - Answer Choice A: Yes, Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.
     - This answer suggests that Longhorn would use the guidelines from Vault 7 to avoid detection before moving on to the next phase of the attack.
   - Answer Choice B: No, Longhorn's tools will not follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.
     - This answer suggests that Longhorn would not use the guidelines from Vault 7 and would proceed with the attack without attempting to avoid detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Longhorn has already executed a sophisticated attack by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, which indicates a high level of planning and execution.
   - Step 2: Given the complexity of the initial attack, it is reasonable to assume that Longhorn would be aware of the importance of evading detection to maintain persistence on the compromised system.
   - Step 3: The Vault 7 documents provide a wealth of information on evading detection, which would be valuable for an attacker looking to remain undetected.
   - Step 4: Performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery is a critical step in understanding the target environment and planning further attacks. It is in Longhorn's interest to avoid detection during this phase to maintain operational security.
   - Conclusion: Based on the above reasoning, it is likely that Longhorn would follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

Final Answer: A: Yes
