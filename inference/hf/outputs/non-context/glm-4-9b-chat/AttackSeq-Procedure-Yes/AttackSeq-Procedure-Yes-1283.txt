Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of Equation Editor exploits, execution of an installer package with malicious payloads, and the potential use of Tropic Trooper to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe, followed by injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Use Equation Editor exploits
  2. Execute an installer package with malicious payloads
  3. Execute the FakeRun loader
  4. Launch dllhost.exe
  5. Inject a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that Tropic Trooper is likely to follow the described sequence of TTPs.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that Tropic Trooper is not likely to follow the described sequence of TTPs.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible sequence of steps that a threat actor might take to establish persistence on a compromised system. Typically, after delivering a payload, an attacker would look to establish a more stealthy and persistent presence on the system.
- The use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package is a common initial access vector. Once the installer is executed, it is likely that the attacker would want to further their presence on the system.
- The FakeRun loader is a known tool used by Tropic Trooper to load malicious payloads. It is plausible that Tropic Trooper would use it to launch dllhost.exe, which is a common process for loading DLLs.
- Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe is a common technique for maintaining persistence on a system, as dllhost.exe is often used to load DLLs and can be used to hide the presence of malicious code.

Final Answer: A: Yes
