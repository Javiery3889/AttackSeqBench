1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the FlowCloud macro, which renames files and executes 'gup.exe' using 'certutil.exe' (Temptcm.tmp). The next step in the sequence is whether 'Gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe', which is intended to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the initial execution of 'gup.exe' by the FlowCloud macro, 'Gup.exe' will proceed to execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' for the purpose of extracting and installing payload file components for persistence.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that 'Gup.exe' will not execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' as described.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The question describes a sequence where 'gup.exe' is executed by the FlowCloud macro using 'certutil.exe'.
   - Step 2: The next step in the sequence is whether 'Gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe'.
   - Step 3: The context implies that 'Gup.exe' is part of the attack chain, and if it is designed to execute other components, it would be consistent with the behavior of a malware to perform additional actions after initial execution.
   - Step 4: Since the question states that 'EhStorAuthn.exe' is intended to extract and install payload file components for persistence, it is plausible that 'Gup.exe' would execute it as part of the attack sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
