Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by FIN13.
- The sequence mentioned is:
  1. FIN13 uses utilities such as ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory.
  2. FIN13 executes passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the initial steps, FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the described TTPs do not involve exploiting external servers or deploying web shells for initial access.

Given the information provided, the sequence of TTPs involves using ProcDump to dump memory and executing a passive backdoor for command execution. These actions are typically associated with lateral movement within a network rather than establishing initial access. Exploiting external servers and deploying web shells are more commonly associated with the initial stages of an attack, where an attacker gains access to a network.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first TTP involves using a tool to dump memory, which is often used to extract credentials or other sensitive information from a compromised system.
- The second TTP involves executing a passive backdoor, which is designed to maintain persistence on the compromised system and allow for remote command execution.
- Both of these actions are indicative of lateral movement within a network rather than the initial access phase.
- Exploiting external servers and deploying web shells are more characteristic of initial access methods, which is not what the question describes.

Final Answer: B: No
