Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker, referred to as "The Inception attackers," might use in a cyber attack. The sequence includes reconnaissance using spear phishing, exploitation of CVE-2017-11882, and deployment of a PowerShell backdoor called POWERSHOWER.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Reconnaissance using spear phishing
  2. Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882
  3. Deployment of the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after gathering information through spear phishing, the attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attackers will not follow the described sequence, either by not exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or not using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor.

To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice:
- Spear phishing is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, as it allows attackers to gather information about their targets and deliver malicious payloads.
- CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Word that allows for remote code execution. It is plausible that attackers would exploit this vulnerability if they have identified it as a target.
- Remote templates in Microsoft Word are a known vector for exploiting CVE-2017-11882. This technique is often used to deliver malicious payloads without requiring user interaction.
- The PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER is a known tool used by attackers to maintain persistence on a compromised system. It is plausible that the attackers would use such a tool after gaining initial access.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible attack pattern. It starts with reconnaissance, which is a logical first step, followed by the exploitation of a known vulnerability, and finally deploying a backdoor for persistence.
- Given the context of the question and the typical progression of an attack, it is likely that the attackers would exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.

Final Answer: A: Yes
