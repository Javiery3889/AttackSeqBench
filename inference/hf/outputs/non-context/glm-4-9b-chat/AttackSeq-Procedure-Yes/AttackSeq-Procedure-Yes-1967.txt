Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a threat actor, known as StellarParticle, has used AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The use of AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information suggests that the threat actor is attempting to enumerate and gather information within the network.
- The question implies that the threat actor has already accessed the network and is now moving laterally to access data from Information Repositories.
- Typically, when a threat actor moves laterally within a network, they may use both privileged and non-privileged accounts to gain access to different systems and data sources.
- Privileged accounts often provide higher levels of access and can be used to bypass security controls more easily, while non-privileged accounts may be used to blend in and avoid detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets is indicative of a threat actor who is actively probing the network and gathering information.
- The act of moving laterally suggests that the threat actor is actively seeking to expand their access within the network.
- Given the nature of such an attack, it is plausible that the threat actor would use both privileged and non-privileged accounts to achieve their objectives.
- The use of RDP for lateral movement is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) in cyber attacks, as RDP can be used to access systems remotely and move between them.

Final Answer: A: Yes
