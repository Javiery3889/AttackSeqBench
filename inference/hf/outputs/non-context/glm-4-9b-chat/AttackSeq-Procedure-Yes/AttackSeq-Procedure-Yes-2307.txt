Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an adversary is using Cobalt Strike for lateral movement within a network.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
  1. Leveraging built-in lateral movement capabilities in Cobalt Strike.
  2. Identifying target systems and data of interest.
  3. Copying results of the discovery phase (file and directory lists from network shared drives).
  4. Exfiltrating the data using cloud storage web services.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after identifying the target systems and data, the adversary will copy the results and then exfiltrate the data using cloud storage web services.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the adversary will not copy the results and exfiltrate the data using cloud storage web services.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The typical behavior of an adversary during a cyber attack is to gather as much information as possible before exfiltrating data. This is because having a comprehensive understanding of the target environment can help the adversary to better plan their attack and avoid detection.
- The question states that the adversary has already leveraged lateral movement capabilities to identify target systems and data of interest. This indicates that the adversary is in the process of gathering information.
- Copying the results of the discovery phase (file and directory lists from network shared drives) is a logical step in this process, as it allows the adversary to have a record of the data they have identified.
- Exfiltrating the data using cloud storage web services is a common method for adversaries to transfer stolen data out of the compromised network without raising suspicion, as cloud services are often used for legitimate purposes and can be harder to monitor.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the adversary will copy the results before exfiltrating the data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
