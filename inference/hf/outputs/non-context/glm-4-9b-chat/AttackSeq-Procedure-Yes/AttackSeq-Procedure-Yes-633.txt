Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving privilege escalation using a Metasploit module, followed by a command and control (C&C) server contact and domain resolution.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Privilege Escalation using Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll
  2. Contacting a C&C server at https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ
  3. Resolving the domain psychology-blog.ezua[.]com to the IP address 209.239.115[.]91

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that the shellcode will indeed contact the C&C server and resolve the domain as described.
- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that the shellcode will not contact the C&C server or resolve the domain as described.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a typical pattern in cyber attacks where the attacker first escalates privileges to gain more control over the system, then establishes a connection to a C&C server for further instructions, and finally resolves a domain to an IP address to communicate with the C&C server.
- The fact that the shellcode contacts the C&C server at the specified URL and resolves the domain to the same IP address is consistent with this pattern.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the shellcode will perform these actions as described in the question.

Final Answer: A: Yes
