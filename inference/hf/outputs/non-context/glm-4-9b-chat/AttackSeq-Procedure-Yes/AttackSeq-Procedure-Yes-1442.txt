Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) is exploited via email attachments to drop the Taidoor malware.
- The malware then opens a decoy document for initial access.
- The question asks if it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its Command and Control (CnC) servers (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw) using a modified traffic pattern.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid detection.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Taidoor is known to be a sophisticated malware that is designed to evade detection and maintain persistence on an infected system.
- It is common for malware to evolve to avoid detection by security systems, especially when communicating with CnC servers.
- The use of a modified traffic pattern is a typical technique used by malware to avoid signature-based detection systems.
- Given the nature of Taidoor and the context of the question, it is reasonable to assume that it would attempt to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
