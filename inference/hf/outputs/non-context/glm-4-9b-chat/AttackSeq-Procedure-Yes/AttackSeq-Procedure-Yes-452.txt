1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the Geumseong121 APT group distributing a malicious app through a website that appears to support North Korean defectors.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     - Distributing a malicious app through a deceptive website.
     - Disguising the app to evade suspicion.
     - Leveraging app functionalities to communicate with Dropbox and Yandex.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the Geumseong121 APT group did disguise the North Korean fundraising apps to evade suspicion before using them to communicate with Dropbox and Yandex.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Geumseong121 APT group did not disguise the apps and went straight to using them for communication.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The question states that the malicious app was distributed through a website disguised as a charity site. This is a classic TTP (Tactic: Phishing) used by APT groups to deceive users.
   - Step 2: The question also mentions that the group disguised the apps to evade suspicion. This is a TTP (Tactic: Disguise) that is often used to avoid detection by security systems.
   - Step 3: The final part of the question describes the group leveraging app functionalities to communicate with Dropbox and Yandex. This is a TTP (Tactic: Command and Control) that involves using legitimate services to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.
   - Step 4: Given that the question explicitly states that the apps were disguised to evade suspicion, it is reasonable to conclude that the group took additional steps to hide their activities.
   - Step 5: Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the answer choice that the group did disguise the apps.

Final Answer: A: Yes
