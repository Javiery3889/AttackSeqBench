1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are likely to be used by an attacker named FamousSparrow. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Execution: cmd.exe is used to execute SparrowDoor backdoor.
     - Discovery: Collect system information and probe files.
     - Credential Access: Dump credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that FamousSparrow will perform the described sequence of TTPs.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that FamousSparrow will perform the described sequence of TTPs.

   Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and common cyber attack patterns, it is plausible that an attacker would follow a sequence of TTPs in the order of Execution, Discovery, and Credential Access. The Execution phase is the initial entry into the system, Discovery is used to gather information about the environment, and Credential Access is used to obtain credentials for further lateral movement or to maintain persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The attacker, FamousSparrow, executes the SparrowDoor backdoor using cmd.exe, which is a common method for executing malicious payloads.
   - Step 2: After gaining access, the attacker would likely proceed to the Discovery phase to understand the environment better, which includes collecting system information and probing files.
   - Step 3: With the necessary information about the system, the attacker would then move on to the Credential Access phase to extract credentials, which is a common goal for attackers to maintain access or to use for lateral movement.
   - Conclusion: Given the typical progression of an attack, it is reasonable to assume that FamousSparrow would follow this sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
