Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the use of spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.
- It then asks if Moafee and DragonOK will utilize custom-built backdoors and RATs (Remote Access Trojans) during resource development.
- The question also mentions that they will use environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to execute their payloads.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after gaining access through spear-phishing, Moafee and DragonOK will develop custom backdoors and RATs, and then use environment-based evasion techniques.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that Moafee and DragonOK will not use custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development, nor will they use environment-based evasion techniques.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) described in the question is as follows:
  1. Initial access via spear-phishing emails.
  2. Development of custom-built backdoors and RATs.
  3. Use of environment-based evasion techniques to execute payloads.

- Custom-built backdoors and RATs are common tools used by attackers to maintain persistence on a compromised system. They are often developed to evade detection and provide remote access to the attacker.
- Environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, are used to ensure that the payload is only executed in a specific environment, which can be a way to avoid detection by security tools that might be looking for common malicious behaviors.

- Given that the question implies a sophisticated attack, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would use such tools and techniques. Therefore, Answer Choice A aligns with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threats (APTs) like Moafee and DragonOK.

Final Answer: A: Yes
