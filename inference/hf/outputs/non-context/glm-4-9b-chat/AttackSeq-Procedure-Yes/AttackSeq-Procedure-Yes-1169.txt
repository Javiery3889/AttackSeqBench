Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a malware, Longhorn, is configured to use a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C (Command and Control) communication over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol.
- The malware is also set to perform scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. Configuring a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication.
  2. Using HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol.
  3. Scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that Longhorn's malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that Longhorn's malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

Given the context of the question, the malware's behavior is designed to be stealthy and avoid detection. The use of a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS is a common method to ensure secure and隐蔽的 communication. Scheduled exfiltration is also a tactic used to avoid detection by evading upload limits and by not communicating at consistent intervals.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware's use of a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS is a measure to ensure secure and stealthy communication.
- The scheduled exfiltration is a method to avoid detection by not communicating at predictable times or exceeding upload limits.
- Both of these TTPs are consistent with the goal of evading detection, which is a common objective of malware.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware is likely to communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
