Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that likely occur in a cyber attack. The sequence includes:
  1. Initial reconnaissance to gather system and network information.
  2. Communication with control servers using an encrypted channel.
  3. Exfiltration of data obfuscated with Base64 encoding to the control server.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the Rising Sun implant will follow the described sequence of TTPs.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Rising Sun implant will not follow the described sequence of TTPs.

To evaluate the answer choices, we need to consider the typical behavior of a malware implant like the Rising Sun. Malware often performs reconnaissance to gather information about the target environment. After reconnaissance, it may establish a communication channel with a control server, which is often encrypted to avoid detection. Finally, the malware may exfiltrate data, which is commonly obfuscated to evade detection during transmission.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The typical behavior of a malware implant aligns with the sequence described in the question. It is common for malware to:
  1. Gather information about the target system and network.
  2. Communicate with a command and control (C2) server using encrypted channels to avoid detection.
  3. Exfiltrate data, often obfuscated to evade detection during transmission.

Given this typical behavior, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant would follow the described sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
