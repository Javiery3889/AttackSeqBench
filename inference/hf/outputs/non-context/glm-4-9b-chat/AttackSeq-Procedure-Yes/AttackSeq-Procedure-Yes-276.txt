Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious Microsoft Word document is delivered inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
  1. Delivery of a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file.
  2. Execution of a 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script.
  3. Decoding and execution of a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.
  4. Downloading a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before it downloads the zip file containing the malware payload.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will not decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before it downloads the zip file containing the malware payload.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The typical sequence of an attack using a PowerShell script would involve the script performing its primary function before branching out to download additional components.
- The primary function of the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script, as described, is to decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.
- It is logical that this primary function would be executed before the script proceeds to download additional components, such as a zip file containing the malware payload.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question suggests that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will indeed decode and execute the base64 encoded script before downloading the zip file.

Final Answer: A: Yes
