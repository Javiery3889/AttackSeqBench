1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks whether it is likely that RIG EK (a known exploit kit) delivers exploits through malvertising, which involves redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites, followed by running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Malvertising (redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites)
     2. Running an obfuscated PowerShell script
     3. Fetching malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is a plausible method for RIG EK to deliver exploits.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not a plausible method for RIG EK to deliver exploits.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - RIG EK is known for its use of malvertising to deliver exploits. Malvertising is a common method for exploit kits to redirect users to malicious sites.
   - The use of an obfuscated PowerShell script is also a common technique in modern cyber attacks, as it helps to evade detection by security software.
   - Fetching malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter is a plausible step, as PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute malicious payloads.
   - Given that all the steps in the question's sequence are common and plausible TTPs associated with RIG EK, it is likely that this is how RIG EK operates.

Final Answer: A: Yes
