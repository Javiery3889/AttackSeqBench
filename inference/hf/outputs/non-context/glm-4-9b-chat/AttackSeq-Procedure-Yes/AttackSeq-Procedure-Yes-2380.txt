1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where LightNeuron, a malware, discovers system network configurations using specific functions (GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName).
   - The question then asks if it is likely for the malware to collect emails and local files automatically for eventual exfiltration via its backdoor functions.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question are:
     1. Discovery of system network configurations.
     2. Collection of emails and local files.
     3. Exfiltration via backdoor functions.
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after discovering system network configurations, LightNeuron will automatically collect emails and local files for exfiltration.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that LightNeuron will not automatically collect emails and local files after discovering system network configurations.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: LightNeuron is known to discover system network configurations, which is a typical initial step for malware to understand the environment it is operating in.
   - Step 2: The next logical step for a malware that has discovered network configurations would be to gather more information about the system, which could include collecting emails and local files.
   - Step 3: The final step would be to exfiltrate the collected data, which is a common objective for malware.
   - Step 4: While it is plausible that LightNeuron could collect emails and local files, the question specifies that this collection is to be "automatically" and via "backdoor functions." The initial TTPs do not inherently suggest that the collection is automatic or that it uses backdoor functions specifically.
   - Step 5: Without explicit information that LightNeuron's behavior is to automatically collect data via backdoor functions, it is not a given that this will occur.

Final Answer: B: No
