Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the deployment of malware components (downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers) on victims' systems.
- The question then asks if the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) is likely to maintain persistence on these systems using autorun registry settings and malware.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The Darkhotel APT is known for its sophisticated tactics, which often include persistence mechanisms to maintain a presence on compromised systems.
- Autorun registry settings are a common method used by malware to ensure that it runs automatically every time the system starts up, thus maintaining persistence.
- Given that the Darkhotel APT is sophisticated and the question mentions the deployment of malware components that would likely require persistence, it is reasonable to assume that the APT would use autorun registry settings to maintain its presence on the compromised systems.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Darkhotel APT is known for its persistence mechanisms.
- Autorun registry settings are a common persistence mechanism used by malware.
- The question describes the deployment of malware components that would benefit from persistence.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the Darkhotel APT would use autorun registry settings to maintain persistence on compromised systems.

Final Answer: A: Yes
