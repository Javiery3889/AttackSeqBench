1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving two phases: Credential Access and Lateral Movement.
   - The Credential Access phase involves leveraging spear-phishing campaigns to harvest credentials.
   - The Lateral Movement phase is where the attacker moves deeper into the victim networks.
   - The question asks if APT28, a known threat actor, is likely to use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers before moving deeper into the victim networks in the Lateral Movement phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - APT28, also known as Fancy Bear or Sofacy, is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, often involving spear-phishing as an initial entry vector.
   - The use of known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) for many advanced persistent threats, including APT28.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that after obtaining credentials, the next logical step would be to exploit these credentials to gain access to more systems, which could include internet-facing servers.
   - The question implies that the attacker is moving deeper into the network, which typically involves accessing more critical systems, often those that are more exposed to the internet.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: APT28 is known to use spear-phishing as an initial attack vector, which is consistent with the Credential Access phase described in the question.
   - Step 2: After obtaining credentials, the next step in a typical attack sequence would be to use these credentials to gain access to additional systems.
   - Step 3: Exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers is a common method for attackers to move laterally within a network.
   - Step 4: The question asks if this is likely, and given the typical behavior of APT28 and the nature of the Lateral Movement phase, it is reasonable to assume that they would use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
