Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that have already occurred: gathering information on processes and memory utilization, and scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase.
- The question then asks if Regin, a known advanced persistent threat (APT), is likely to perform two additional actions: monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Regin is a sophisticated malware known for its ability to monitor and steal information from infected systems. It is designed to be stealthy and persistent.
- The initial actions described in the question are typical of the discovery phase of an APT, where the attacker is mapping the environment and looking for sensitive information.
- Given Regin's capabilities and the nature of the discovery phase, it is plausible that the next steps would involve gathering more information, which could include monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic to identify and collect data that could be of interest to the attacker.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The discovery phase is a critical time for an attacker to gather as much information as possible about the target environment.
- Regin is known to perform extensive surveillance and data collection.
- Monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic are common techniques used by APTs to gather information about the network and the data being transmitted.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Regin would likely perform these actions after the initial discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
