1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where recipients receive spear phishing emails with RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750 for delivering QuasarRAT.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes: sending spear phishing emails, exploiting CVE-2017-8750, and delivering QuasarRAT.
   - The question asks whether the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before they get infected with QuasarRAT.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the recipients will see a document that appears to be a legitimate blog post or report before they are infected with QuasarRAT.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the recipients will not see a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before they are infected with QuasarRAT.

   In the context of spear phishing attacks, it is common for attackers to use social engineering techniques to make their malicious content appear legitimate. This often involves crafting emails that mimic well-known entities or topics that are relevant to the target audience. The use of CVE-2017-8750, which is an RTF vulnerability, is a known method for delivering malware without requiring user interaction beyond opening the document. However, the question specifically mentions that the document is a "link to RTF documents," which implies that the user would need to click on the link to download the document.

   Given this context, it is plausible that the attackers would use a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report to entice the user to click on the link and download the malicious RTF document. This is a common TTP in spear phishing campaigns.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Recognize that spear phishing attacks often involve social engineering to make malicious content appear legitimate.
   - Step 2: Understand that the question describes a scenario where recipients receive emails with links to RTF documents.
   - Step 3: Consider that the use of CVE-2017-8750 suggests that the attackers are aiming for a silent download of the malicious RTF document.
   - Step 4: Acknowledge that the question asks if the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before infection.
   - Step 5: Conclude that it is likely that the attackers would use such a document to entice the user to click on the link.

Final Answer: A: Yes
