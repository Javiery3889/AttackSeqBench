Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already used initially infected servers as a pivot for lateral movement and to infect USB devices. The question then asks if the Volatile Cedar campaign is likely to use a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control (C2) operations through application layer protocols.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the Volatile Cedar campaign is likely to use a sophisticated C2 infrastructure that involves multiple layers of servers and communicates through application layer protocols.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Volatile Cedar campaign is unlikely to use a complex C2 infrastructure and may use simpler methods for command and control.

Given the nature of advanced persistent threats (APTs) like the Volatile Cedar campaign, it is common for them to use sophisticated C2 infrastructures. These campaigns often involve multi-tiered server backend frameworks to obfuscate their operations and to maintain persistence on the network. Application layer protocols are also commonly used for C2 communications due to their ability to blend in with legitimate traffic and evade detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Volatile Cedar campaign is known for its advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which typically include the use of complex C2 infrastructures.
- Multi-tiered server backend frameworks are a characteristic of sophisticated APTs, as they provide redundancy and the ability to scale operations.
- Application layer protocols are often used for C2 because they can be harder to detect and block compared to lower layer protocols.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Volatile Cedar campaign would leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control operations through application layer protocols.

Final Answer: A: Yes
