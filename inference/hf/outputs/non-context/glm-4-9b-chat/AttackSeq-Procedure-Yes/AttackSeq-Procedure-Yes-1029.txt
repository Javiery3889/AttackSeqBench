1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the deployment of malware, the search for sensitive documents, and taking screenshots during the collection phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically upload harvested documents to the Command and Control (C&C) server during the exfiltration phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the malware is designed to automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server as part of the exfiltration phase.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the malware does not automatically upload the harvested documents and requires some manual intervention or a trigger to start the exfiltration process.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial deployment of malware is a common step in many attack sequences, and the subsequent collection of sensitive documents and screenshots is also a typical behavior for malware designed to steal information.
   - Step 2: The exfiltration phase is where the collected data is sent back to the attacker. In many cases, malware is designed to automatically exfiltrate data to avoid detection and to maintain persistence on the compromised system.
   - Step 3: Given that the malware has already been deployed and is actively collecting data, it is reasonable to assume that it is also designed to exfiltrate this data without manual intervention to maximize its effectiveness and reduce the risk of detection.
   - Step 4: Therefore, it is likely that the malware will automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
