Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where Elirks malware retrieves its command and control (C2) server address.
- The method of retrieval is through accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites.
- The attackers created accounts on these platforms to post encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that Elirks malware retrieves its C2 server address by accessing microblog services or social networking sites as described.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that Elirks malware retrieves its C2 server address in the manner described.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The description of the TTPs in the question indicates a method of exfiltrating or retrieving C2 server information that is unconventional and relies on human-operated platforms for communication.
- Elirks malware, being a sophisticated piece of malware, is likely to use complex methods to avoid detection and to maintain persistence on the compromised systems.
- The use of microblog services or social networking sites to post encoded C2 server addresses is a plausible method for attackers to communicate with their malware without relying on traditional C2 infrastructure.
- This method also aligns with the idea that attackers may use social engineering techniques to bypass security measures.

Final Answer: A: Yes
