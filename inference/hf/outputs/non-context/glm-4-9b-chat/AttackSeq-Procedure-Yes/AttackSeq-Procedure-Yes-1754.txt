1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that Shuckworm is likely to use in an attack. The sequence mentioned is:
     a. Executing malicious VBS scripts to maintain presence.
     b. Deploying a custom backdoor.
     c. Using mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions.
     d. Employing HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after deploying the custom backdoor, Shuckworm is likely to use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before using HTTP-based C&C servers.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that Shuckworm is not likely to use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before using HTTP-based C&C servers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial TTPs described involve the execution of malicious VBS scripts and deployment of a custom backdoor, which are common steps in the Shuckworm attack pattern.
   - Step 2: The next logical step in the sequence would be to establish persistence and evade detection. Using mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions is a technique that can help achieve this by evading security measures that restrict the execution of certain applications.
   - Step 3: After bypassing application control solutions, the attacker would likely need to establish communication with their command and control (C&C) servers to download additional tools or receive instructions. Using HTTP-based C&C servers is a common method for this purpose.
   - Step 4: Based on the typical attack pattern of Shuckworm and the logical progression of TTPs, it is plausible that the attacker would use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before employing HTTP-based C&C servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
