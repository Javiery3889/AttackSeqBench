1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the SombRAT backdoor. The sequence mentioned includes the Discovery phase, where the backdoor performs process discovery and system information discovery.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will communicate with C2 (Command and Control) servers using specific proxy tools (pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY) to implement protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The SombRAT backdoor is a known malware that is designed to perform various malicious activities on an infected system, including communication with its C2 servers.
   - The Discovery phase is a common step in malware operations where the malware gathers information about the system to understand its environment and find potential targets.
   - The use of proxy tools and protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and to communicate with C2 servers without being easily blocked by firewalls or network monitoring tools.

Given this context, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: Yes - This answer suggests that it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will use the mentioned proxy tools and protocol tunneling methods to communicate with C2 servers. This is plausible because such techniques are commonly used by malware to maintain stealthy communication channels.

B: No - This answer suggests that it is not likely that the SombRAT backdoor will use the mentioned proxy tools and protocol tunneling methods. However, this is less plausible given the common use of such techniques by malware for evading detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The SombRAT backdoor is designed to communicate with C2 servers, which is a typical behavior for malware.
   - Step 2: The use of proxy tools and protocol tunneling is a common method for evading detection and is often used by malware.
   - Step 3: The Discovery phase is a standard step in malware operations where the malware gathers information about the system, which could include setting up communication channels.
   - Step 4: Based on the common tactics used by malware and the context of the question, it is reasonable to conclude that the SombRAT backdoor would use these techniques.

Final Answer: A: Yes
