Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the delivery of malware, execution of a VB Script, and the potential creation of a new process to execute a dropped '.exe' file.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Delivery of malware via 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'.
2. Execution of the embedded VB Script.
3. Dropped decoy Microsoft Word file is opened.
4. Malware rewrites itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.
5. Malware creates a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the malware will not create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question indicates that the malware has already executed the VB Script and opened the decoy file. This is a common technique used in spear-phishing attacks to evade detection and trick the user into interacting with the decoy file.
- After executing the VB Script and opening the decoy file, the malware is likely to perform additional actions to establish persistence on the system. This often includes dropping a malicious executable file in a location that is less likely to be scanned by security software, such as the %Temp% folder.
- The use of a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension is a common method to avoid detection, as these files are often overlooked by security software.
- Given that the malware has already executed the VB Script and is attempting to establish persistence, it is plausible that it would create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file to ensure that it remains active on the system.

Final Answer: A: Yes
