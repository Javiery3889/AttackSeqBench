Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an app collects sensitive information from an iOS device and then performs routines on the device.
- The question then asks if it is likely for the app to send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Collect information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data)
  2. Perform routines on the iOS device
  3. Send information via HTTP
  4. Upload files via FTP protocol

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This suggests that the app is likely to use HTTP for sending information and FTP for uploading files.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This suggests that the app is not likely to use HTTP for sending information and FTP for uploading files.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- In the context of a typical cyber attack, the collection of sensitive information and the execution of routines on the victim's device are common initial steps.
- The next step in the attack sequence would be to exfiltrate the collected information back to the attacker's server. HTTP is a common protocol for exfiltrating data due to its widespread use and the fact that it is less likely to trigger security alerts compared to other protocols.
- After the information is exfiltrated, the attacker might upload files to the same server or another server for further analysis or to use as part of the attack. FTP is a common protocol for uploading files due to its simplicity and the fact that it is designed for file transfer.

Based on the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack and the common use of HTTP and FTP for exfiltration and file transfer, it is plausible that the app would send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP as part of its C2 operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
