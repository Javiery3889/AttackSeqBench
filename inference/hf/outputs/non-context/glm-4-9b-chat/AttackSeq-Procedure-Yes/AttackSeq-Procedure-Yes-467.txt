1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access to Turkish financial organizations.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Spear phishing emails
     2. Malicious Word document
     3. Exploitation of CVE-2018-4878
     4. Development of Bankshot implants
     5. Full control over victim systems
     6. Wiping files from the targeted system
   - The tactic of Resource Development, according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, involves the collection of resources that will be used in the attack. This could include developing tools, implants, or other resources that will be used to achieve the objectives of the attack.
   - Given that the question suggests that Hidden Cobra has already gained initial access using a spear phishing attack, it is plausible that they would continue to develop additional tools and implants to maintain persistence and control over the compromised systems.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access is gained through a spear phishing attack, which is a common method used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) like Hidden Cobra.
   - Step 2: The use of a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878) is a typical technique for APTs to establish a beachhead in a target network.
   - Step 3: The development of Bankshot implants is a plausible next step for an APT to maintain control over the compromised systems, as Bankshot is a known set of tools used by Hidden Cobra.
   - Step 4: The capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and to wipe files are consistent with the objectives of an APT, which often aim to disrupt operations or exfiltrate data.
   - Step 5: Since the question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra would develop these capabilities under the tactic of Resource Development, and given that the development of such tools aligns with the objectives of an APT and the nature of the initial attack, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a plausible sequence of events.

Final Answer: A: Yes
