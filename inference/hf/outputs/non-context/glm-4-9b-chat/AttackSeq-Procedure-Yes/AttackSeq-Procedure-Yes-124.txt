Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of an 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, communication with C2 servers over HTTP, and actions such as updating relays or downloading files. The question then asks if it is likely that Agrius, the actor behind these actions, deployed wipers like 'Apostle' that were later turned into functioning ransomware to destroy data on targeted systems.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is plausible that Agrius would use wipers like 'Apostle' after establishing a backdoor and communicating with C2 servers.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not plausible that Agrius would use wipers like 'Apostle' after establishing a backdoor and communicating with C2 servers.

To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice:
- The use of a backdoor like 'IPsec Helper' is a common initial step in an attack to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
- Communicating with C2 servers over HTTP and performing actions such as updating relays or downloading files is indicative of a targeted attack where the actor is actively managing their presence on the compromised network.
- The deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' is a destructive action that could be used to erase evidence of the attack or to cause significant damage to the target's data.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The initial use of a backdoor and C2 communication is consistent with a targeted attack.
- Step 2: The subsequent actions of updating relays and downloading files suggest the actor is actively working to maintain and expand their presence on the network.
- Step 3: The deployment of a wiper like 'Apostle' is a plausible next step in a targeted attack, especially if the goal is to cause significant damage or to erase evidence of the intrusion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
