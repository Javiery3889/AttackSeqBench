1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker has deployed Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery from a different infrastructure.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     - Deployment of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.
     - Connection to an IP address controlled by the attacker using SmartFTP Client for exfiltration.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing tool that is often used for post-exploitation activities, including reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - SmartFTP Client is a file transfer protocol (FTP) client that can be used to transfer files over a network.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attacker would use SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data during the third stage of the attack, after deploying Cobalt Strike.

   Let's evaluate the answer choices:
   - A: Yes: This suggests that it is likely the attacker would use SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data after deploying Cobalt Strike.
   - B: No: This suggests that it is not likely the attacker would use SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data after deploying Cobalt Strike.

   The use of Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery implies that the attacker has already established a presence within the target infrastructure. Exfiltration is typically the next step in the attack lifecycle, where the attacker would attempt to extract data from the compromised system. SmartFTP Client is a plausible tool for exfiltration, as it can be used to transfer files over the network.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The attacker has deployed Cobalt Strike, which is a post-exploitation tool.
   - Step 2: The attacker is likely to perform exfiltration after reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - Step 3: SmartFTP Client is a tool that can be used for exfiltration.
   - Step 4: Given the context of the question, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker would use SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data after deploying Cobalt Strike.

Final Answer: A: Yes
