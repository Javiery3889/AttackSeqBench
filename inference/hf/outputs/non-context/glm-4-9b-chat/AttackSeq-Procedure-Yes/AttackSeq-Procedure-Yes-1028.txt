1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon uses Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets.
   - The follow-up question asks if it is likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Gamaredon is known for its sophisticated cyber espionage activities, often targeting sensitive information.
   - The use of Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement suggests a high level of technical capability and an interest in maintaining persistence within the network.
   - Deploying scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by advanced threat actors to gather intelligence.
   - Given Gamaredon's tactics and the nature of their operations, it is plausible that they would use such scripts to further their objectives of data collection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Gamaredon is an advanced threat actor with a history of sophisticated cyber espionage.
   - Step 2: The use of Outlook VBA macros indicates a targeted approach to lateral movement within a network.
   - Step 3: Advanced threat actors often use automated tools and scripts to streamline their operations and gather information efficiently.
   - Step 4: The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon would deploy scripts to scan for sensitive documents, which is a common practice in cyber espionage.
   - Step 5: Based on the above steps, it is reasonable to conclude that the answer is likely to be "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
