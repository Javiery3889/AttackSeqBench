Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving attackers using images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems. The next step mentioned is the attackers verifying victims' credentials in real-time and subsequently prompting for the 2-step verification code.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after evading Google's security systems with images in phishing emails, the attackers will proceed to verify victims' credentials in real-time and then prompt for the 2-step verification code.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attackers will not verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for the 2-step verification code after using images in phishing emails.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of images in phishing emails is a common technique to bypass email filters that are designed to detect and block text-based phishing attempts. This is because images are less likely to be detected by email security systems.
- The next logical step in a phishing attack is to attempt to obtain the victim's credentials. Real-time credential verification is a method that attackers might use to ensure that the credentials they have obtained are valid and can be used to access the victim's account.
- Prompting for the 2-step verification code is a common tactic used by attackers to further verify the credentials they have obtained. This is because 2-step verification adds an additional layer of security that requires the victim to provide a second form of authentication, such as a code sent to their phone.

Based on the above reasoning, it is plausible that after using images in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems, attackers would verify victims' credentials in real-time and subsequently prompt for the 2-step verification code.

Final Answer: A: Yes
