1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the delivery of a malware named KerrDown through malicious Microsoft Office documents. The delivery method includes macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading. The question then asks if it's likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely for the Office document to contain an image file with instructions to enable macros, followed by the execution of a malicious payload using base64 blobs.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely for the Office document to contain an image file with such instructions.

Given the typical attack patterns associated with malware delivery, especially those that rely on macros, it is common for attackers to use social engineering techniques to trick victims into enabling macros. These techniques often include images or text that appear to be part of the document's content, but are actually designed to deceive the user into taking the desired action.

The use of base64 blobs to execute the payload is also a common technique, as base64 encoding can be used to obfuscate the actual executable code, making it harder to detect by antivirus software.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The question describes a delivery method that is known to be used in malware campaigns, specifically the use of macros in Office documents.
   - Step 2: Social engineering is a key component of such attacks, and it is plausible that an image file could be used to instruct the victim to enable macros.
   - Step 3: The use of base64 blobs to execute the payload is a common technique in malware delivery, and it is consistent with the described attack sequence.
   - Step 4: Based on the typical attack patterns and the specific details provided in the question, it is reasonable to conclude that the Office document is likely to contain an image file with instructions to enable macros before executing the payload.

Final Answer: A: Yes
