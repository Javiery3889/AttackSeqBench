Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack. The sequence includes:
  1. A phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document.
  2. The document contains a VBA macro that is set to auto-open.
  3. The VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe'.
  4. 'mshta.exe' downloads and executes a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
  5. The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is plausible.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not plausible.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a common pattern in cyber attacks. Phishing emails are often used to deliver malicious documents, which can contain macros that are designed to execute code on the victim's machine.
- The use of a VBA macro to auto-open and execute commands is a well-known technique for delivering malware.
- The use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper is a method that has been observed in various attacks, as 'mshta.exe' is a Windows component that can execute scripts and is often used by attackers to bypass security measures.
- The creation of a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL is a common persistence mechanism used by malware to ensure it runs continuously on the compromised system.

Given that each step in the sequence is a plausible TTP and that the sequence is consistent with known attack patterns, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
