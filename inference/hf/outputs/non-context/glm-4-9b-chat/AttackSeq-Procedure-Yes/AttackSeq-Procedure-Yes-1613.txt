1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group. The sequence includes the use of backdoor malware for communication and remote command execution, followed by the deployment of Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware after using the backdoor malware.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the Lazarus group used Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files after using backdoor malware.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the Lazarus group used Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files after using backdoor malware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Lazarus group is known for its involvement in cyber espionage and financial cybercrime, which often includes the use of ransomware.
   - Step 2: The use of backdoor malware is a common initial step in an attack to establish persistence and control over the target's system.
   - Step 3: After gaining control, the next logical step for a cybercriminal group is to disrupt the target's operations, which can be achieved by deleting backup files and Volume Shadow Copies.
   - Step 4: Hermes ransomware is a known ransomware variant that has been associated with the Lazarus group in the past.
   - Step 5: Given the context of the question and the known behavior of the Lazarus group, it is plausible that they would use Hermes ransomware to delete backup files and disrupt the target's operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
