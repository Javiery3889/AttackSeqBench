Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that likely occurred in an attack. The sequence includes:
  1. Insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal.
  2. The malicious JavaScript code redirects victims to an exploit landing page.
  3. The exploit landing page exploits CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
  4. Heap spraying techniques are used to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute an embedded shellcode payload.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the sequence of events described in the question is plausible.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the sequence of events described in the question is not plausible.

To evaluate the plausibility of the sequence, we need to consider the typical progression of an attack that involves a web-based exploit and then leverages more advanced techniques like heap spraying.

- The first step of inserting malicious JavaScript code into a news portal is a common initial step in web-based attacks, as it allows attackers to reach a broad audience.
- Redirecting victims to an exploit landing page is a typical next step, as it is a way to deliver the exploit payload to the victim's browser.
- Exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome is a plausible step, as it is a known vulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
- Heap spraying is a more advanced technique that is often used after a vulnerability has been exploited to bypass security measures and execute code. It is not typically the first step in an attack, but it can be used in a multi-step attack to achieve persistence or to evade detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question is plausible, as it starts with a common initial step (malicious JavaScript code insertion) and progresses to more advanced techniques (exploiting a vulnerability and heap spraying).
- The sequence does not seem to be out of order or illogical in terms of how an attacker might proceed after successfully exploiting a vulnerability.

Final Answer: A: Yes
