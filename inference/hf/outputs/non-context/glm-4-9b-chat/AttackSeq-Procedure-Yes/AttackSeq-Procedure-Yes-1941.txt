Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where Smooth Operator malware has established communication with its Command and Control (C2) servers over HTTPS and uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The question implies that the malware has already established a secure connection to its C2 server and has a method of obfuscating data.
- The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. Establishing communication with C2 servers over HTTPS
  2. Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation
  3. Exfiltrating data via a second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that the malware will automatically exfiltrate data using a HTTP GET request. This is plausible because the malware has already established a secure connection and has a method to obfuscate data, which could be used to send data without detection.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that the malware will not automatically exfiltrate data using a HTTP GET request. This could be plausible if the malware's design does not include an automated exfiltration mechanism or if the exfiltration method is different from a HTTP GET request.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has successfully established a secure connection to its C2 server, which is a critical step for exfiltration.
- The use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation suggests that the malware is designed to avoid detection during data transmission.
- Given these two steps, it is reasonable to assume that the malware is designed to exfiltrate data in a stealthy manner.
- A HTTP GET request is a common method for exfiltration because it is less likely to trigger security alerts compared to other methods like POST requests.

Final Answer: A: Yes
