Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where attackers use a compromised software update (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise) as their initial access vector.
- The question also asks if it is likely that the attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts to acquire infrastructure.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that the attackers would park domains before using a compromised software update.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that the attackers would park domains before using a compromised software update.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- In the context of cyber attacks, attackers often engage in Resource Development before executing their main attack. This can include acquiring infrastructure, such as domains, to support their operations.
- Parking domains is a common step in Resource Development as it allows attackers to reserve domain names that could be used for various malicious activities, including phishing, command and control (C2), or to host malicious payloads.
- Given that the attackers are using a compromised software update as their initial access vector, it is plausible that they would have already established the necessary infrastructure, including parked domains, to support their attack.
- Therefore, it is likely that the attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
