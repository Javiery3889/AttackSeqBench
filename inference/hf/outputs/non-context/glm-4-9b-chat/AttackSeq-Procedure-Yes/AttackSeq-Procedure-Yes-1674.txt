1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will use the SocGholish framework for initial compromise via compromised legitimate websites, followed by using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial compromise using the SocGholish framework.
     2. Remote system discovery using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that it is likely that the attackers will use SocGholish for initial compromise and then Get-NetComputer for remote system discovery.
     - SocGholish is a malicious browser extension that can be used to redirect users to malicious websites, which is a common initial step in many attack sequences.
     - Get-NetComputer is a PowerShell command that can be used to enumerate network resources, which is a typical step after initial access to understand the environment.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that it is not likely that the attackers will use SocGholish for initial compromise and then Get-NetComputer for remote system discovery.
     - This could be less likely if the attackers were using a different initial access vector or if they were not interested in remote system discovery.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: SocGholish is a known tool used by attackers to compromise users by redirecting them to malicious websites, which is a plausible initial step in an attack.
   - Step 2: After gaining initial access, attackers often look to enumerate and understand the network environment, which is what Get-NetComputer is designed to do.
   - Step 3: Given that both TTPs are commonly used in cyber attacks, it is reasonable to assume that they could be used in sequence as described.
   - Step 4: Therefore, the sequence of using SocGholish for initial compromise followed by Get-NetComputer for remote system discovery is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
