Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker, CosmicDuke, is searching removable drives for files and skipping certain file types during the discovery phase.
- The question then asks if it is likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types.
  2. Using a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.
  3. Exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that it is likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer after searching for files on removable drives.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that it is not likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer after searching for files on removable drives.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- CosmicDuke is known to be a sophisticated threat actor that has been observed using a variety of techniques to steal information.
- The first TTP mentioned is searching removable drives for files, which is a common method for data exfiltration.
- The second TTP, using a clipboard stealer, is a method that can be used to collect additional information that may not be stored on the removable drives but could be copied to the clipboard by the user.
- The third TTP, exfiltrating the collected information via FTP, is a common method for transferring data to remote servers.

Given that CosmicDuke is known to be a sophisticated actor and the sequence of TTPs described is a plausible progression of actions, it is reasonable to conclude that CosmicDuke could use a clipboard stealer to collect additional data before exfiltrating it.

Final Answer: A: Yes
