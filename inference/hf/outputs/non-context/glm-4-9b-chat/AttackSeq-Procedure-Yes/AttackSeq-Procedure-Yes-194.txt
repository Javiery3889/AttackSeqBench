Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) as follows:
  1. Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.
  2. Running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor for Execution.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server using an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that SparrowDoor will not communicate with the C&C server using an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

SparrowDoor is a known malware that is designed to provide remote access to an infected system. It is common for modern malware to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server using encrypted channels to evade detection and ensure secure communication. HTTPS is a common protocol used for such encrypted communication.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The initial access is gained by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities, which is a common method for attackers to gain a foothold in a target network.
- Step 2: The attacker uses cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor, which is a malware designed for persistent access and control over the infected system.
- Step 3: Given that SparrowDoor is designed for persistent access, it is likely to communicate with its C&C server to receive commands and updates.
- Step 4: It is common for malware to use encrypted channels for C&C communication to avoid detection by security systems.
- Step 5: HTTPS is a standard encrypted communication protocol used by many malware for C&C communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
