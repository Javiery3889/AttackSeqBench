Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where GreyEnergy, a known cyber threat actor, has used a modular malware framework to develop functionality on targeted systems.
- The question asks whether GreyEnergy is likely to proceed to secure access to ICS (Industrial Control Systems) control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that GreyEnergy would indeed proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for information gathering.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that GreyEnergy would not proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for information gathering.

Given that GreyEnergy is known for its targeted and sophisticated attacks on ICS systems, it is plausible that they would continue their reconnaissance efforts by securing access to ICS control workstations and servers. This is because such systems often contain valuable information that can be used to understand the broader network environment and potentially exploit vulnerabilities for further access or control.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: GreyEnergy is known for its targeted attacks on ICS systems.
- Step 2: The use of a modular malware framework indicates a level of sophistication and adaptability.
- Step 3: Reconnaissance is a critical phase in cyber attacks to gather information about the target environment.
- Step 4: Access to ICS control workstations and servers would provide GreyEnergy with valuable information about the target's industrial processes and potential vulnerabilities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
