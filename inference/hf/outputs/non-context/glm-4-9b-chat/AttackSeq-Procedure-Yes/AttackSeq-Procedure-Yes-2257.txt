1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with an Initial Access phase where a phishing email is used to deliver a malicious file named COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip.
   - The question then asks if the attack is likely to proceed with the following steps:
     a. Execute a PowerShell script from the Internet.
     b. Run the script at memory level.
     c. Ensure persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that the attack will proceed with the described steps. It is plausible that after delivering the malicious file, the attacker would use it to execute a PowerShell script, which could then be designed to run at memory level for stealth. Finally, the attacker would ensure persistence by creating startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that the attack will not proceed with the described steps. This could be the case if the attacker's goal is to achieve persistence in a different manner or if the script does not have the capability to run at memory level or create persistence mechanisms.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Initial Access phase involves delivering a malicious file via phishing, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - The next plausible step is to execute a PowerShell script, as PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate tasks and is often used by attackers for its stealth capabilities.
   - Running the script at memory level is a common technique to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software, which may not scan memory.
   - Ensuring persistence is a critical part of a successful attack, and creating startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks are common methods to achieve this.
   - Given the context of the question and the typical progression of an attack, it is likely that the attacker would proceed with the described steps.

Final Answer: A: Yes
