Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the T9000 malware.
- The sequence includes:
  1. Initial access through exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
  2. Sideload of the malicious DLL hccutils.dll using igfxtray.exe.
  3. Subsequent execution of hccutils.dll.
  4. Achieving persistence by modifying registry keys or injecting the ResN32.dll library into explorer.exe.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the T9000 malware will follow the described sequence of TTPs.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the T9000 malware will not follow the described sequence of TTPs.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The T9000 malware is known for its sophisticated behavior, which often includes a multi-step infection process.
- The initial access through CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 is a common method for malware to exploit vulnerabilities in RTF files.
- Sideload of a malicious DLL using a legitimate system process like igfxtray.exe is a technique that can bypass some security measures.
- The subsequent execution of the malicious DLL is a typical step in the malware lifecycle.
- Achieving persistence is a critical step for malware to maintain a presence on the compromised system, and modifying registry keys or injecting code into explorer.exe are common persistence mechanisms.

Given that the described sequence of TTPs is a plausible and common progression for malware like T9000, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
