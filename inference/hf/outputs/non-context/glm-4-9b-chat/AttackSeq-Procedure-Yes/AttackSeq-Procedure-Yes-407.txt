Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a malicious Excel file was attached to a delivery email.
- The Excel file is said to contain a macro that displays a fake invoice.
- The macro also runs malicious code in the background to install ISMAgent.
- The actors are associated with the OilRig campaign, who sent phishing emails to targeted individuals.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the Excel file contained the described TTPs.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the Excel file contained the described TTPs.

Given the information provided in the question, we can evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice:

- The scenario described aligns with common tactics used in targeted attacks, such as those associated with the OilRig campaign. These campaigns often use phishing emails to deliver malicious attachments, which can include macros that execute additional code.
- The use of a macro to display a fake invoice is a plausible social engineering technique to trick the recipient into enabling the macro.
- The installation of ISMAgent in the background is consistent with the behavior of malware designed to remain undetected on a system.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario described is consistent with known attack patterns used by threat actors, such as those associated with the OilRig campaign.
- The use of a macro to display a fake invoice and execute additional code to install malware is a plausible sequence of TTPs.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the malicious Excel file likely contained the described TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
