Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a threat actor, Agrius, is likely to use in an attack. The sequence includes:
  1. Exploiting public-facing applications for initial access.
  2. Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).
  3. Deploying custom malware, such as the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, for execution.
  4. Achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service and deploying webshells on compromised systems.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that Agrius will deploy custom malware and achieve persistence as described.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that Agrius will deploy custom malware and achieve persistence as described.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question follows a typical pattern of an attack lifecycle, starting with initial access, moving to lateral movement, and then establishing persistence on the compromised network.
- The use of custom malware, such as the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, is a common technique for achieving persistence and maintaining a presence on a compromised system. This is because custom malware can be designed to evade detection and provide the attacker with ongoing access.
- Registering the malware as a service is a well-known method for ensuring that the malware runs continuously, even after a system restart.
- Deploying webshells on compromised systems is a common method for maintaining access to the network and for further exploitation.

Given the typical behavior of threat actors like Agrius and the logical progression of the attack sequence, it is reasonable to conclude that they would deploy custom malware and achieve persistence as described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
