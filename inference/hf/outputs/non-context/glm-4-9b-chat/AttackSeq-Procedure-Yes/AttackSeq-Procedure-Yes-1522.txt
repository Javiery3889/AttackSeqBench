1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have modified a JavaScript file on the Afghan Government's CDN server to deliver malicious code to targeted websites.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     - Modifying a JavaScript file on a CDN server.
     - Delivering malicious code to targeted websites.
     - Obfuscating the malicious code by appending it to the existing file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the attackers did obfuscate the malicious code by appending it to the existing file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attackers did not obfuscate the malicious code in the described manner.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The question states that the attackers modified the JavaScript file to deliver malicious code. This is a typical TTP (Tactic: Delivery and Technique: Web Shell).
   - Step 2: The question also mentions that the malicious code is delivered to targeted websites. This is consistent with the TTP of delivering malicious content to a specific audience.
   - Step 3: The question specifically asks if the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer. Obfuscation is a common technique used in cyber attacks to make the malicious code harder to detect.
   - Step 4: Dean Edwards Packer is a known JavaScript obfuscator, which is consistent with the TTP of Obfuscation.
   - Step 5: Given that the question describes the method of obfuscation, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would have used a method to evade detection, which includes obfuscation.

Final Answer: A: Yes
