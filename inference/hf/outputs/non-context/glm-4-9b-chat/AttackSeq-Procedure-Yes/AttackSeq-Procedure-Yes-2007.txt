1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where adversaries have successfully delivered the BlackEnergy 3 Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to target systems through a phishing campaign.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution to enable further malicious activities.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     a. Phishing campaign to deliver BlackEnergy 3 RAT
     b. Establishing a C2 connection through malicious VBA script execution
   - Phishing campaigns are a common initial attack vector for delivering malware, such as the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.
   - Once the RAT is installed on the target system, the adversaries typically need to maintain control over the compromised system to conduct further malicious activities.
   - Establishing a C2 connection is a common step in the post-infection phase of an attack, as it allows the adversaries to communicate with the compromised system and issue commands.
   - Malicious VBA scripts are often used to execute code on a system without the need for additional software installations, which can be a stealthy method for establishing a C2 connection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial delivery of the BlackEnergy 3 RAT is a well-documented TTP, especially in the context of phishing campaigns.
   - Step 2: After delivering the RAT, adversaries would likely seek to maintain control over the compromised systems, which is why establishing a C2 connection is a plausible next step.
   - Step 3: Using a malicious VBA script to establish the C2 connection is a plausible method, as it can be used to execute code silently and without raising suspicion.
   - Step 4: Given the context of the question and the typical behavior of adversaries after deploying a RAT, it is reasonable to assume that they would attempt to establish a C2 connection to continue their malicious activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
