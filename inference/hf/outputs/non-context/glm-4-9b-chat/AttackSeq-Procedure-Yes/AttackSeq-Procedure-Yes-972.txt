1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the use of the Aria-body backdoor.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Discovery, followed by Collection.
   - The Aria-body backdoor is known to gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the Discovery phase, the Aria-body backdoor will proceed to create/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Aria-body backdoor will not proceed to create/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Aria-body backdoor is designed to perform various malicious activities, which typically include both Discovery and Collection phases.
   - The Discovery phase is focused on gathering information about the system and environment, which is consistent with the TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The Collection phase, as the name implies, is where the attacker collects data from the compromised system.
   - It is common for a backdoor to proceed from Discovery to Collection, as the initial information gathered is used to identify targets for data collection.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that after the Discovery phase, the Aria-body backdoor would proceed to create/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
