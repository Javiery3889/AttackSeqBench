Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving an attacker evading defenses by operating in memory, using a specific DCOM object to execute files, and then a PowerShell script potentially communicating with Command and Control (C2) servers to download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab.

Given the context of the question, the sequence of TTPs described is as follows:
1. Evading defenses by operating in memory.
2. Using the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute files without saving them to disk.
3. A PowerShell script communicating with C2 servers to download payloads.

The use of a PowerShell script is a common method for attackers to interact with systems and execute commands. It is also a common vector for downloading payloads from C2 servers. Ursnif and GandCrab are well-known malware families that often use C2 communication to download additional payloads or to receive commands.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The attacker has already evaded defenses, which suggests a high level of sophistication.
- Step 2: The use of a DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk is a technique often used by advanced malware to avoid detection.
- Step 3: Given the context of the question, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker would continue to use sophisticated methods, such as a PowerShell script, to communicate with C2 servers and download payloads.
- Step 4: Ursnif and GandCrab are known to use C2 communication for their operations, which further supports the likelihood of the PowerShell script communicating with C2 servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
