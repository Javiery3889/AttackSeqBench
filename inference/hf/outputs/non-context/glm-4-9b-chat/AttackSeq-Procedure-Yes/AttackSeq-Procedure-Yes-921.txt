Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where attackers first scan for and exploit vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers to gain initial access.
- The next step in the sequence is to use the infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network.
- The final step mentioned is the employment of an Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers will use the infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network and then use an Explosive Trojan to infect USB devices for lateral movement.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attackers will not use the infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network and will not use an Explosive Trojan to infect USB devices for lateral movement.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access through web servers is a common method for attackers to gain a foothold in a network.
- Using the infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network is a plausible step, as it allows attackers to move laterally within the network without being detected as easily.
- The use of an Explosive Trojan to infect USB devices for lateral movement is also a plausible step, as USB devices are often used to transfer data and can be a vector for spreading malware within a network.
- The sequence described in the question is a logical progression of steps that attackers might take to achieve their goals.

Final Answer: A: Yes
