1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker gains initial access using malicious RTF and Excel files that exploit known vulnerabilities.
   - The sequence then mentions the execution of malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, followed by the use of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) such as DarkComet and Bozok.
   - Finally, the question asks if it is likely that the attacker will employ techniques to evade defense measures, specifically WHOIS protection for infrastructure.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the initial exploitation, the attacker will proceed with the mentioned TTPs (Trojans and RATs) and then use WHOIS protection to evade detection.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attacker will not use the mentioned TTPs or the WHOIS protection technique.

Given the typical progression of an attack, it is plausible that after gaining initial access, an attacker would proceed to execute malicious code using Trojans and RATs. These tools are commonly used to maintain persistence on a compromised system and to control the victim's machine remotely. Additionally, using WHOIS protection to mask the attacker's infrastructure is a common technique to evade detection and attribution.

3. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The attacker gains initial access using RTF and Excel files with known vulnerabilities.
   - Step 2: The attacker executes malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.
   - Step 3: The attacker uses RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - Step 4: The attacker employs WHOIS protection for infrastructure to evade defense measures.

Final Answer: A: Yes
