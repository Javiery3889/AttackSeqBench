1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with initial access through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - The sequence continues with the dropping of an embedded downloader file.
   - The next step in the sequence is the execution of MSIL/Crimson malware on the victim's machine.
   - The final step mentioned is the malware attempting to download the full Remote Access Trojan (RAT) component from a specific IP address and port before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute and attempt to download the RAT component before establishing command and control.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the MSIL/Crimson malware will not attempt to download the RAT component before establishing command and control.

Given the typical behavior of malware, it is common for the malware to establish command and control first before executing additional stages of the attack. This is because establishing command and control allows the attacker to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system, which is necessary for deploying additional payloads or conducting further actions.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Initial access is gained using a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) in weaponized RTF documents.
   - Step 2: An embedded downloader file is dropped, which is a common method for delivering the main payload.
   - Step 3: The MSIL/Crimson malware executes on the victim's machine. This is a typical action after a downloader has been executed.
   - Step 4: The malware attempts to download the full RAT component. This is a common step in the malware lifecycle, as the RAT is often the main payload that provides the attacker with remote access to the system.
   - Step 5: The malware establishes command and control. This is usually the last step, as it allows the attacker to maintain control over the compromised system.

Based on the typical attack sequence, it is more plausible that the malware would establish command and control before attempting to download the full RAT component.

Final Answer: B: No
