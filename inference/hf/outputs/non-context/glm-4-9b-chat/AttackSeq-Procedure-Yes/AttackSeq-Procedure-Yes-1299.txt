1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an Excel document is used to execute hidden objects, exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attack will hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) T1158 refers to the technique of hiding files and directories to avoid detection.
   - After executing a payload that could be used to extract credentials, it is common for an attacker to attempt to cover their tracks to avoid detection by security tools and analysts.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question is as follows:
     1. Execute hidden objects in an Excel document.
     2. Exploit CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
     3. Hide artifacts (T1158).
     4. Search for and extract credentials.
   - Given that the attacker has already executed a payload and exploited a vulnerability, it is plausible that they would want to hide their presence on the system to avoid detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The attacker has already executed a payload, which suggests they are in the system and likely attempting to maintain persistence.
   - Step 2: The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 is a means to achieve persistence and potentially elevate privileges or access sensitive information.
   - Step 3: To avoid detection, the attacker would likely employ T1158 to hide any files or directories related to the attack, which could include the payload, logs, or other artifacts.
   - Step 4: After hiding the artifacts, the attacker would then proceed to search for and extract credentials, as this is a common goal of many attacks.

Final Answer: A: Yes
