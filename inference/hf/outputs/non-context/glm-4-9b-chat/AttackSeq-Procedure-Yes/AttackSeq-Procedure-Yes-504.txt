1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor has performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor would communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework typically involves gathering information about the target environment to understand the attack surface and potential targets.
   - Protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP are common methods used by malware to communicate with C2 servers because they can bypass traditional network defenses and are less likely to be detected.
   - Given that SombRAT is a backdoor, it is designed to maintain persistence and communicate with its C2 servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
   - It is plausible that SombRAT would use such methods to communicate with C2 servers, as they are consistent with the behavior of malware that needs to remain undetected.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The backdoor has completed the Discovery phase, which involves gathering information about the target environment.
   - Step 2: Protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP are common and effective methods for malware to communicate with C2 servers without being detected.
   - Step 3: SombRAT is a backdoor designed to maintain persistence and communicate with C2 servers.
   - Step 4: Combining the above points, it is reasonable to assume that SombRAT would use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to communicate with C2 servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
