Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that include:
  1. Discovering and mapping the organization's internal network using the Cobalt Strike beacon.
  2. Collecting administrative-level credentials.
  3. Moving laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the initial steps, the attackers will continue to move laterally within the network.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attackers will not move laterally after the initial steps.

Given the context of the question, the use of Cobalt Strike, and the collection of administrative-level credentials, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers have a high level of access and intent to compromise more systems within the network. Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing tool that is often used by attackers to establish a beachhead within a network. Collecting administrative-level credentials further enhances their ability to move laterally and control more systems.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The attackers have successfully discovered and mapped the internal network, which is a significant step in a lateral movement attack.
- Step 2: They have collected administrative-level credentials, which typically provide them with the highest level of access to the network.
- Step 3: With such access, it is highly plausible that the attackers will attempt to move laterally to compromise more systems, as this is a common TTP in cyber attacks to expand their control over the target environment.

Final Answer: A: Yes
