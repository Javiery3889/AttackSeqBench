1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are part of a cyber attack. The sequence mentioned is as follows:
     - Collection phase: Using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
     - Exfiltration phase: Automatically uploading the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contacting live remote sites.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contacting live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.
     - CosmicDuke is a known advanced persistent threat (APT) that is known to use various methods for data exfiltration, including using stored credentials for FTP transfers. This aligns with the TTPs described in the question.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contacting live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.
     - This contradicts the known behavior of CosmicDuke, which is known to use stored credentials for exfiltration.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the TTPs in the question and match them with the known behavior of CosmicDuke.
   - Step 2: Recognize that CosmicDuke is known to use stored credentials for exfiltration, which includes FTP transfers.
   - Step 3: Determine that the TTPs described in the question are consistent with CosmicDuke's known behavior.

Final Answer: A: Yes
