Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.
- It then mentions the execution of a dropper to enable system compromise.
- The question asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during its discovery process.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- APT28, also known as Fancy Bear or Sofacy, is a known advanced persistent threat group that has been associated with various cyber espionage campaigns.
- APT28 is known for its use of sophisticated techniques, including spear phishing, droppers, and command and control (C2) infrastructure.
- Geographically distributed bots are a common method used by APT groups to maintain persistence and evade detection, as they can be harder to trace and disrupt.
- Reporting back to a central server is a typical behavior for APT groups, as it allows for centralized command and control and data exfiltration.

Given the information about APT28's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), it is plausible that they would use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process. This is because such a method aligns with their known behavior of evading detection and maintaining a persistent presence on compromised systems.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- APT28 is known for using spear phishing to gain initial access, which is consistent with the question's description.
- The execution of a dropper is also a known TTP of APT28, which is used to install malware on the compromised system.
- The use of geographically distributed bots for reporting back to a central server is a common and effective method for maintaining persistence and evading detection, which is consistent with APT28's tactics.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that APT28 would use this method during the discovery process.

Final Answer: A: Yes
