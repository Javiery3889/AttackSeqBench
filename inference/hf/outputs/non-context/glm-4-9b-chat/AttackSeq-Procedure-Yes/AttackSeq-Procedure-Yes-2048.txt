1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving Charming Kitten, who created fake websites to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Resource Development phase is typically used to gather the necessary tools, resources, and information to carry out an attack. In this case, Charming Kitten has already created fake websites, which suggests they have the capability and intent to deceive users.
   - The Reconnaissance phase is where an attacker gathers information about the target to understand their environment, identify potential vulnerabilities, and plan the attack. Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists could be a method to gather information or to gain trust and access to sensitive data.
   - Given that Charming Kitten has already shown a sophisticated approach by creating fake websites, it is plausible that they would continue to use sophisticated methods in the Reconnaissance phase. Impersonating well-known individuals could be a plausible TTP for this phase, especially if the goal is to gather information or credentials from non-Iranian researchers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Charming Kitten has shown a sophisticated approach by creating fake websites, indicating a level of planning and resourcefulness.
   - Step 2: The Reconnaissance phase is about gathering information and planning the attack, which could involve impersonating individuals to gain trust or access.
   - Step 3: Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists is a plausible TTP for the Reconnaissance phase, especially if the target is non-Iranian researchers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
