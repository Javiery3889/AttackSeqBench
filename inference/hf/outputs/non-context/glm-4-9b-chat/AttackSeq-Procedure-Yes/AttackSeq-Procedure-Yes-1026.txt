Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the insertion of malicious macros into documents, using a backdoor to list interesting files, and then asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.

Gamaredon's malware is known for its targeted nature and its focus on espionage. It is designed to steal sensitive information from its victims. Given this, it is plausible that the malware would attempt to collect as much data as possible. The initial steps of inserting malicious macros and using a backdoor to list interesting files indicate a discovery phase, which is often followed by data collection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial insertion of malicious macros suggests that the attackers are looking to establish persistence on the system.
- The use of a backdoor to list interesting files such as Office documents indicates that the attackers are interested in specific types of data.
- Given the nature of espionage malware like Gamaredon, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would want to collect as much sensitive data as possible.
- Scanning all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data is a plausible step in the data collection phase, as it would allow the attackers to gather a comprehensive set of data from the compromised system and potentially from other systems on the network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
