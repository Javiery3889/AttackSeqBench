Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack scenario involving the threat actor Grandoreiro.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
  1. Collecting information about the victim's computer.
  2. Information collected includes operating system details and installed security products.
  3. Employing tricks such as API hooking and detection of virtual environments to evade detection and emulation.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer after using the mentioned tricks.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer after using the mentioned tricks.

Given that Grandoreiro is known for its sophisticated tactics, including evading detection and emulation, it is reasonable to assume that the actor would collect detailed information about the target environment to understand the defenses in place and tailor their attack accordingly. Collecting information about the operating system and installed security products is a common step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack, as it helps the attacker to understand the potential vulnerabilities and defenses they may encounter.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: Recognize that Grandoreiro is a sophisticated threat actor.
- Step 2: Understand that sophisticated actors often perform reconnaissance to gather information about the target environment.
- Step 3: Note that the question specifies that Grandoreiro uses API hooking and detection of virtual environments, which are techniques used to evade detection and emulation.
- Step 4: Conclude that after evading detection, it is plausible that Grandoreiro would collect detailed information about the victim's computer to understand the defenses.

Final Answer: A: Yes
