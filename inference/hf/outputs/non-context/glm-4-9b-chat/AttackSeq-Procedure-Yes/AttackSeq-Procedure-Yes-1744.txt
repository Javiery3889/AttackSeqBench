Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker (TG1021) has used a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the attacker demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The Potato family tools are known for their ability to escalate privileges on a compromised system.
- Privilege escalation is a common technique used by attackers to gain higher levels of access on a system.
- After achieving a higher level of access, it is common for attackers to attempt to avoid detection by cleaning up their tracks, which can include removing disk-resident tools.
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the attacker would remove all disk-resident tools to avoid detection.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the attacker would remove all disk-resident tools to avoid detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The attacker has already escalated privileges, which is a significant step in an attack.
- Step 2: After achieving privileges, the next logical step for an attacker is to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
- Step 3: Removing disk-resident tools is a common method to avoid detection, as it reduces the likelihood of the attacker's presence being discovered.
- Step 4: Given the typical behavior of attackers to avoid detection, it is reasonable to assume that TG1021 would take steps to remove tools that could be used to trace back to them.

Final Answer: A: Yes
