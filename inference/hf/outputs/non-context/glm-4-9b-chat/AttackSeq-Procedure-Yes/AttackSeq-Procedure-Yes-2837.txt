Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where malware has discovered system information and process lists using the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control (C2) operations.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command is a command-line operation that lists the currently running processes and system information. This is a typical action performed by malware to gather information about the compromised system.
- HTTPS communication is a secure protocol that encrypts data in transit, making it a common choice for C2 operations to avoid detection and to ensure the confidentiality of the communication.
- Given that the malware has already demonstrated the ability to execute commands and gather system information, it is plausible that it would use HTTPS for C2 operations to maintain its stealth and security.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has shown the capability to interact with the system and gather information, which suggests it is actively looking to establish a connection for further actions.
- Using HTTPS for C2 operations is a common practice to ensure the communication is secure and to avoid detection by security tools.
- Therefore, it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its C2 operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
