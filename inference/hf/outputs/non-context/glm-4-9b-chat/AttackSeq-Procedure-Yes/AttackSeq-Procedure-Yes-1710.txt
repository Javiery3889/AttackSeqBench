Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where Turla, a known cyber espionage actor, uses an encrypted file system for defense evasion.
- The follow-up question asks whether it is likely that Turla would include document stealers in its specialized tools for collecting data from information repositories.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The use of an encrypted file system for defense evasion suggests that Turla is sophisticated and has a high level of operational security.
- Given this level of sophistication, it is reasonable to assume that Turla would employ a variety of tools to maximize its data collection capabilities.
- Document stealers are a type of malware designed to steal documents from a victim's system, which is a common objective for espionage actors like Turla.
- Therefore, it is plausible that Turla would include document stealers in its arsenal to collect data from information repositories.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Turla's use of an encrypted file system indicates a high level of operational security.
- A high level of operational security often correlates with a diverse set of tools to achieve various objectives.
- Document stealers are a common tool for collecting data, which aligns with Turla's objectives.
- Therefore, it is likely that Turla would include document stealers in its specialized tools.

Final Answer: A: Yes
