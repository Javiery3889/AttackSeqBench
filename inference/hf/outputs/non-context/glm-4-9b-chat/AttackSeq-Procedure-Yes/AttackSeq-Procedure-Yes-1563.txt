1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has compromised SolarWinds and delivered the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack for initial access.
   - The question asks whether the Sunburst backdoor is likely to communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using a protocol for further exploitation.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the Sunburst backdoor is designed to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Sunburst backdoor does not communicate with its C2 server after the initial compromise.

Given that the Sunburst backdoor is a sophisticated malware that was used in a significant cyber attack, it is highly likely that it is designed to communicate with its C2 server for further exploitation. This communication is a common characteristic of malware used in targeted attacks, as it allows the attackers to maintain persistence on the compromised system and to execute additional malicious activities.

3. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Sunburst backdoor is a known piece of malware that was used in a supply-chain attack.
   - Step 2: Malware typically communicates with its C2 server to receive commands and to exfiltrate data.
   - Step 3: Given the nature of the Sunburst backdoor and the typical behavior of such malware, it is reasonable to assume that it would communicate with its C2 server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
