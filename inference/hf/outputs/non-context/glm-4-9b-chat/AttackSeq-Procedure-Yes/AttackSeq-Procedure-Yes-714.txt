Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where initial access is achieved by injecting the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word through a malicious macro.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: 
  1. Initial access through a malicious macro in Word.
  2. Injection of the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory.
  3. The Rising Sun implant downloading a second-stage payload.
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question implies that the Rising Sun implant is a component that could be used to download additional payloads after initial access is achieved.
- The term "implant" typically refers to a piece of software that is designed to perform specific actions on a compromised system, which could include downloading additional payloads.
- Given that the Sharpshooter downloader has already been successfully injected into the memory, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant would be used to download a second-stage payload to further the attacker's objectives.
- Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the Rising Sun implant would likely download a second-stage payload.

Final Answer: A: Yes
