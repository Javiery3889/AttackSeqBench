1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that likely occur in a cyber attack. The sequence includes reconnaissance activities, followed by the installation of a malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) on the network, and finally, the implant establishing communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Installation of malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3)
     3. Communication with C2 servers

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that after the reconnaissance activities and installation of the malicious implant, it is likely that the implant will establish communication with C2 servers.
     - BlackEnergy 3 is known to be a malware that has been used in targeted attacks, and it is designed to communicate with C2 servers to receive instructions and exfiltrate data.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that after the reconnaissance activities and installation of the malicious implant, it is not likely that the implant will establish communication with C2 servers.
     - This is less plausible given the nature of BlackEnergy 3, which is designed to communicate with C2 servers as part of its functionality.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Reconnaissance activities are a common initial step in cyber attacks to gather information about the target environment.
   - Step 2: The installation of a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3 is a typical technique used to compromise a system and gain persistence on the network.
   - Step 3: Given that BlackEnergy 3 is designed to communicate with C2 servers, it is a logical next step in the attack sequence for the implant to establish such communication.
   - Conclusion: Based on the nature of BlackEnergy 3 and the typical progression of a cyber attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the implant would establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.

Final Answer: A: Yes
