Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Darkhotel APT has compromised trusted commercial network resources on a global scale.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will use small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code before employing techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The Darkhotel APT is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, often using zero-day exploits and small downloaders to deliver payloads.
- The use of small downloaders is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) for delivering malware in a stealthy manner, as they are designed to be compact and less likely to trigger security measures.
- Zero-day exploits are vulnerabilities that are unknown to the vendor and thus have no available patches or mitigations, making them highly effective for bypassing defenses.
- Signing backdoors with digital certificates is a technique used to evade detection by making the malicious code appear legitimate, which is also a known TTP of the Darkhotel APT.

Given the information about the Darkhotel APT's tactics, it is plausible that they would use small downloaders and zero-day exploits to deliver their payload before using digital certificate signing for defense evasion.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Darkhotel APT is known for its use of sophisticated malware delivery methods, including small downloaders and zero-day exploits.
- These methods are effective for bypassing security measures and delivering the payload to the compromised network.
- The use of digital certificates for backdoors is a technique that the Darkhotel APT has been observed employing to evade detection.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of the Darkhotel APT.

Final Answer: A: Yes
