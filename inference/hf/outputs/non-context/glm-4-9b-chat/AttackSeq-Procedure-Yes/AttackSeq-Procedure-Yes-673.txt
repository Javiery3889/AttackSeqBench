1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) has established DNS Command and Control (C2) communication by using obfuscated data in unique DNS queries.
   - The question then asks whether the CopyKittens group is likely to perform data exfiltration over the DNS protocol as part of their attack sequence.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CopyKittens group is known for using DNS tunneling for both command and control and data exfiltration. This is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by the group.
   - Given that the RAT has already established DNS C2 communication, it is plausible that the CopyKittens group would use the same channel for data exfiltration to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CopyKittens group is known to use DNS tunneling for data exfiltration.
   - Step 2: The RAT has already established DNS C2 communication, which is a channel that can be used for data exfiltration.
   - Step 3: There is no information in the question that suggests the CopyKittens group would not use the same channel for data exfiltration.
   - Step 4: Therefore, it is likely that the CopyKittens group would perform data exfiltration over the DNS protocol.

Final Answer: A: Yes
