1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where Elise malware has collected system information for discovery purposes.
   - The malware is then likely to communicate with a hardcoded C2 (Command and Control) server at the IP address 103.236.150[.]14.
   - The question asks whether this communication is likely to be done using an application layer protocol.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The typical behavior of malware involves collecting information about the system it has infected and then communicating with a C2 server to receive further instructions or to send the collected information.
   - Application layer protocols are commonly used for C2 communication because they provide a higher level of interaction and can be more flexible in terms of the data being exchanged.
   - Common application layer protocols used for C2 include HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, DNS, and others.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Malware often communicates with C2 servers to maintain persistence and receive commands.
   - Step 2: Application layer protocols are the standard for such communications due to their flexibility and ability to handle various types of data.
   - Step 3: Given that Elise malware has already collected system information, it is likely to use a protocol that can handle the transmission of this data.
   - Step 4: The hardcoded IP address provided is a specific endpoint that the malware is expected to communicate with.

Final Answer: A: Yes
