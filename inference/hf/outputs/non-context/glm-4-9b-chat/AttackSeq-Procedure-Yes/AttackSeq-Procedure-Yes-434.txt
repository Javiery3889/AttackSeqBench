Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where a Delphi downloader is used to gain execution. This downloader uses Windows API to execute commands and sends system information to a Command and Control (C&C) server.
- The follow-up question asks whether the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader will perform process discovery by gathering process lists from the victim's machine.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The Sednit group is known for using a variety of tools and techniques in their attacks, including downloaders like AutoIt.
- Process discovery is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by attackers to enumerate running processes on a target system. This can help them identify which services or applications are active and potentially vulnerable to exploitation.
- Given that the Sednit group is likely to use a sequence of TTPs to achieve their objectives, it is plausible that they would perform process discovery after gaining execution to understand the environment better.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Sednit group's AutoIt downloader is a likely follow-up to the Delphi downloader, as it is a common practice for attackers to use multiple tools in their attack chain.
- Process discovery is a standard step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack, which is often used to gather information about the target system.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader would perform process discovery after gaining execution.

Final Answer: A: Yes
