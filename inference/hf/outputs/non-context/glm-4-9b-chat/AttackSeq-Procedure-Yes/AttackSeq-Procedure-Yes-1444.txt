1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where Taidoor malware has evaded detection by using a downloader that decrypts a modified version of the malware.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the new Taidoor variant will communicate with specific command-and-control (C2) servers: roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: 
     1. Taidoor malware evades detection.
     2. The malware uses a downloader to decrypt a modified version of itself.
     3. The question asks if the new variant will communicate with specific C2 servers.
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the given C2 servers.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the given C2 servers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Taidoor malware is known to use downloader components to decrypt and execute its payload. This is a common TTP for malware to avoid detection and persistence on a system.
   - Step 2: The fact that the malware has evaded detection and used a downloader to decrypt a modified version suggests that the attackers are attempting to maintain their presence on the compromised system and possibly exfiltrate data or receive further instructions.
   - Step 3: Command-and-control servers are a common method for malware to communicate with its operators. The use of specific C2 servers (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw) indicates that these are the servers the attackers have chosen for their command-and-control activities.
   - Step 4: Given the nature of malware and the use of C2 servers, it is plausible that the new Taidoor variant would continue to communicate with the same or similar C2 servers to maintain its operational capabilities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
