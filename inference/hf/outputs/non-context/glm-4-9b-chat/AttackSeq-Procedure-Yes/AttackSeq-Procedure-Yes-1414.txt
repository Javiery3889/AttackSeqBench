1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question is asking whether it's likely that other macOS malware such as Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis would use specific initial access techniques before dropping Poseidon payloads via a malicious crate named 'rustdecimal'.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Binding a shell to a port
     - Spreading through DMGs (Disk Images)
     - Exploiting CVE-2020-9934

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that it is likely that the mentioned macOS malware would use one of the initial access techniques before dropping the Poseidon payload.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that it is not likely that the mentioned macOS malware would use one of the initial access techniques before dropping the Poseidon payload.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Alchimist, ChromeLoader, and CloudMensis are known macOS malware families. These families are likely to use a variety of techniques to gain initial access to a system.
   - Step 2: Binding a shell to a port is a common initial access technique that can allow malware to maintain persistence and receive commands from a remote attacker.
   - Step 3: Spreading through DMGs is another common initial access technique for macOS malware, as DMGs can be easily distributed and executed.
   - Step 4: Exploiting CVE-2020-9934 is a specific vulnerability that could be exploited to gain initial access to a system without requiring user interaction.
   - Step 5: Given that these malware families are designed to compromise macOS systems, it is plausible that they would use one or more of these initial access techniques before deploying additional payloads like Poseidon.
   - Step 6: Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the answer is likely to be "Yes," as these initial access techniques are commonly used by malware to establish a presence on a target system.

Final Answer: A: Yes
