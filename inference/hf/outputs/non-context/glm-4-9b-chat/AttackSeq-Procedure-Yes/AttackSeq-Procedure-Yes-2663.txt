Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the execution of a backdoor, installation of additional malware, and communication with a command and control (C2) server.
- The domain 'update.alyac.org' is mentioned, and it resolves to a South Korean IP address.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the infected computers communicated with the C2 server at the given IP address.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the infected computers did not communicate with the C2 server at the given IP address.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the following steps:
1. Execution of 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' to establish backdoor access.
2. Installation of additional malware to access user databases.
3. Communication with a C2 server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

The presence of a domain that resolves to a specific IP address is a common method for attackers to communicate with their C2 servers, as it allows for easier obfuscation and persistence. Therefore, it is likely that the infected computers would communicate with the C2 server.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The execution of a backdoor and installation of additional malware are typical steps in a cyber attack, which are followed by communication with a C2 server.
- The use of a domain to resolve to an IP address is a common technique for attackers to maintain anonymity and evade detection.
- Based on the sequence of TTPs described and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is reasonable to conclude that the infected computers would communicate with the C2 server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
