Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where threat actors have used phishing emails to infiltrate a client's supply chain.
- The context of the question is related to the SolarWinds and Kaseya cyber-attacks, which are known to be sophisticated and targeted.
- The question asks whether it is likely that these threat actors will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that the threat actors would gather victim organization information during reconnaissance.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that the threat actors would gather victim organization information during reconnaissance.

Given the context of the SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks, which are highly targeted and sophisticated, it is reasonable to assume that the threat actors would conduct thorough reconnaissance to understand their targets' environments and systems. Gathering victim organization information is a common step in such reconnaissance efforts to tailor the attack to the specific environment and to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The threat actors have already successfully used phishing emails to infiltrate the supply chain, indicating a level of sophistication and intent.
- Step 2: The nature of the SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks suggests a targeted approach, which requires detailed reconnaissance.
- Step 3: Gathering victim organization information is a standard practice in targeted attacks to understand the target's environment and systems.

Final Answer: A: Yes
