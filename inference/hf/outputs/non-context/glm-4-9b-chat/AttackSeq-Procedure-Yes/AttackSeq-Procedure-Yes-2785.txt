1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious app, XAgent, collects data from iOS devices.
   - The data collected includes text messages, contact lists, and geo-location information.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the app will exfiltrate this data via HTTP requests while communicating with its Command and Control (C&C) server using a Base64 encoded token for identification.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the app will exfiltrate the data via HTTP requests and use a Base64 encoded token for identification.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the app will exfiltrate the data via HTTP requests and use a Base64 encoded token for identification.

   To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice, we can consider the following:
   - Malware often exfiltrates data to a C&C server to maintain persistence and command and control.
   - HTTP requests are a common method for exfiltrating data due to their widespread use and the fact that they can be easily intercepted and analyzed.
   - Base64 encoding is a common method for encoding data to ensure that it is not easily readable in plain text, which is useful for obfuscating the data being transmitted.
   - Given the above, it is plausible that the malicious app would use HTTP requests and Base64 encoding for exfiltration and identification.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Malware often exfiltrates data to a C&C server, which is a common TTP.
   - Step 2: HTTP requests are a common method for exfiltration due to their ease of use and the fact that they can be used to send data over the internet.
   - Step 3: Base64 encoding is a common method for encoding data to prevent it from being easily readable, which is also a plausible TTP.
   - Step 4: Combining these TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the malicious XAgent app would use HTTP requests and Base64 encoding for exfiltration and identification.

Final Answer: A: Yes
