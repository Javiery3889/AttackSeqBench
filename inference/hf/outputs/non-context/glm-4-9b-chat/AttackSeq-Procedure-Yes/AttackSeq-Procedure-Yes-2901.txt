1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15. The sequence includes:
     a. Using Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
     b. Stealing a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
     c. Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
     d. Leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after obtaining domain administrator credentials and accessing the network remotely, APT15 deployed backdoors and used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that APT15 did not deploy backdoors or use RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings after the initial actions.

Given the context of the question, it is plausible that after gaining domain administrator credentials and VPN access, an attacker would look to establish a persistent presence on the network. Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS is a common step for attackers to maintain access and control over the compromised network. Additionally, using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings is a technique that could allow the attacker to execute commands without detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: APT15 has already obtained domain administrator credentials, which gives them significant control over the network.
   - Step 2: By stealing a VPN certificate, APT15 has the ability to access the network remotely, which is a common method for maintaining persistence.
   - Step 3: Deploying backdoors is a typical action for an attacker to ensure ongoing access to the network, even if the initial access is lost.
   - Step 4: Using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings is a technique that could be used to evade detection and maintain a stealthy presence on the network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
