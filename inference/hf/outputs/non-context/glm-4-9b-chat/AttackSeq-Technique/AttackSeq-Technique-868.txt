Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence involving GreyEnergy's operators using spearphishing and the compromise of servers as infection vectors.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before lateral movement to other workstations within the targeted organization's network.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not directly related to the initial compromise of servers or the subsequent lateral movement within the network.
- T1564-Hide Artifacts: This technique is about hiding evidence of the attack to avoid detection. It is typically used after the initial compromise and lateral movement have occurred, not before.
- T1217-Browser Information Discovery: This technique involves gathering information from web browsers, which could be part of the initial reconnaissance phase. However, it is not directly related to the compromise of servers or lateral movement.
- T1195-Supply Chain Compromise: This technique involves compromising a third-party component or service to deliver malicious content. This could be a plausible step before lateral movement, as it would allow the attackers to gain a foothold in the network through a trusted source.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial compromise of servers suggests that the attackers had a method to deliver their payload, which could be through a supply chain compromise.
- The question specifies that the compromise of servers was used as an infection vector, which aligns with the concept of a supply chain compromise.
- Lateral movement typically follows the initial compromise, and a supply chain compromise could be a precursor to this movement by providing a legitimate entry point into the network.

Final Answer: D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
