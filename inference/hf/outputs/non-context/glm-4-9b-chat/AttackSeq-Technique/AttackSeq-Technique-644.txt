1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where spear-phishing emails were used for initial access.
   - The activity mentioned involves Moafee and DragonOK deploying tools such as custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs (Remote Access Trojans) to support their campaigns.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates - This TTP refers to the use of code signing certificates to sign malicious software, which is not directly related to deploying tools like backdoors and RATs.
   - Answer Choice B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities - This TTP describes the action of adversaries obtaining tools or capabilities to support their campaigns. This aligns with the deployment of custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs.
   - Answer Choice C: T1491.001-Internal Defacement - This TTP involves defacing internal systems, which is not related to deploying tools for a campaign.
   - Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing - This TTP refers to the initial attack vector of using spear-phishing emails, which is already mentioned in the question as the initial access method, not the subsequent activity of deploying tools.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial access method is already accounted for in the question, so we are looking for the TTP that describes the deployment of tools like backdoors and RATs.
   - T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates and T1491.001-Internal Defacement are not relevant to the described activity.
   - T1566-Phishing is the initial access method, not the deployment of tools.
   - T1588-Obtain Capabilities is the most relevant TTP as it describes the action of obtaining tools to support a campaign, which matches the activity described in the question.

Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
