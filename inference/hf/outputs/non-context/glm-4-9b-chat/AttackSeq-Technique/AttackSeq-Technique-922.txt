Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence that starts with vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers.
- The next step in the sequence is the use of the Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services: This technique involves exploiting a remote service to gain a foothold in the network. It does not necessarily involve spreading further within the network.
- B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting a publicly accessible application to gain access to the network. This could be a plausible step before using a trojan for remote execution, as it would allow the attacker to initially access the network.
- C: T1480.001-Environmental Keying: This technique involves using environment variables or other system settings to store information. It is not directly related to spreading within a network.
- D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media: This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. It is not relevant to the described scenario, as the malware is being executed remotely and not spread through physical media.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question suggests that the attacker has already identified and exploited a web server, which is a public-facing application.
- The next step is to use a trojan for remote execution, which implies that the attacker has already established a presence within the network.
- Based on this, the most plausible technique that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network would be the one that directly relates to exploiting a public-facing application, which is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
