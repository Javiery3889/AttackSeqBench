Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving Emissary Panda.
- The sequence is as follows:
  1. Emissary Panda leveraged Active Scanning to identify systems with vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144.
  2. The next TTP occurred before gaining initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 on Microsoft SharePoint servers.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains, which is more about reconnaissance and information gathering rather than a direct method of exploitation.
- Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique is about using application layer protocols to gather information or exploit vulnerabilities. It could be a plausible step before exploitation, as it might involve identifying the correct protocol to exploit (CVE-2019-0604).
- Answer Choice C: T1595-Active Scanning - This technique is mentioned as the first step in the question, so it cannot be the next step in the sequence.
- Answer Choice D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers - This technique is about using systemd timers to execute malicious code at a later time. It is not directly related to the initial exploitation of CVE-2019-0604.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question starts with Active Scanning (T1595), which is already mentioned as the first step.
- The next step must be a technique that is related to the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604, which is a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint servers.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible choice because it involves using application layer protocols to exploit vulnerabilities, which is consistent with the context of CVE-2019-0604.
- T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains is less likely because it is more about reconnaissance than exploitation.
- T1053.006-Systemd Timers is not directly related to the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
