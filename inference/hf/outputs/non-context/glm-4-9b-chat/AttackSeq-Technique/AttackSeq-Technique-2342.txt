Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where a PowerPoint add-in document is delivered, which contains an auto-open VBA macro for execution.
- The sequence continues with the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: delivery of a PowerPoint add-in document, execution of a VBA macro, and use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing - This technique involves delivering malicious content through phishing emails or messages. While phishing is a common initial attack vector, the question does not mention phishing as part of the sequence.
- Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter - This technique involves using a command-line interpreter to execute scripts. The use of 'mshta.exe' is a command-line interpreter, so this could be a plausible technique.
- Answer Choice C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking - This technique involves manipulating the DLL search order to load malicious DLLs. There is no mention of DLL search order manipulation in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter - This is a duplicate of Answer Choice B and should be evaluated in the same way.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events starts with the delivery of a malicious document, which is not directly related to the TTPs listed.
- The next event is the execution of a VBA macro, which is not explicitly listed in the TTPs but could be considered a scripting activity.
- The final event is the use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper. This is a command-line interpreter, which aligns with T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
