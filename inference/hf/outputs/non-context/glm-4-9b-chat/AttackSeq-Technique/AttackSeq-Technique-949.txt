Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where Sednit's downloaders and backdoors establish communications with a C&C (Command and Control) server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the order in which these actions occurred.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution - This technique involves resolving domain names at runtime, which could be used to avoid static IP blocking. It is not directly related to establishing communications with a C&C server.
- Answer Choice B: T1113-Screen Capture - This technique is used to capture the screen of a user's device, which is not related to establishing communications with a C&C server.
- Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique is used to establish a secure communication channel between the attacker's system and the victim's system. This is a plausible TTP that could occur before the downloaders and backdoors establish communications with the C&C server.
- Answer Choice D: T1547.012-Print Processors - This technique is used to execute code through the print spooler service, which is not related to establishing communications with a C&C server.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The most plausible TTP that would occur before the downloaders and backdoors establish communications with the C&C server is one that sets up a secure channel for communication.
- T1568-Dynamic Resolution and T1547.012-Print Processors are not directly related to establishing communications with a C&C server.
- T1113-Screen Capture is also unrelated to the communication process.
- T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant TTP as it directly addresses the need for a secure communication channel, which is likely to be used before the downloaders and backdoors communicate with the C&C server.

Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
