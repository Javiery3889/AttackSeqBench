Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has deployed multiple variants of a custom VBS (Visual Basic Script) backdoor and executed VBS scripts for potential data collection.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to establish communication with Shuckworm's servers and download additional payloads.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. It is a plausible method for establishing communication after deploying a backdoor.
- B: T1571-Non-Standard Port: This technique is about using non-standard ports for communication, which could be a part of the communication process but is not as directly related to the application layer as T1071.
- C: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job: This technique is related to using container orchestration tools to execute jobs, which is not directly related to the scenario described in the question.
- D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute code at a later time. While it could be used for persistence, it is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 server.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario involves deploying a backdoor and executing scripts for data collection, which suggests that the attacker would need to establish communication with a C2 server to download additional payloads.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most directly related technique to establishing communication with a C2 server, as it involves using application layer protocols for communication.
- T1571-Non-Standard Port could be part of the communication process, but it is not as directly related as T1071.
- T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job and T1053-Scheduled Task/Job are not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 server.

Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
