Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where malware evaded detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker.
- It mentions the use of InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, to execute its payload via proxy execution.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Malware evaded detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker.
  2. Used InstallUtil.exe to execute payload via proxy execution.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing - This technique involves delivering the malware through phishing emails or messages. It does not directly relate to the use of InstallUtil.exe or proxy execution.
- Answer Choice B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space - This technique is about reducing the number of keys that need to be checked in a registry or configuration file. It is not related to the described sequence of events.
- Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding - This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to avoid detection. While it could be a part of the overall attack, it does not specifically address the use of InstallUtil.exe or proxy execution.
- Answer Choice D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution - This technique involves using trusted utilities to execute code in a way that bypasses security controls. This directly aligns with the use of InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, to execute the payload via proxy execution.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the use of a trusted utility (InstallUtil.exe) to execute a payload, which is a characteristic of T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution.
- The other answer choices do not align with the specific sequence of events involving the use of InstallUtil.exe and proxy execution.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution.

Final Answer: D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution
