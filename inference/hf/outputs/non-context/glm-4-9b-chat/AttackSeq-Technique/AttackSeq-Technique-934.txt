Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious macro executed a PowerShell script, which then released OfficeUpdateService.exe.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after these actions but before the backdoor program gathered host information.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- T1556.008-Network Provider DLL: This technique involves using a network provider DLL to bypass security controls. It is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script or gathering host information.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique is about using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. It could be a plausible step after executing a PowerShell script and releasing a backdoor, as it might be used to communicate with the C2 server.
- T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery: This technique is about discovering cloud infrastructure. It is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script or gathering host information.
- T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: This technique is about evading virtualization and sandbox environments. It is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script or gathering host information.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the execution of a PowerShell script and the release of a backdoor program. The next logical step would likely be to establish communication with a command and control server to receive instructions or to exfiltrate data.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible answer because it aligns with the need for communication after the initial script execution and backdoor release.
- The other techniques (T1556.008, T1580, and T1497) do not fit the context of the question as well as T1071 does.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
