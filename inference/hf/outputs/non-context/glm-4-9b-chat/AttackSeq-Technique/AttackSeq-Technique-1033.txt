1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the loading of a backdoor called "Kingslayer" via malicious 'Alpha' software subversion. The sequence continues with the backdoor evading detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Loading of Kingslayer backdoor via malicious 'Alpha' software subversion.
     2. Evading detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1219-Remote Access Software - This technique refers to the use of remote access tools to maintain persistence on a system. It does not directly relate to the initial loading of a backdoor or the use of a beacon sleep algorithm.
   - Answer Choice B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication - This technique involves using domain credentials to authenticate to a domain controller. It is not directly related to the initial loading of a backdoor or the use of a beacon sleep algorithm.
   - Answer Choice C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code - This technique refers to the use of polymorphic code to evade detection. While it is related to evading detection, it does not directly relate to the initial loading of a backdoor or the use of a beacon sleep algorithm.
   - Answer Choice D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls - This technique involves bypassing or manipulating security controls to gain unauthorized access. It could be a plausible step before evading detection using a beacon sleep algorithm, as it might involve setting up the environment for the backdoor to operate without being detected.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question suggests that the backdoor has already been loaded, so the first step is not relevant to the answer choices provided.
   - The second step involves evading detection, which is a common action after a backdoor is loaded. Among the answer choices, T1027.014-Polymorphic Code is the closest to evading detection, but it does not involve the use of a beacon sleep algorithm.
   - T1553-Subvert Trust Controls is a plausible step before evading detection, as it could involve setting up the environment for the backdoor to operate without being detected, potentially through the use of a beacon sleep algorithm to avoid continuous monitoring.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the information provided is that after the backdoor was loaded, the attacker would likely subvert trust controls to ensure the backdoor can operate without detection.

Final Answer: D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls
