Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence that starts with the use of social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information (reconnaissance).
- The next step in the sequence is leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1059.002-AppleScript - This technique involves using AppleScript to execute scripts on macOS systems. It is not directly related to the described sequence of reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
- Answer Choice B: T1558.002-Silver Ticket - This technique is related to the exploitation of Kerberos authentication in Windows environments. It is not relevant to the described sequence.
- Answer Choice C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information - This technique involves collecting information about the target's network. While it is a reconnaissance technique, it does not directly lead to the use of HTTPS landing pages for credential harvesting.
- Answer Choice D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials - This technique involves creating forged web credentials, which is a plausible step before using HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials. It fits the sequence of reconnaissance followed by credential harvesting.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves reconnaissance using social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information.
- The next step is to use HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials, which suggests a web-based attack.
- T1606-Forge Web Credentials is the most relevant technique to the described sequence because it involves creating forged web credentials, which can be used in conjunction with HTTPS landing pages to mimic legitimate password recovery or reset emails and harvest credentials.
- The other answer choices do not align with the described sequence as they are either not related to web-based attacks or do not fit the sequence of reconnaissance followed by credential harvesting.

Final Answer: D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials
