1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where DLL side-loading is used to execute the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to maintain the malware's presence on the system after the initial execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page: This technique involves modifying the Outlook home page to deliver malicious content. It is not directly related to maintaining malware presence on the system.
   - B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking: This technique involves hooking into credential APIs to steal credentials. While it is a common TTP, it is not specifically about maintaining malware presence.
   - C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: This technique is about ensuring that the malware runs at system startup or logon, which is directly related to maintaining the malware's presence on the system.
   - D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly related to maintaining malware presence on the system.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question specifically asks for a technique that would maintain the malware's presence on the system after it has been executed using DLL side-loading.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most relevant technique because it directly addresses the persistence of the malware on the system by ensuring it runs at critical system startup or logon events.
   - The other techniques (T1137.004, T1056.004, and T1190) do not directly address the persistence aspect of the malware on the system.

Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
