Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where multistage downloaders have established execution and legitimate-looking phishing websites are used to redirect targets for credential harvesting.
- The key action mentioned is the capture of credentials by logging victim input on fake OWA (Outlook Web Access) login pages.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the target. While it could be part of the overall attack, it does not directly address the credential capture aspect.
- B: T1056-Input Capture: This technique is used to capture user input, such as keystrokes or other data entered by the user. This aligns with the description of logging victim input on fake OWA login pages.
- C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography: This technique involves the use of symmetric encryption to protect data. It is not directly related to credential capture.
- D: T1110.003-Password Spraying: This technique involves using a list of common passwords to attempt to authenticate to multiple accounts. It does not involve capturing credentials from a fake login page.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario described in the question involves the direct capture of credentials, which is a clear indication of input capture.
- T1056-Input Capture is the technique that directly corresponds to the action of logging victim input on fake OWA login pages.
- None of the other answer choices (T1071, T1573.001, T1110.003) are directly related to the described action of credential capture.

Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture
