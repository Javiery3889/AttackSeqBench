Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and saves the output for use in subsequent phases.
- The next event mentioned is the KopiLuwak backdoor communicating with two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1135-Network Share Discovery: This technique is used to discover network shares on a network. It does not involve communicating with external websites.
- B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling: This technique is used to bypass network security controls by encapsulating network traffic within another protocol. While it could be used to communicate with external sites, it is not specific to communicating with legitimate websites for commands.
- C: T1102-Web Service: This technique involves using a web service to communicate with a system. Since the backdoor is communicating with legitimate websites, this could be a plausible technique.
- D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job: This technique is used to create or modify scheduled tasks on a system. It does not involve communicating with external websites.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events involves the backdoor communicating with external websites, which suggests a method of communication over the network.
- T1102-Web Service is the most relevant technique as it directly involves using a web service for communication, which aligns with the backdoor's actions of receiving and sending commands.
- The other techniques do not involve the specific action of communicating with external websites for commands.

Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
