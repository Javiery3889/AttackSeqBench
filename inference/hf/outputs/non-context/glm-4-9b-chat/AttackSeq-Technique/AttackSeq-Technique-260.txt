1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker is using Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to avoid detection. The context is that this is part of the initial access phase, and we are looking for the TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) that most likely occurred to compromise external remote services.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging: This technique involves using a legitimate process to hide malicious code. It is not directly related to compromising external remote services or using Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.
   - B: T1078.001-Default Accounts: This technique involves using default or common account credentials to gain access to systems. While it could be part of the initial access phase, it does not directly relate to the use of Cloud Shell or reverse SSH tunneling.
   - C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading: This technique involves using a legitimate application to load malicious code from a network traffic stream. It is not directly related to the use of Cloud Shell or reverse SSH tunneling.
   - D: T1133-External Remote Services: This technique involves using external remote services to establish a presence on a network. This aligns with the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling, as it suggests the attacker is using an external service to maintain access.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question specifies that the attacker is using Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling, which is an external remote service. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred during the initial access phase to compromise external remote services is T1133-External Remote Services.
   - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the use of Cloud Shell or the specific context of the question.

Final Answer: D: T1133-External Remote Services
