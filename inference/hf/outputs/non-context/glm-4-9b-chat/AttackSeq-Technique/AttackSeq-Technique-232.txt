   - D: T1566-Phishing: This technique involves sending malicious documents (such as emails with attachments) to victims to trick them into executing actions that lead to a compromise.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The scenario described in the question involves the delivery of malicious documents, which is a common method used in phishing attacks.
   - Phishing is a well-known method for delivering malicious documents that can contain batch files or other payloads.
   - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the delivery of documents, which is the key aspect of the scenario.

Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
