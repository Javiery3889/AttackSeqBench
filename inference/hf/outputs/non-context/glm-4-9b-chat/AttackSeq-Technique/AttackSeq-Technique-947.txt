1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) performed by the Sednit group. The sequence involves scanning for files with specific extensions, staging data containing paths of files to exfiltrate, and then sending the data to a Command and Control (C&C) server.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Scanning for files matching specific extensions
     2. Staging data containing paths of files to exfiltrate
     3. Sending data to the C&C server

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1113-Screen Capture: This technique involves capturing the screen of a user's device. It does not involve scanning for files or exfiltrating data, so it is unlikely to be the technique that occurred after scanning and staging.
   - B: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture: This technique is about capturing web portal credentials. It is not directly related to scanning files or exfiltrating data, so it is also unlikely to be the correct technique.
   - C: T1070-Indicator Removal: This technique involves removing indicators of the attacker's presence from the system. It could be a plausible step before sending data to a C&C server, as the attacker might want to cover their tracks. However, it does not directly involve the exfiltration process.
   - D: T1599-Network Boundary Bridging: This technique is about using a compromised system to communicate with a network segment that is otherwise isolated. It is not directly related to scanning files or exfiltrating data, so it is unlikely to be the correct technique.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question involves scanning for files, staging data, and then exfiltrating the data. The TTP that would most logically occur after staging the data and before exfiltration would be one that is related to the exfiltration process itself.
   - T1113 and T1056 are not directly related to the exfiltration process, and T1599 is about network communication, which is not the focus of the described sequence.
   - T1070-Indicator Removal could be a plausible step before exfiltration, but it does not directly involve the exfiltration process itself.

Given the context of the question, none of the provided answer choices perfectly fit the sequence after scanning and staging but before exfiltration. However, if we have to choose the most plausible option, T1070-Indicator Removal (C) is the closest, as it could be a step taken to prepare for exfiltration by cleaning up any signs of the attacker's presence.

Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal
