1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where the InfoOS module has gathered system information, and the RemoteShell module has listed installed applications and iPhone backups. The task is to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these Discovery steps.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - InfoOS module gathers system information
     - RemoteShell module lists installed applications and iPhone backups

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1090-Proxy - This technique involves using a proxy to intercept and manipulate network traffic. It is not directly related to the discovery of system information or installed applications.
   - B: T1057-Process Discovery - This technique is about identifying and collecting information about running processes on a system. It is a plausible step after gathering system information and listing installed applications, as it could involve further discovery of processes that might be relevant to the attack.
   - C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture - This technique is about capturing user input from the GUI, which is not directly related to the discovery of system information or installed applications.
   - D: T1040-Network Sniffing - This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. While it could be a subsequent step in some attacks, it is not as directly related to the discovery of system information or installed applications as T1057-Process Discovery.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The InfoOS module gathering system information is a broad discovery step that could be followed by any number of discovery techniques.
   - The RemoteShell module listing installed applications and iPhone backups is a specific discovery step that suggests the attacker is interested in the software and data on the system.
   - T1057-Process Discovery is a logical next step after gathering system information and listing installed applications, as it would involve identifying and collecting information about the processes that are currently running on the system, which could be relevant to the attacker's goals.
   - T1090-Proxy and T1056.002-GUI Input Capture are not as directly related to the discovery of system information and installed applications as T1057-Process Discovery.
   - T1040-Network Sniffing could be a subsequent step, but it is not as closely aligned with the discovery of system information and installed applications as T1057-Process Discovery.

Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery
