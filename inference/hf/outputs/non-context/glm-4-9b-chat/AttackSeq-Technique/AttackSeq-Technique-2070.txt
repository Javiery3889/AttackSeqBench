Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with Whitefly gaining initial access via spear-phishing emails containing a disguised dropper.
- The next step in the sequence is the execution of malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges.
- The MITRE ATT&CK framework is referenced, which is a model used to understand and categorize cyber attacks.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1608.004-Drive-by Target - This technique refers to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in web browsers or plugins to deliver malicious content without any user interaction. This does not align with the described scenario of executing malicious DLLs.
- Answer Choice B: T1018-Remote System Discovery - This technique involves gathering information about the network and system environment. It does not directly relate to executing malicious DLLs for privilege escalation.
- Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules - This technique involves using shared modules to execute code. While it is related to code execution, it does not specifically address the aspect of gaining elevated privileges.
- Answer Choice D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to install or update software on a system. It can be used to execute code and potentially gain elevated privileges, which aligns with the described scenario.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access via spear-phishing emails is not directly related to the execution of malicious DLLs, so we focus on the subsequent steps.
- The execution of malicious DLLs suggests the use of a loader, which is a common method to deliver and execute malicious code.
- Gaining elevated privileges is a critical step in many attacks, and using software deployment tools can be a way to achieve this by executing code with higher privileges.
- Based on the analysis, Answer Choice D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial access via spear-phishing emails.

Final Answer: D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools
