Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the Infamous Chisel malware that collects files from local systems based on predefined criteria and then uses a Tor hidden service to exfiltrate them. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before providing SCP functionality and implementing SSH relays for communication.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to achieve persistence or to execute malicious code. While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the use of Tor hidden services or SCP functionality.
- B: T1071.001-Web Protocols: This technique involves using web protocols to communicate with the victim. While it could be used for exfiltration, it does not specifically address the use of Tor or SCP.
- C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using non-standard protocols for communication, which could include Tor for exfiltration. It is plausible that this technique would be used before implementing SCP functionality and SSH relays.
- D: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery: This technique involves actions to prevent the system from recovering, which is not directly related to the use of Tor or SCP for exfiltration.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the malware collecting files and then exfiltrating them using a Tor hidden service. This suggests that the malware would need to establish a communication channel that is not easily traceable, which is what T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol addresses.
- The use of SCP functionality and SSH relays for communication is a method of securely transferring files, which would likely be implemented after the initial exfiltration method (Tor hidden service) is established.
- Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred before providing SCP functionality and implementing SSH relays is T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
