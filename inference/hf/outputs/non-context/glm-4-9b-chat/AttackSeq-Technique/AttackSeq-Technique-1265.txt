Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where a PowerShell script decrypted registry contents, executed a new script, and established njRAT as a remote access tool.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. PowerShell script decrypts registry contents
  2. Execution of a new script
  3. Establishment of njRAT as a remote access tool

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1008-Fallback Channels - This technique refers to the use of alternative methods to communicate when the primary method is blocked or unavailable. It does not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.
- Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the compromised system. It could be a plausible step after a new script has been executed, as it might establish a communication channel for njRAT.
- Answer Choice C: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography - This technique involves the use of public and private keys for encryption and decryption. While it is a common method for securing communications, it does not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1129-Shared Modules - This technique refers to the use of shared modules to execute code. It does not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question, as it does not involve the establishment of a remote access tool.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the execution of scripts and the establishment of a remote access tool. The most plausible technique that would occur after these steps is one that involves establishing a communication channel for the remote access tool.
- T1008-Fallback Channels and T1129-Shared Modules do not fit the context of the question as they do not involve establishing a communication channel.
- T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography is not directly related to the sequence of events.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible answer because it involves using application layer protocols to communicate, which is a likely step after a new script has been executed to establish njRAT as a remote access tool.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
