1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving APT42, who gained initial access through spear phishing and bypassing MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
   - The sequence also mentions credential harvesting efforts with lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: spear phishing, bypassing MFA, credential harvesting, and the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate: This technique involves installing a root certificate on a system, which is not directly related to credential harvesting or the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
   - B: T1587-Develop Capabilities: This technique refers to the development of tools or capabilities that can be used in an attack. It is plausible that APT42 would develop such tools to complement their credential harvesting efforts.
   - C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts: This technique involves using social media accounts to gather information or to conduct spear phishing. While it is related to spear phishing, it does not directly address the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors.
   - D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing: This technique involves targeting individuals within an organization, which is similar to the initial access method mentioned in the question. However, it does not address the use of lightweight tools and custom backdoors.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question specifies that APT42 used lightweight tools and custom backdoors in conjunction with credential harvesting. This suggests that the technique used before gaining initial access would be related to the development of such tools.
   - T1553.004-Install Root Certificate is not directly related to the described attack sequence.
   - T1586.001-Social Media Accounts is related to spear phishing but does not address the development of tools.
   - T1534-Internal Spearphishing is related to the initial access method but does not address the development of tools.
   - T1587-Develop Capabilities is the most relevant to the described attack sequence, as it involves the creation of tools that can be used for credential harvesting and the deployment of custom backdoors.

Final Answer: B: T1587-Develop Capabilities
