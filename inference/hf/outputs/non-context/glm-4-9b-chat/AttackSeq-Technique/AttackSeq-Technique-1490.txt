Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed Babar to capture data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes Babar initiating communication with its C&C servers through remote thread injection.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1056.001-Keylogging: This technique involves capturing keystrokes from a user's keyboard. While it could be used to capture data, it does not directly relate to using global Windows hooks.
- B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: This technique is about exfiltrating data using non-standard protocols. It does not involve capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.
- C: T1113-Screen Capture: This technique involves capturing the screen content, which could be used to capture data from desktop applications. It is possible that Babar used this technique to capture data before initiating communication with C&C servers.
- D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique is about executing commands or scripts. It does not directly relate to capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that Babar captured data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks. This indicates that the technique used was related to capturing visual content or keystrokes, which is not directly associated with T1056.001 or T1059.
- T1048 is about exfiltration, not data capture, so it is not the correct choice.
- T1113, Screen Capture, is the most plausible technique as it aligns with the description of capturing data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.

Final Answer: C: T1113-Screen Capture
