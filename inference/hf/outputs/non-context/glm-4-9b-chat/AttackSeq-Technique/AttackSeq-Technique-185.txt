Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the use of Infamous Chisel, which collects files, and then exfiltrates them using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that enables the attacker to enumerate data directories and gather system information before exfiltration.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1606.001-Web Cookies: This technique is related to web application attacks and does not involve local system enumeration or gathering system information.
- B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique is about bypassing application layer protocols and is not directly related to local system enumeration or gathering system information.
- C: T1087.004-Cloud Account: This technique is about accessing cloud accounts and is not relevant to local system enumeration or gathering system information.
- D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery: This technique involves enumerating files and directories on a system, which is directly related to the task of collecting predefined files of interest and gathering system information.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves collecting files and then exfiltrating them, which implies that the attacker needs to know where the files are located on the system.
- The technique that best fits this description is T1083-File and Directory Discovery, as it is specifically designed to enumerate files and directories, which is necessary for the attacker to identify and collect the predefined files of interest.
- The other answer choices do not align with the task of local system enumeration and gathering system information.

Final Answer: D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery
