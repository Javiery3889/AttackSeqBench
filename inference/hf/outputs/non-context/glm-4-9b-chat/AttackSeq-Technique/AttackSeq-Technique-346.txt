Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through a compromised software update using the Supply Chain Compromise technique (T1199).
- The next step in the sequence is the execution of code using system services.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1057-Process Discovery - This technique involves enumerating running processes on a system. It is not directly related to executing code using system services.
- Answer Choice B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence - This technique is about clearing persistence mechanisms to avoid detection. It is not directly related to executing code using system services.
- Answer Choice C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT - These are tools that can be used to automate tasks on a system, but they are not specific to executing code using system services.
- Answer Choice D: T1569-System Services - This technique involves adding a new service to the system or modifying an existing one to execute malicious code. This is the most relevant to the described scenario of executing code using system services.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is gained through a compromised software update, which is a Supply Chain Compromise (T1199).
- The next step in the sequence is to execute code using system services.
- T1057 (Process Discovery) and T1070.009 (Clear Persistence) are not directly related to executing code using system services.
- T1059.010 (AutoHotKey & AutoIT) are tools that can be used for automation but are not specific to system services.
- T1569 (System Services) is the most relevant technique as it involves adding or modifying system services to execute code, which aligns with the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services
