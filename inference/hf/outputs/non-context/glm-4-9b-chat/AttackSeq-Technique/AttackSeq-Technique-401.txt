Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that likely occurred in an attack. The sequence includes enabling Macro content to execute the payload through cmd.exe and Rundll32, followed by SSL communication with a command and control server using an expired digital certificate.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Enabling Macro content to execute the payload through cmd.exe and Rundll32
  2. SSL communication with a command and control server using an expired digital certificate

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence:

A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a command and control server. While it is a plausible technique for the SSL communication part of the sequence, it does not directly relate to the initial execution of the payload through cmd.exe and Rundll32.

B: T1542.003-Bootkit
- A bootkit is a type of malware that infects the boot process of an operating system. This technique is not directly related to the described sequence, as it does not involve the execution of a payload through cmd.exe and Rundll32 or SSL communication.

C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files
- This technique involves storing credentials in files. It is not directly related to the described sequence, as it does not involve the execution of a payload through cmd.exe and Rundll32 or SSL communication.

D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
- This technique involves evading detection in virtualized environments or sandboxes. It is not directly related to the described sequence, as it does not involve the execution of a payload through cmd.exe and Rundll32 or SSL communication.

E: T1083-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- This technique involves using command-line tools or scripting interpreters to execute code. This aligns with the first part of the sequence, where the payload is executed through cmd.exe and Rundll32. It does not directly address the SSL communication part, but it is the most relevant to the initial execution of the payload.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1083-Command and Scripting Interpreter, as it aligns with the initial execution of the payload through cmd.exe and Rundll32.
- The SSL communication with a command and control server using an expired digital certificate is not directly addressed by any of the answer choices, but it is a common technique for evading detection during communication with malicious servers.

Final Answer: T1083-Command and Scripting Interpreter
