1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question is asking which ATT&CK technique facilitated the hiding of the 'mothership' control server's location during the 'Red October' campaign.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the communication with C&C servers and the subsequent hiding of the mothership control server's location.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique involves using command-line interpreters to execute scripts. It is not directly related to hiding the location of a control server.
   - B: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking: This technique is used to load malicious DLLs before legitimate ones, which can be used to bypass security controls. It is not directly related to hiding the location of a control server.
   - C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution: This technique involves using dynamic resolution to resolve domain names to IP addresses at runtime, which can be used to hide the actual location of a server. This is a plausible technique for hiding the location of a control server.
   - D: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols: This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication, which can be used to establish a command and control channel. However, it does not directly address the hiding of the server's location.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question is specifically asking about the technique used to hide the location of the mothership control server, not just the communication method.
   - T1059 and T1574.001 are not directly related to hiding the server's location.
   - T1071.005 is related to communication but does not address the hiding of the server's location.
   - T1568-Dynamic Resolution is the most plausible technique for hiding the location of the mothership control server, as it allows for the resolution of domain names to IP addresses at runtime, which can be manipulated to hide the actual server location.

Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
