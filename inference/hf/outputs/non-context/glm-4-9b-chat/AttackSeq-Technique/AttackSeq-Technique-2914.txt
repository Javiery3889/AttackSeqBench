Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
- The attacker then deployed backdoors such as RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution.
- We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before deploying these backdoors.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow - This technique involves accessing or modifying the contents of the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files on Unix-like systems. This is not directly related to the scenario described, as the question mentions domain administrator credentials, which are typically associated with Windows systems.
- Answer Choice B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories - This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, such as configuration files, to gather information. While this could be part of the attacker's process, it does not directly relate to the deployment of backdoors.
- Answer Choice C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system. Since Mimikatz is a tool used for credential dumping, this choice aligns well with the scenario described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads - This technique involves embedding malicious payloads within legitimate files or processes. While this could be a subsequent step in the attack, it does not directly relate to the initial credential acquisition.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario involves an attacker using Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, which is a form of credential dumping.
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be the attacker first gaining the credentials (credential dumping) and then deploying backdoors.
- Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before deploying the backdoors is T1003-OS Credential Dumping.

Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping
