Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker first scans for vulnerable websites to identify potential targets.
- The sequence continues with the attacker ensuring code execution on unpatched systems by exploiting CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.
- We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the described action.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. It could be a step in the attack sequence, but it does not necessarily involve scanning for vulnerable websites.
- Answer Choice B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment - This technique involves sending a spear-phishing email with an attachment. It is a method of delivering the exploit, but it does not involve scanning for vulnerable websites.
- Answer Choice C: T1562-Impair Defenses - This technique is about disrupting or bypassing security defenses. It could be a step before the exploit delivery, but it does not involve scanning for vulnerable websites.
- Answer Choice D: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code - This technique involves using polymorphic code to avoid detection. It is not directly related to scanning for vulnerable websites or delivering an exploit.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible TTP that occurred before the described action is scanning for vulnerable websites. None of the provided answer choices directly correspond to scanning for vulnerable websites. However, if we have to choose the most relevant TTP from the given options, we should consider the sequence of steps that would lead to the exploitation of CVE-2018-20250 via spear-phishing.

The sequence of steps would likely be:
1. Scan for vulnerable websites (not directly listed in the answer choices).
2. Identify potential targets.
3. Impair defenses to bypass security measures (T1562-Impair Defenses).
4. Deliver the exploit via spear-phishing (T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment).
5. Ensure code execution on unpatched systems by exploiting CVE-2018-20250 (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: C: T1562-Impair Defenses
