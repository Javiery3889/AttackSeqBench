Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have gathered detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI queries and collected system details for assessment during discovery.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Gathered detailed information using WMI queries
  2. Collected system details for assessment during discovery

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1070.003-Clear Command History
  - This technique is about clearing command history to hide evidence of the attacker's presence. It does not involve gathering information or collecting data for assessment.
- Answer Choice B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
  - This technique involves decoding or deobfuscating files or information, which is not directly related to the initial gathering of system details.
- Answer Choice C: T1560-Archive Collected Data
  - This technique is about archiving collected data, which would come after the data has been gathered and assessed. It is not a surveillance technique but rather a post-gathering action.
- Answer Choice D: T1005-Data from Local System
  - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the description of gathering system details for assessment during discovery.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial action described in the question is the gathering of detailed information using WMI queries, which is a method of collecting data from the local system.
- The subsequent action is collecting system details for assessment, which is consistent with the objective of gathering data from the local system.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs related to the surveillance objectives described in the question is T1005-Data from Local System.

Final Answer: D: T1005-Data from Local System
