Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where Dridex uses heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques to evade detection.
- It then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to communicate data such as computer name and botnet ID number with its Command and Control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. While this is a valid method for communication, it does not specifically address the use of encrypted POST requests.
- Answer Choice B: T1622-Debugger Evasion - This technique is about evading detection by debuggers, which is mentioned in the question as a method used by Dridex. However, it does not pertain to the communication of data with the C2 server.
- Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding - This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to avoid detection. Since the question mentions that the data is communicated via encrypted POST requests, this technique could be used to encode the data before sending it over the network.
- Answer Choice D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations - This technique is about determining the physical locations of systems, which is not related to the communication of data with the C2 server.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that Dridex uses heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques, which are not directly related to the communication method.
- The communication method mentioned is via encrypted POST requests, which suggests that the data is being encoded or encrypted before transmission.
- Among the answer choices, T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding is the most relevant to the scenario described, as it involves encoding data in a way that is not standard, which could be part of the process to communicate data securely over the network.

Final Answer: C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding
