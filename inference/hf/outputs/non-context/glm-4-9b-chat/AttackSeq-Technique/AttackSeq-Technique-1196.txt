1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a BlackEnergy dropper achieves persistence by creating a LNK file in the startup folder to execute the command "rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT\",#1" on system boot.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the method by which the dropper achieves persistence.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1569-System Services: This technique involves using system services to achieve persistence. While it is a common method for persistence, the question does not specify the use of system services.
   - B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique involves using command-line tools or scripts to execute code. The creation of a LNK file in the startup folder to execute a command is a form of using a command and scripting interpreter to achieve persistence.
   - C: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller: This technique involves compromising a domain controller to gain unauthorized access to a network. It is not related to the described persistence mechanism.
   - D: T1485-Data Destruction: This technique involves destroying data on a system. It is not related to the described persistence mechanism.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes the persistence mechanism used by the BlackEnergy dropper, which is the creation of a LNK file in the startup folder to execute a command.
   - This action is a clear example of using a command and scripting interpreter to achieve persistence, as it involves scripting or command-line tools to execute a command on system boot.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the described persistence is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
