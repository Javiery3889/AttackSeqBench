Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where APT-TOCS first relies on lateral movement within the internal network to conduct attacks.
- The sequence then mentions that the attacker communicates with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.
- We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred between these two steps.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1562.004-Disable or Modify System Firewall: This technique is about disabling or modifying system firewalls, which is more about initial access rather than lateral movement or communication.
- B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which is not directly related to lateral movement or communication via HTTP GET requests.
- C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique is about using application layer protocols to move laterally within a network, which aligns with the first part of the described attack sequence.
- D: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique is about establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which could be part of the communication step but is not directly related to lateral movement.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves first moving laterally within the network and then communicating with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible technique that fits between these two steps, as it is specifically about lateral movement within a network.
- The other answer choices do not fit as well with the described sequence of events.

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
