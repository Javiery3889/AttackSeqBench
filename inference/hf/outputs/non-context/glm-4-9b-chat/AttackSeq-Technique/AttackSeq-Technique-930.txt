Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where attackers first leverage keylogging capabilities to gain administrator passwords.
- The next step in the sequence is the use of writable mass storage devices for USB infection to spread across the network.
- We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this sequence.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking: This technique involves intercepting SSH sessions to hijack them for unauthorized access. It does not involve keylogging or the use of USB devices.
- B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique is about using application layer protocols to gather information or move data. It could be used to exfiltrate data after obtaining passwords, but it does not directly relate to keylogging or USB infection.
- C: T1216.001-PubPrn: This technique involves using public-facing services to print documents, which is not related to keylogging or USB infection.
- D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services: This technique is about exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain unauthorized access. It could be used to install keylogging software on a system, which would allow attackers to obtain administrator passwords.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves first obtaining administrator passwords, which suggests that the attackers needed to gain access to a system.
- T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is the most plausible technique to have occurred before the use of keylogging, as it could be used to install the keylogging software.
- Once the keylogging software is installed, the attackers would have the administrator passwords, which would allow them to use writable mass storage devices for USB infection to spread across the network.

Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
