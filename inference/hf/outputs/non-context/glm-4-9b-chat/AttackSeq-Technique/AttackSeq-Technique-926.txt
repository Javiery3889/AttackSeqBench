1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving an Explosive Trojan that has already leveraged its capabilities to move laterally through the network using manual methods and USB infection.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - An Explosive Trojan (not a specific ATT&CK technique)
     - Lateral movement through the network using manual methods
     - USB infection

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
     - This technique involves using application layer protocols to move laterally. While it is a method of lateral movement, it does not specifically relate to the use of an Explosive Trojan or USB infection.
   - Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture
     - This technique is about capturing input from the keyboard, mouse, or other input devices. It is not directly related to lateral movement or USB infection.
   - Answer Choice C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket
     - This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to move laterally. It is a method that can be used by an attacker who has already compromised a system and is looking to move to another system within the network. It is a plausible technique after lateral movement using manual methods and USB infection.
   - Answer Choice D: T1552.008-Chat Messages
     - This technique involves using chat messages to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to lateral movement or USB infection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes an attack that has already involved lateral movement and USB infection, which suggests that the next step would likely be a technique that allows the attacker to move to another system within the network.
   - T1550.003-Pass the Ticket is the most plausible technique in this context because it is a method of lateral movement that can be used after an attacker has already moved laterally within the network.
   - The other answer choices do not align as closely with the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket
