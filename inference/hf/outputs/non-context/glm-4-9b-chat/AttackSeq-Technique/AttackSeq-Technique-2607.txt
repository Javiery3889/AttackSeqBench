Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where NanHaiShu is gathering system information and communicating with a Command and Control (C&C) server. The communication initially resolves to IP addresses in the United States and later switches to a Chinese IP address.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the method used to establish communication with the C&C servers.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution - This technique involves resolving domain names to IP addresses at runtime, which can be used to avoid static IP addresses that might be blocked or monitored. This could be a plausible method for the initial communication to resolve to a U.S. IP address and then switch to a Chinese IP address.
- Answer Choice B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution - This is a duplicate of Answer Choice A and does not provide additional information.
- Answer Choice C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information - This technique is about decoding or deobfuscating files or information, which is not directly related to establishing communication with C&C servers.
- Answer Choice D: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture - This technique involves capturing web traffic to steal credentials or other information. It is not directly related to resolving IP addresses or establishing communication with C&C servers.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The most plausible technique for establishing communication with C&C servers that initially resolve to IP addresses in the United States and later switch to a Chinese IP address is T1568-Dynamic Resolution. This technique is designed to resolve domain names to IP addresses dynamically, which can be used to change the IP address of the C&C server to avoid detection and to switch between different IP addresses as needed.
- The other answer choices do not align with the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
