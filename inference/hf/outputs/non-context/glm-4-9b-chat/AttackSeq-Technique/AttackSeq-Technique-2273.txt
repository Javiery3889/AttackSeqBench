1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Regin, a sophisticated malware, utilized encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of encrypted data blobs in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While Regin may have used encryption to obfuscate data, this choice does not directly relate to the use of non-traditional file storage areas.
   - B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow: This technique is about hijacking the execution flow of a process to bypass security controls. It does not directly relate to the use of encrypted data blobs or non-traditional file storage areas.
   - C: T1113-Screen Capture: This technique involves capturing the screen to gather information or to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the use of encrypted data blobs or non-traditional file storage areas.
   - D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing: This technique is about creating a new process that appears to be a legitimate process by hollowing out the body of a legitimate process. This could be used to hide the presence of Regin by storing its encrypted data blobs within a legitimate process, which aligns with the use of non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The use of encrypted data blobs in non-traditional file storage areas suggests an attempt to hide the data from detection.
   - T1055.012-Process Hollowing is a technique that can be used to hide the presence of malware by embedding it within a legitimate process, which is a plausible next step after evading detection through non-traditional storage.
   - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the use of non-traditional file storage areas or the evasion of detection through encryption.

Final Answer: D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing
