1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of events where TG-3279 reused network infrastructure between attacks by sharing IPs among domain names. This indicates that TG-3279 is using a method to maintain persistence across different attacks.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - TG-3279 reused network infrastructure between attacks by sharing IPs among domain names.
     - TG-3279 gained initial access using the tools 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploitation.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS
     - This technique involves collecting information about a target's infrastructure by monitoring DNS records. It does not directly relate to the initial access phase or the reuse of network infrastructure.
   - Answer Choice B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure
     - This technique involves acquiring or controlling the infrastructure used for the attack. While it is related to the reuse of network infrastructure, it does not directly precede the initial access phase.
   - Answer Choice C: T1595-Active Scanning
     - This technique involves actively scanning for vulnerabilities in a network. It is a plausible step before gaining initial access, as it would be necessary to identify potential entry points.
   - Answer Choice D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets
     - This technique involves obtaining or creating Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access to a network. It is not directly related to the initial access phase or the reuse of network infrastructure.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question suggests that TG-3279 first needed to identify potential entry points in the network, which would be done through active scanning.
   - The use of the tools 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploitation implies that TG-3279 was actively looking for vulnerabilities to exploit.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred before TG-3279 gained initial access is T1595-Active Scanning.

Final Answer: C: T1595-Active Scanning
