Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to an attack involving Cobalt Strike and a Listener being configured.
- The sequence of events is: 
  1. Listener configured within Cobalt Strike
  2. Communication with the C2 server enabled
  3. Reflective DLL injection to load beacon.dll
- We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between the first and third events.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter: This technique involves using a command-line interpreter to execute commands. It is not directly related to the configuration of a Listener or reflective DLL injection.
- B: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job: This technique is related to using container orchestration tools to execute jobs. It is not relevant to the described sequence.
- C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate. It is plausible that after configuring the Listener and before using reflective DLL injection, the attacker would use an application layer protocol to enable communication with the C2 server.
- D: T1056.001-Keylogging: This technique involves capturing keystrokes. It is not directly related to the configuration of a Listener or reflective DLL injection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events suggests that the attacker first configures the Listener, then enables communication with the C2 server, and finally uses reflective DLL injection to load beacon.dll.
- The most plausible technique that would occur after the Listener is configured and before reflective DLL injection is one that enables communication with the C2 server.
- T1059 and T1056 are not directly related to communication setup, and T1053 is unrelated to the context of the question.
- T1071, Application Layer Protocol, is the most relevant technique as it involves setting up communication channels, which is what would be needed after configuring the Listener and before using reflective DLL injection.

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
