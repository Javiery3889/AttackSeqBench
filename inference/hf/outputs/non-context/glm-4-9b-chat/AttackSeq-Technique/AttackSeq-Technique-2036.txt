1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where BlackEnergy 3 malware has gained initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the action taken by the malware after gaining initial access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job: This technique is related to containerization and orchestration, which is not directly related to the initial access phase after exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
   - B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure: This technique is about hiding the presence of infrastructure, which is more about persistence and lateral movement rather than the immediate actions after initial access.
   - C: T1204-User Execution: This technique refers to the execution of a file by a user, which is a plausible action after the malware has gained initial access. It could be the next step in the attack sequence, as the malware might need to execute itself to perform further actions.
   - D: T1622-Debugger Evasion: This technique is about evading detection by debuggers, which is typically a step taken to avoid being analyzed or detected by security tools, but it is not necessarily the immediate action after initial access.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial access phase involves the malware gaining a foothold in the system. After this, the malware would likely need to execute itself to carry out its intended malicious activities.
   - T1204-User Execution is the most plausible technique that would occur after the malware has gained initial access, as it involves the execution of the malware by a user, which is a common step in the infection process.
   - The other techniques (T1053.007, T1665, and T1622) are not as directly related to the immediate actions after initial access.

Final Answer: C: T1204-User Execution
