Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the XAgent app has already hidden its icon and is running in the background on iOS 7.
- The task is to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to collect geo-location data from the device after this initial action.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1132-Data Encoding - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection. While it could be used in an attack, it does not directly relate to collecting geo-location data.
- Answer Choice B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules - This technique involves using modules to authenticate users or systems. It is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.
- Answer Choice C: T1614-System Location Discovery - This technique is specifically designed to discover the location information of a system, which aligns with the task of collecting geo-location data.
- Answer Choice D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery - This technique involves identifying the owner or user of a system, which is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial action of the XAgent app hiding its icon and running in the background is a precursor to more malicious activities.
- The question specifically asks for the technique used to collect geo-location data, which is a specific type of information.
- Among the given answer choices, T1614-System Location Discovery is the most relevant technique as it directly addresses the collection of location information.

Final Answer: C: T1614-System Location Discovery
