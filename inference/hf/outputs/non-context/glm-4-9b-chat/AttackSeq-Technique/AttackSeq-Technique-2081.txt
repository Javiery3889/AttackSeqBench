Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where users are redirected to advertising pages or compromised sites that execute RIG exploits via malvertising.
- The next event mentioned is RIG EK (Exploit Kit) running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure.
- We need to identify which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the RIG EK runs the PowerShell script.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1648-Serverless Execution: This technique refers to the execution of code without the need for a file to be stored on disk. It is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script to fetch malware.
- B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution: This technique involves the exploitation of a client-side vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. While the RIG EK exploit is a form of client-side exploitation, it does not specifically describe the action of fetching malware from a C&C server.
- C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities: This technique refers to actions taken by an attacker to gain additional capabilities on the system, such as installing additional software or tools. This could include running a PowerShell script to fetch malware, which would be a plausible step after an exploit.
- D: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading: This technique involves loading a DLL file from an unexpected location to execute code. It is not directly related to the execution of a PowerShell script to fetch malware.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves an exploit (RIG EK) leading to the execution of a PowerShell script, which in turn fetches malware from a C&C server.
- T1588-Obtain Capabilities is the most plausible technique because it encompasses the idea of an attacker gaining additional capabilities, which could include fetching malware from a C&C server after an exploit.
- The other answer choices do not directly align with the described sequence of events.

Final Answer: C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
