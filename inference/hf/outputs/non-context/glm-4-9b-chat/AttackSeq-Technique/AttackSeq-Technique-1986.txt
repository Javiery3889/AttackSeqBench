1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary uses DLL Hijacking for initial execution. After that, the adversary maintains persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. DLL Hijacking (initial execution)
     2. Planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL (maintenance of persistence)

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance - This TTP is related to cloud services and involves reverting to a previous state of a cloud instance. It does not align with the described attack sequence of maintaining persistence on a local system.
   - Answer Choice B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information - This TTP involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is not directly related to maintaining persistence on a system after initial execution.
   - Answer Choice C: T1542.005-TFTP Boot - This TTP is about using TFTP to boot a system, which is not relevant to the described scenario of maintaining persistence on a local system.
   - Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - This TTP involves adding a program to the system's boot or logon process to ensure it runs automatically. This aligns with the described scenario of maintaining persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial TTP of DLL Hijacking is not directly related to persistence, but the second part of the question focuses on maintaining persistence.
   - Answer Choice A is about cloud services and does not relate to local persistence.
   - Answer Choice B is about file deobfuscation and is not related to persistence.
   - Answer Choice C is about booting a system using TFTP, which is not related to local persistence.
   - Answer Choice D is about adding a program to the boot or logon process, which is directly related to maintaining persistence on a local system after initial execution.

Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
