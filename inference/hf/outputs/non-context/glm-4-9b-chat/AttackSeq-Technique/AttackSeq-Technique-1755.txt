Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where Shuckworm has used malicious documents to execute their Pterodo backdoor and scheduled tasks to support their foothold.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Utilized malicious documents to execute Pterodo backdoor
  2. Scheduled tasks to support their foothold

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - This technique involves ensuring that malicious software runs at system startup or logon. This aligns with the need to keep the backdoor active across system reboots.
- Answer Choice B: T1098-Account Manipulation - This technique involves manipulating accounts to maintain persistence, but it does not directly address the need to keep the backdoor active across reboots.
- Answer Choice C: T1204.003-Malicious Image - This technique involves using malicious images to deliver payloads, but it does not address the need to keep the backdoor active across reboots.
- Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters to execute code, but it does not directly address the need to keep the backdoor active across reboots.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions that the backdoor needs to remain active across system reboots. This indicates that the TTP in question must be related to ensuring persistence at the system startup or logon phase.
- Answer Choice A (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) is the most relevant to the described scenario, as it directly addresses the need for the backdoor to remain active after system reboots.
- The other answer choices do not address the persistence requirement across reboots.

Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
