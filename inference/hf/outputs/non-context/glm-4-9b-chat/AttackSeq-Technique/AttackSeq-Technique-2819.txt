Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Derusbi has gathered system information about the victim's host for discovery.
- The next step in the sequence is to establish communication with the command and control (C2) server using HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1082-System Information Discovery - This TTP is about gathering information about the system, which has already occurred as per the question. This choice does not describe the communication step.
- Answer Choice B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication - This TTP refers to establishing bidirectional communication with the C2 server. While it is related to communication, it does not specify the use of HTTP POST requests.
- Answer Choice C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call - This TTP is about using asynchronous calls to communicate with a server, which is not directly related to HTTP POST requests.
- Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This TTP involves using application layer protocols to communicate, which includes HTTP POST requests as a specific example.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with gathering system information (T1082), and the next step is to establish communication with the C2 server.
- Answer Choice A is about discovery, not communication, so it is not the correct choice.
- Answer Choice B is about bidirectional communication but does not specify the use of HTTP POST requests.
- Answer Choice C is about asynchronous procedure calls, which is not directly related to HTTP POST requests.
- Answer Choice D is about using application layer protocols, which includes HTTP POST requests as a specific example, making it the most plausible TTP for the described communication step.

Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
