Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has already performed DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe and initiated further execution of its payload.
- The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique would ensure that T9000's components would run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion - This technique is about evading virtualization and sandbox environments, which is not directly related to ensuring components run at boot or logon.
- Answer Choice B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities - This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection, but it does not ensure components run at boot or logon.
- Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution - This technique is about ensuring that malicious components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot, which aligns with the goal described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, but it does not specifically address the requirement of ensuring components run at boot or logon.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question is asking for a technique that ensures T9000's components run with every user mode process after a system reboot. This is a clear indication that we are looking for a technique that involves autostart mechanisms.
- T1497 and T1036.003 are not directly related to the autostart requirement.
- T1543 is about system processes but does not guarantee that the components will run at boot or logon.
- T1547 is specifically about ensuring that malicious components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot, which is exactly what the question is asking for.

Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
