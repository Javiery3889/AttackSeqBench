1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Shamoon malware has already overwritten the disk's boot records as part of its defense evasion strategy.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Overwriting disk's boot records (defense evasion) and then the next technique to achieve the destruction of target data on disks.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: T1562-Impair Defenses - This technique involves actions that disable or degrade security controls. While overwriting the boot records could be seen as impairing defenses, it does not directly lead to the destruction of data on disks.
   - Answer Choice B: T1485-Data Destruction - This technique is specifically designed to delete or overwrite data on a disk, which aligns with the next step after defense evasion in the described attack sequence.
   - Answer Choice C: T1496.002-Bandwidth Hijacking - This technique is about intercepting and manipulating network traffic, which is not directly related to the destruction of data on disks.
   - Answer Choice D: T1484-Domain Policy Modification - This technique involves modifying security policies within a domain, which is not directly related to the destruction of data on disks.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial action of the malware is defense evasion, which is described as overwriting the disk's boot records.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to destroy the target data on disks.
   - Among the answer choices, T1485-Data Destruction is the technique that directly aligns with the goal of destroying data on disks after defense evasion.
   - The other answer choices do not match the described attack sequence or the goal of data destruction.

Final Answer: B: T1485-Data Destruction
