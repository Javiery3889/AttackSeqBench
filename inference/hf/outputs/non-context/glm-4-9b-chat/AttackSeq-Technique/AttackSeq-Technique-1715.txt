Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files for initial access.
- It also mentions the use of the double extension trick for defense evasion.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated communication with compromised systems by Mustang Panda.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the compromised system. It could be a plausible choice since communication is the focus of the question.
- Answer Choice B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding - This technique is about encoding data in non-standard ways to evade detection. While it could be part of the attack, it does not directly facilitate communication with the compromised system.
- Answer Choice C: T1010-Application Window Discovery - This technique is about discovering application windows on a system. It is not directly related to communication with the compromised system.
- Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing - This technique is about using phishing to deliver the initial access payload. Since the initial access has already been mentioned in the question, this choice is not relevant to the communication aspect.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is already covered by the spearphishing and the double extension trick, so we are looking for a technique that facilitates communication.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant to the communication aspect of the attack, as it involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the compromised system.
- The other answer choices are either not directly related to communication or are already covered by the initial access techniques mentioned.

Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
