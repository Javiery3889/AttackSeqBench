Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a backdoor has already collected machine information and screenshots and is now sending data to a Command and Control (C&C) server.
- The task is to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to enable communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting a publicly facing application to achieve objectives. It does not directly relate to querying external services or transmitting encrypted messages.
- B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive: This technique involves accessing data from a network shared drive. It does not involve querying external services or transmitting encrypted messages.
- C: T1102-Web Service: This technique involves using a web service to communicate with external systems. It could be used to query external services and transmit encrypted messages, which aligns with the question's description.
- D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools into the network. It does not directly relate to querying external services or transmitting encrypted messages.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario described in the question involves a backdoor that has already collected data and is now in the process of communicating with a C&C server.
- The communication needs to be secure and possibly involve querying external services, which suggests the use of a web service.
- T1102-Web Service is the most relevant technique as it involves using a web service for communication, which can include querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
