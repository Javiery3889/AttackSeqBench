Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events following the execution of a Raccoon stealer, which collects data such as system information, account data, and crypto wallet details.
- The next step in the sequence is that the stealer bypasses blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1566-Phishing - This technique involves delivering malicious content through phishing emails or messages. It does not directly relate to bypassing blocking or receiving C&C server addresses.
- B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information - This technique involves hiding malicious content within files or information to avoid detection. While it could be a part of the attack, it does not directly address the bypassing of blocking or receiving C&C server addresses.
- C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification - This technique involves modifying file and directory permissions to gain unauthorized access to files or directories. It could be used to bypass security controls that might block the stealer's network requests.
- D: T1010-Application Window Discovery - This technique involves discovering information about running applications, which is not directly related to bypassing blocking or receiving C&C server addresses.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the stealer bypassing blocking mechanisms to communicate with a C&C server. This suggests that the attacker would need to modify permissions or settings to allow the network requests to go through.
- T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification is the most plausible technique that would allow the stealer to bypass blocking by changing permissions that might be in place to prevent such network requests.
- The other answer choices do not directly address the bypassing of blocking or receiving C&C server addresses.

Final Answer: C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification
