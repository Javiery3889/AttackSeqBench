Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving TDrop2 evading detection through process hollowing and disguised payload retrieval for defense evasion.
- The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred as part of its activity to gather details about the infected system.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1106-Native API - This technique involves using native APIs to gather system information. It is a plausible technique for gathering details about the infected system after evading detection.
- Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery - This technique is specifically designed to gather information about the system, which aligns with the question's description of gathering details about the infected system.
- Answer Choice C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion - This technique is used to evade detection in virtualized environments or sandboxes, which is not directly related to gathering system details.
- Answer Choice D: T1560.002-Archive via Library - This technique is about extracting content from archives, which is not directly related to gathering system details.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves evading detection and gathering system details. The technique that is most directly related to gathering system details is T1082-System Information Discovery.
- T1106-Native API could also be a plausible choice, but T1082 is more specific to the task of gathering system information.
- T1497 and T1560.002 are not directly related to the task of gathering system details.

Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery
