1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving APT15 evading policy settings to disable the command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe, and then facilitating the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. APT15 evaded policy settings to disable the command prompt.
     2. Copied and patched cmd.exe.
     3. Persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable: This technique involves modifying the kernel to create a callback table that can be used to execute code at a later time. This does not directly relate to evading policy settings or facilitating the persistent installation of a backdoor.
   - B: T1562-Impair Defenses: This technique is about manipulating or disabling security tools and controls to avoid detection. This could be a plausible step after evading policy settings and before installing a backdoor, as it would help maintain persistence and avoid defenses.
   - C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption: This technique involves encrypting data in a way that it can be decrypted later. It is not directly related to evading policy settings or facilitating the persistent installation of a backdoor.
   - D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates: This technique involves stealing or forging certificates to bypass authentication mechanisms. It is not directly related to evading policy settings or facilitating the persistent installation of a backdoor.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question involves evading policy settings, which is a form of impairing defenses, and then installing a backdoor persistently. The most plausible technique that would occur after evading policy settings and before installing a backdoor would be one that helps to maintain persistence and avoid defenses.
   - T1562-Impair Defenses (B) is the most fitting choice because it aligns with the need to disable or manipulate security tools and controls, which would be necessary after evading policy settings and before installing a backdoor to ensure that the backdoor remains undetected and persistent.

Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses
