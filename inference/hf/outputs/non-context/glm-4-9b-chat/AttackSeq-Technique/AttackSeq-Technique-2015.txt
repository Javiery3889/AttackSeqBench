Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of BlackEnergy 3 plugins for credential harvesting and network discovery, followed by the enumeration of all networked devices on the ICS (Industrial Control Systems) network.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. Credential harvesting
  2. Network discovery
  3. Enumeration of networked devices on the ICS network

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1595-Active Scanning
  - Active scanning is the process of scanning a network to identify active hosts and services. It is a common step after discovering devices on a network but does not necessarily follow directly from credential harvesting and network discovery.
- Answer Choice B: T1018-Remote System Discovery
  - Remote System Discovery is the process of identifying and inventorying systems on a network. This aligns with the description of the question, as it follows network discovery and could be used to enumerate devices on the ICS network.
- Answer Choice C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance
  - Running a virtual instance is not directly related to the sequence of credential harvesting, network discovery, and device enumeration. It could be part of a broader attack, but it does not follow the sequence described in the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1087.004-Cloud Account
  - Cloud Account is not directly related to the sequence of credential harvesting, network discovery, and device enumeration. It is more about accessing cloud services, which is not mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves discovering and enumerating devices on a network, which is best aligned with T1018-Remote System Discovery.
- Active Scanning (T1595) is a possible step but not the most direct one following the described sequence.
- Running a virtual instance (T1564.006) and accessing a cloud account (T1087.004) are not directly related to the sequence of events described.

Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery
