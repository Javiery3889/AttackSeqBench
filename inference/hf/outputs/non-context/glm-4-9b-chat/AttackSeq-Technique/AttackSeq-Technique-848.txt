Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already discovered critical systems and gained valid credentials to enable legitimate access within the target network. The task is to identify which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur as the adversaries move across the network to further their objectives.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the scenario described:

A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
   - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to exfiltrate data. While it could be used to exfiltrate data from the network, it does not directly relate to moving across the network to further objectives.

B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification
   - This technique involves modifying domain or tenant policies to gain additional control over the network. This is a plausible technique as the attacker has already gained legitimate access and is looking to further their objectives by expanding their control within the network.

C: T1021.007-Cloud Services
   - This technique involves using cloud services to store data or to perform malicious activities. While it could be a part of the attacker's broader operations, it does not necessarily indicate movement across the network to further objectives.

D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
   - This technique involves exploiting remote services to gain access to additional systems. While this could be a step in the attack, it is more about gaining access rather than moving across the network to further objectives.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes an attacker who has already gained access to the network and is looking to further their objectives. The most plausible technique in this context is one that allows the attacker to expand their control over the network, which is what T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification suggests.
- The other techniques, while potentially used in a broader attack, do not directly align with the specific action of moving across the network to further objectives.

Final Answer: B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification
