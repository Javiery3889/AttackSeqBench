Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where CosmicDuke has already utilized a keylogger and a screenshotter to gather user activity information.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of a keylogger and a screenshotter.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration - This technique involves using automated tools to exfiltrate data from a victim's system. While it is a plausible step after gathering information, it does not directly follow the use of a keylogger and a screenshotter.
- Answer Choice B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL - This technique involves using a DLL to intercept network traffic. It is not directly related to the use of a keylogger and a screenshotter.
- Answer Choice C: T1560-Archive Collected Data - This technique involves archiving the data that has been collected. Given that CosmicDuke has already gathered user activity information using a keylogger and a screenshotter, it is logical that the next step would be to archive this data for further analysis or to prepare it for exfiltration.
- Answer Choice D: T1115-Clipboard Data - This technique involves accessing or modifying clipboard data. While it could be a subsequent action, it is not as directly related to the information gathered by a keylogger and a screenshotter as archiving the collected data.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of a keylogger and a screenshotter suggests that the attacker is interested in collecting information from the victim's system.
- The next logical step after collecting this information would be to archive it, as it would be useful for further analysis or for exfiltration purposes.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after using a keylogger and a screenshotter is to archive the collected data.

Final Answer: C: T1560-Archive Collected Data
