Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the exploitation of a CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposure), saving and executing a file, and then retrieving a second-stage PlugX file. The final step is the communication with Command and Control (C2) domains.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Exploiting CVE-2015-5119
  2. Saving and executing "%Temp%/Rdws.exe"
  3. Retrieving a second-stage PlugX file
  4. Communication with C2 domains (inocnation[.]com)

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1001.002-Steganography - This technique involves hiding data within other data. It does not directly relate to the communication with C2 domains.
- Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers. This is a plausible technique for the final step of the attack sequence.
- Answer Choice C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise - This technique refers to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in web browsers or plugins without any user interaction. It does not directly relate to the communication with C2 domains.
- Answer Choice D: T1005-Data from Local System - This technique involves using data from the local system to communicate with C2 servers. While it could be part of the attack, it does not specifically address the communication aspect.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first step of the attack sequence involves exploiting a vulnerability, which is not directly related to the communication with C2 domains.
- The second step involves executing a file, which is also not directly related to communication.
- The third step is the retrieval of a second-stage payload, which again does not inherently involve communication.
- The fourth and final step is the communication with C2 domains. Among the answer choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant to this step, as it involves using specific protocols to communicate with C2 servers.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
