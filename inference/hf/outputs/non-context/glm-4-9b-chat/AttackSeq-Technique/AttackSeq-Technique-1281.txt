Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) starting with Tropic Trooper using an exploit in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access.
- The next step in the sequence is the execution of a backdoor's installer, which leverages users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique refers to the use of encrypted communication channels to evade detection. It does not involve user interaction to trigger deployment.
- Answer Choice B: T1564.009-Resource Forking - This technique involves using a resource fork to store additional data in a file. It is not directly related to user interaction for deployment.
- Answer Choice C: T1648-Serverless Execution - This technique refers to the execution of code without the need for a traditional installer or deployment package. It does not involve user interaction for deployment.
- Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution - This technique involves the exploitation of a vulnerability that requires user interaction to execute the malicious payload. This aligns with the scenario described in the question, where the backdoor's installer is triggered by user action or interaction.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is gained through an exploit in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor, which is a known vector for delivering malicious payloads.
- The next step in the sequence is the deployment of a backdoor, which requires user interaction to trigger its execution.
- Tropic Trooper's actions suggest a targeted attack that relies on the user to execute the installer, which is consistent with the T1204-User Execution technique.
- The other answer choices do not involve user interaction for deployment and are therefore less likely to be the correct sequence.

Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
