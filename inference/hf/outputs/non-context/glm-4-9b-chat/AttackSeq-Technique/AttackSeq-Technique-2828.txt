1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence that includes "using file transfers and executing arbitrary commands for data gathering."
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable communication with C2 infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1005-Data from Local System: This technique refers to an attacker moving data from a local system to a different system. It does not directly relate to establishing communication with C2 infrastructure.
   - B: T1102-Web Service: This technique involves using a web service to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. Since the question mentions communication with C2 infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service, this choice is relevant.
   - C: T1547.008-LSASS Driver: This technique is related to using a malicious driver to interact with the LSASS process. It does not pertain to web services or C2 communication.
   - D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using non-standard protocols for communication. While it could be used for C2 communication, it does not specifically mention the use of a web service or Cloudflare Workers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves data gathering and communication with C2 infrastructure.
   - The use of a web service is mentioned in the question, which aligns with the T1102-Web Service technique.
   - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the use of a web service or the specific context of Cloudflare Workers.

Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
