Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of Conpee or Etso tools, the addition of scheduled system tasks using compromised credentials, and the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. TG-3279 relied on a few key hosts as beachheads running the Conpee or Etso tools.
  2. Added scheduled system tasks to key resources using compromised credentials from pwdump6.
  3. Used port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic for C2 communication.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols - This technique involves using email protocols for command and control. It does not align with the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.
- Answer Choice B: T1595-Active Scanning - This technique involves scanning for open ports and services. It does not directly relate to the use of a specific port for C2 communication.
- Answer Choice C: T1571-Non-Standard Port - This technique involves using non-standard ports for command and control communication. This aligns with the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which is a non-standard use of the port.
- Answer Choice D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure - This technique involves acquiring infrastructure for use in an attack. It does not directly relate to the use of a specific port for C2 communication.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves the use of a non-standard port (443) for C2 communication, which is a clear indication of using a technique that facilitates communication over non-standard ports.
- The answer choice that best aligns with this is T1571-Non-Standard Port, as it directly addresses the use of a non-standard port for command and control communication.

Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port
