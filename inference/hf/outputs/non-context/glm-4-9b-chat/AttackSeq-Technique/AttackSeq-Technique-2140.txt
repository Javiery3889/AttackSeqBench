1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where additional C2 (Command and Control) domains were identified through pivoting on Googlebot-like user agent strings. This indicates that the attackers used a method to communicate with the initial C2 domain, judystevenson[.]info, which was then discovered.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question involves the initial communication with the C2 domain.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1001.001-Junk Data: This technique involves using junk data to evade detection. It does not directly relate to establishing communication with a C2 domain.
   - B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks: This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. It is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 domain.
   - C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. This is a plausible method for establishing communication with an initial C2 domain.
   - D: T1566-Phishing: This technique involves using phishing to deceive users into providing sensitive information. While phishing can be used to gather information that could lead to identifying a C2 domain, it is not a direct method of establishing communication with the C2 domain itself.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question is asking for the technique that was used to establish communication with the initial C2 domain, judystevenson[.]info.
   - The answer choice that best aligns with this is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it directly involves using protocols to communicate with a C2 server.
   - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the establishment of communication with the C2 domain.

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
