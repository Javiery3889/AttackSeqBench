Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has downloaded a Shellcode script using PowerShell.
- The attacker is maintaining multi-beacon communication for evasion.
- The attacker is establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1654-Log Enumeration - This technique involves the attacker attempting to enumerate system logs to gather information. It does not directly relate to the described sequence of downloading a script, using PowerShell, or establishing secure communication via HTTP GET requests.
- Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter - This technique involves the use of command-line interpreters or scripting languages to execute commands. PowerShell is a command-line interpreter, so this choice aligns with the use of PowerShell to download the script. However, it does not address the secure communication aspect.
- Answer Choice C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography - This technique involves the use of symmetric encryption to establish secure communication channels. The question mentions that the attacker is using HTTP GET requests to establish secure communication, which could imply the use of encryption to secure the data being transmitted. This choice is the most relevant to the secure communication aspect of the question.
- Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique involves the use of encryption to establish a secure channel for data transmission. While this is similar to T1573.001, it is more general and does not specify the use of symmetric cryptography, which is mentioned in the question.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves the use of PowerShell to download a script, which is related to T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
- However, the key aspect of the question is the establishment of secure communication using HTTP GET requests, which suggests the use of encryption.
- Between T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography and T1573-Encrypted Channel, T1573.001 is more specific to the use of symmetric cryptography, which is a method of encryption that aligns with the secure communication aspect of the question.

Final Answer: C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography
