Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where an RMS (Remote Management System) tool is used to evade detection by using legitimate application functions.
- The next step in the sequence is the establishment of communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server located in Germany.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1204-User Execution - This technique refers to the execution of a file by a user, which is not directly related to the communication with a C2 server.
- Answer Choice B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS - This technique involves the use of fast-flux DNS to hide the C2 server's IP address, which could be used to establish communication with a C2 server but is not specific to the communication itself.
- Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a server, which is a plausible method for establishing communication with a C2 server.
- Answer Choice D: T1071.001-Web Protocols - This technique specifically mentions the use of web protocols, which could be a part of the communication process but is more specific to web-based communication.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on the communication aspect of the attack, not the initial execution of the RMS tool.
- While T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS is related to evading detection, it does not directly address the communication with the C2 server.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a broad category that includes various protocols, which could be used for communication with a C2 server.
- T1071.001-Web Protocols is a more specific technique that could be used for web-based communication, which is a plausible method for establishing communication with a C2 server, especially if the server is web-based.

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
