1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor for persistent communication over DNS.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor, which implies a method of establishing remote access to the network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1078.003-Local Accounts: This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to a system. It does not directly relate to remote access or the deployment of a backdoor.
   - B: T1133-External Remote Services: This technique involves using external remote services to establish a connection to a network. This could be a plausible method for deploying a backdoor that communicates over DNS.
   - C: T1078-Valid Accounts: This technique involves using valid credentials to access a system. While it could be a part of the attack, it does not specifically address the deployment of a backdoor for remote access.
   - D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts: This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access to resources. It is not directly related to the deployment of a backdoor for remote access.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor suggests that the attackers needed to establish a remote connection to the network.
   - T1133-External Remote Services is the technique that aligns best with the need for remote access, as it involves using external services to connect to a network.
   - The other techniques (T1078.003, T1078, and T1078.004) do not directly address the need for remote access through a backdoor.

Final Answer: B: T1133-External Remote Services
