Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 first harvests credentials via spear-phishing.
- It then employs OLDBAIT, which is a known malware used by APT28.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed APT28 to move deeper into victim networks after exploiting internet-facing servers.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain unauthorized access. While this could be a plausible step, it does not directly relate to the movement within the network after credential harvesting and exploitation of internet-facing servers.
- Answer Choice B: T1021.007-Cloud Services - This technique involves using cloud services to store data, host applications, or perform other actions. It is not directly related to moving deeper into a network after initial access.
- Answer Choice C: T1653-Power Settings - This technique involves manipulating power settings to change the behavior of a system, which is not directly related to lateral movement within a network.
- Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts - This technique is about hiding the presence of an attacker on a network, which is a common step in lateral movement after initial access. It is a plausible technique for APT28 to use after harvesting credentials and exploiting internet-facing servers.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing and the use of OLDBAIT, which are methods to gain initial access to a network.
- The next step in the attack sequence is to move deeper into the network, which requires evading detection and hiding the attacker's presence.
- T1210 and T1021 are not directly related to lateral movement within a network.
- T1653 is about manipulating system settings, which is not directly related to lateral movement.
- T1564, Hide Artifacts, is a technique that aligns with the need to move laterally within a network without being detected, which is a plausible step after initial access.

Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
