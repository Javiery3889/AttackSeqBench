Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor that has archived collected data in a custom storage file format.
- The task is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to transfer the data from the victim's system.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB
  - This technique involves using USB devices to exfiltrate data. However, the question does not mention anything about USB usage or physical access to the system, so this is less likely.

- Answer Choice B: T1129-Shared Modules
  - This technique refers to the use of shared modules to execute code. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data from the victim's system.

- Answer Choice C: T1590.001-Domain Properties
  - This technique involves using domain properties to gather information. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

- Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. Given that the SombRAT backdoor has archived data, it is likely that it would use a C2 channel to send the data back to the attacker. This is the most plausible technique based on the information provided.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the data was collected by the SombRAT backdoor and archived in a custom storage file format. This suggests that the data needs to be sent to the attacker.
- The most plausible method for sending the data from the victim's system to the attacker would be through a C2 channel, as this is a common method for malware to communicate with its operator.
- None of the other answer choices (T1052.001, T1129, T1590.001) directly relate to the exfiltration of data from the victim's system.

Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
