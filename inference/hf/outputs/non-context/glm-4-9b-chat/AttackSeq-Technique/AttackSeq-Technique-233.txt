Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a batch file is executed from a decoded CAB file, which in turn installs the main payload.
- The key aspect to focus on is the technique that facilitated the malware in executing the payload without triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1566-Phishing - This technique involves using phishing emails to deliver malicious content. It does not directly relate to executing a payload without triggering UAC.
- B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism - This technique involves exploiting a system's elevation control mechanisms to gain higher privileges. While it could be related to bypassing UAC, it does not specifically address the scenario of executing a payload without a UAC pop-up.
- C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs - This technique involves loading a DLL into the process of another application at startup, which can be used to bypass UAC. This is a plausible technique for executing a payload without triggering a UAC pop-up.
- D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data - This technique involves purchasing information to facilitate an attack. It is not directly related to executing a payload without triggering UAC.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario described in the question involves executing a payload without triggering UAC, which suggests that the technique used would likely involve bypassing UAC.
- T1546.010-AppInit DLLs is the most plausible technique for this scenario, as it can be used to load a DLL into another application's process at startup, potentially bypassing UAC.
- The other answer choices do not directly address the specific technique of bypassing UAC to execute a payload.

Final Answer: C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs
