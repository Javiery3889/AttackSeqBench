1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where 'stopedge.bat' is used to delete files ('versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs') as a defense evasion technique.
   - The question then asks if persistence is likely to be established by using kernel modules, referencing the techniques employed by Drovorub or Skidmap.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question involves defense evasion, which is a common step in an attack lifecycle to avoid detection and removal of the attacker's presence.
   - Kernel modules are a form of persistence that can be used by attackers to maintain a presence on a compromised system, as they can load at system startup and operate with high privileges.
   - Drovorub and Skidmap are both malware families that are known to use kernel modules for persistence. Drovorub is a modular backdoor that can use kernel modules to persist on a system, while Skidmap is a malware that targets Windows systems and can also use kernel modules for persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial action of deleting files is a defense evasion technique, which is a common step in establishing persistence.
   - Step 2: Persistence is a critical aspect of many attacks, as it allows the attacker to maintain access to the compromised system over time.
   - Step 3: Kernel modules are a sophisticated method of persistence, often used by advanced attackers or malware families like Drovorub and Skidmap.
   - Step 4: Given that the attacker has already taken steps to evade detection, it is plausible that they would also attempt to establish persistence on the system.

Final Answer: A: Yes
