Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving reconnaissance on medical infrastructure.
- The TTPs mentioned are:
  1. Using tools like masscan for reconnaissance.
  2. Identifying Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol.
  3. Identifying unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
- The question asks if it is likely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The discovery phase of an attack typically involves gathering information about the target environment to understand its structure, potential vulnerabilities, and to identify potential entry points.
- The TTPs provided in the question are focused on identifying specific systems and services within the target environment, such as Building Management systems and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
- Metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings is a broader type of information that can be retrieved during the discovery phase, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sequence of TTPs provided.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs provided does not include actions that would directly lead to the retrieval of metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings.
- The use of masscan and identifying specific systems does not inherently involve scanning for file metadata.
- Therefore, based on the information given, it is not likely that metadata retrieval is part of the described discovery phase.

Final Answer: B: No
