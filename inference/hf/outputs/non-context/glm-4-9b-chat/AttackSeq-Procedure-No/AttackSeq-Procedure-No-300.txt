Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where IEXPL0RE RAT (a Remote Access Trojan) gains initial access.
- The initial access method is through the delivery of password-protected archives containing disguised executables via social engineering.
- The question then asks if the malware is likely to use process hollowing to create and manipulate processes through sections of unmapped memory by reallocating that space with its malicious code.
- It also asks if the malware will employ a multi-stage unpacking process for defense evasion.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the malware is likely to use process hollowing and multi-stage unpacking after gaining initial access.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the malware is not likely to use process hollowing and multi-stage unpacking after gaining initial access.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- IEXPL0RE RAT is a known malware that is designed to provide remote access to an attacker's machine. It is common for such malware to use advanced techniques to evade detection and persistence on the compromised system.
- Process hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is replaced with malicious code, which is a common method used by malware to avoid detection and to execute its payload.
- Multi-stage unpacking is a technique where the malware is unpacked in multiple stages to avoid detection by antivirus software and other security measures.
- Given that the malware has already used social engineering to deliver its payload, it is plausible that it would use additional advanced techniques like process hollowing and multi-stage unpacking to further evade detection and establish persistence on the system.

Final Answer: A: Yes
