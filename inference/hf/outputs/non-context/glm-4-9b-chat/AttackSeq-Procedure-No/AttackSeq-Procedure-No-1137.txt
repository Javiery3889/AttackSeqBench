Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are part of an attack by the WINDSHIFT APT.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Using social media platforms for long-term monitoring via benign emails.
  2. Tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com.
  3. Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery pages.
  4. Using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages.
  5. Employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks if it is likely that the WINDSHIFT APT would perform the last two TTPs (emails mimicking legit password recovery pages and using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates) before the Reconnaissance phase.
- The Reconnaissance phase is typically the initial phase of an attack where the attacker gathers information about the target. It is not common for an attacker to engage in credential harvesting activities during the Reconnaissance phase, as these activities are more characteristic of the later phases of an attack, such as the Exploitation or Operation phases.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Reconnaissance phase is about gathering information, not about executing the final stages of an attack.
- Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery pages and using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages are both indicative of an attempt to steal credentials, which is more aligned with the Exploitation or Operation phases.
- Employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates is a technique that could be used to make the credential harvesting landing pages appear more legitimate, but it is not a Reconnaissance phase activity.

Final Answer: B: No
