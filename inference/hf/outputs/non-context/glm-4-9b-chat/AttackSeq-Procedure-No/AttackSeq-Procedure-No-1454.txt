Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence that starts with the Initial Access phase, where emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT are sent.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The Initial Access phase is the first stage of the attack lifecycle, where the adversary gains a foothold in the target environment.
- The Resource Development phase is the second stage, where the adversary establishes a presence, collects information, and prepares for further exploitation.
- Custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor are sophisticated tools that are often used to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system, which is characteristic of the Resource Development phase.

Given that the adversary has already established an initial access point with a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT, it is plausible that they would use additional sophisticated tools like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor during the Resource Development phase to further their objectives.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Initial Access phase has been achieved by sending emails with a malicious PDF link.
- The Resource Development phase typically involves the use of more advanced tools to maintain access and control.
- Custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor are advanced tools that are consistent with the Resource Development phase.
- Therefore, it is likely that the adversary would use these tools during the Resource Development phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
