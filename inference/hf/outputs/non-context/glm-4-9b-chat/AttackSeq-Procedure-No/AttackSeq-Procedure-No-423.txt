Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Initial access through phishing emails with a malicious Word document.
  2. Execution of an encoded PowerShell script.
  3. Retrieval of the PowerShell script via a VBS macro.
  4. Downloading payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the sequence described in the question is not likely to occur.

To evaluate the answer choices, let's consider the typical attack sequence:
1. A phishing email is sent with a malicious Word document.
2. The malicious Word document contains a macro that is enabled by the user, which could be a VBS macro.
3. The VBS macro retrieves the PowerShell script from a remote server.
4. The PowerShell script executes on the victim's machine.
5. The PowerShell script then downloads additional payloads, which could include Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

The sequence described in the question seems to be a plausible sequence of events in a cyber attack. The PowerShell script would typically execute after it is retrieved and before it can download additional payloads. Therefore, the sequence described in the question is likely.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is gained through a phishing email, which is a common method for initial compromise.
- The malicious Word document contains a macro, which is a known method to execute code silently on the victim's machine.
- The PowerShell script is retrieved via a VBS macro, which is a plausible method for retrieving the script from a remote server.
- The PowerShell script executes before it can download additional payloads, which is a logical sequence in an attack.
- The subsequent download of payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware is a plausible outcome of a multi-stage attack.

Final Answer: A: Yes
