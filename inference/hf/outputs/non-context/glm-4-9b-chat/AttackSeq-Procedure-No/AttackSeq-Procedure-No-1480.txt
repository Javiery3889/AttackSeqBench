1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of Seaduke, a malware that retrieves detailed bot/system information and deletes itself using a 'seppuku' function.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Seaduke will calculate the command-and-control (C2) port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that Seaduke indeed calculates the C2 port using the described method.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that Seaduke does not calculate the C2 port using the described method.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Seaduke retrieves detailed bot/system information. This is a common TTP for malware to gather information about the compromised system.
   - Step 2: Seaduke deletes itself using a 'seppuku' function. This is an unusual but plausible TTP, as some malware is designed to self-destruct after its primary task is completed.
   - Step 3: The question then asks if Seaduke calculates the C2 port using a specific mathematical formula involving the IP address. This is a more specific TTP that would be part of the malware's communication strategy.
   - Step 4: The formula described is not a standard method for calculating C2 ports. Typically, C2 ports are determined by the attacker, hardcoded into the malware, or derived from other methods that are not as simplistic as the one described.
   - Step 5: Given that the formula is not a standard or typical method for calculating C2 ports, it is less likely that Seaduke would use it.

Final Answer: B: No
