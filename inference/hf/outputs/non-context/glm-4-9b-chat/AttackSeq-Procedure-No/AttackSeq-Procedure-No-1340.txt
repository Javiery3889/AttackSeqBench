Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events involving the use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files by DDOS C2 servers.
- It then asks whether it is likely that attackers rebooted the target system after completing wiping processes.
- The context of the attack is against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and causing a 'total failure' of Next Media's network.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question are:
  1. Use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files.
  2. Wiping processes (which could imply data deletion or system preparation).
  3. Potential reboot of the target system.
  4. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and Next Media's network.

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This suggests that the attackers rebooted the system after the wiping processes were complete.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This suggests that the attackers did not reboot the system after the wiping processes were complete.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files and the wiping processes could indicate a preparation phase for an attack, possibly to remove evidence or to ensure that the system is in a certain state before the next phase of the attack.
- Rebooting the system after wiping processes could be a plausible step if the attackers wanted to ensure that any remaining data or processes related to the attack were cleared or that the system was in a known state for the next phase.
- However, rebooting the system is not a necessary step for launching DDoS attacks. In fact, rebooting could potentially disrupt the attack or alert the target that an attack is in progress.
- The question does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that rebooting was part of the attack sequence, but it is a plausible step given the context of preparing the system for the next phase of the attack.

Final Answer: A: Yes
