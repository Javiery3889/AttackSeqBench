1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where the CostaRicto Campaign has established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Protocol tunneling over DNS
     - Protocol tunneling over HTTP
   - The question then asks if the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign has already established communication channels using DNS and HTTP, which are non-standard protocols for command and control (C2) communication.
   - Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers may continue to use non-standard protocols for exfiltration as well.
   - Answer Choice A: Yes, suggests that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
   - Answer Choice B: No, suggests that the SombRAT backdoor will not exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CostaRicto Campaign has shown a preference for non-standard protocols for C2 communication.
   - Step 2: It is common for attackers to use the same or similar protocols for exfiltration as they do for C2 communication to maintain consistency and avoid detection.
   - Step 3: HTTPS and SMTPS are standard protocols for secure communication, but if the attackers have already shown a preference for non-standard protocols, it is plausible that they would continue to use a non-standard protocol for exfiltration.
   - Conclusion: Based on the information provided and the typical behavior of attackers, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

Final Answer: A: Yes
