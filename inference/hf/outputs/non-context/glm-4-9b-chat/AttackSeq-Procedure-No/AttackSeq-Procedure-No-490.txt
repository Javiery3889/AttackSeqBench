1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will follow a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) which includes stealing application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links, followed by collecting system information, and then probing files as part of the Discovery phase.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Stealing application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links
     2. Collecting system information
     3. Probing files

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that it is likely FamousSparrow will follow the described sequence of TTPs.
     - The sequence described is a plausible sequence for an attacker to follow during the Discovery phase of an attack. The attacker might first gain initial access by phishing for access tokens, then gather information about the system, and finally probe for sensitive files.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that it is not likely FamousSparrow will follow the described sequence of TTPs.
     - While it is possible for an attacker to follow a different sequence, the sequence described is a common and plausible approach for an attacker to take during the Discovery phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Discovery phase is an early stage in an attack where the attacker is trying to understand the target environment.
   - Step 2: Phishing for application access tokens is a common method for attackers to gain initial access to a system.
   - Step 3: Once access is gained, collecting system information is a logical next step to understand the environment better.
   - Step 4: Probing files is a typical action to identify potential targets of interest within the system.
   - Step 5: Given the plausibility of the sequence, Answer Choice A aligns with the typical behavior of an attacker during the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
