Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving malware named Longhorn.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.
  2. Configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C (Command and Control) communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that Longhorn's malware will indeed configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol after communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that Longhorn's malware will not configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol after communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question implies that the malware has already established communication externally for exfiltration, which is a common TTP for evading detection.
- The next step in the sequence is to configure a specific domain and IP address combination for C&C communication. This is a common practice to avoid detection by using different C&C channels for each target.
- Using HTTPS and a custom cryptographic protocol further enhances the malware's ability to avoid detection by encrypting the communication and using a secure protocol.
- Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is plausible that Longhorn's malware would follow these steps to maintain persistence and evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
