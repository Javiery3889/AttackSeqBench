Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario involving the Sednit group's malware.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  1. Launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.
  2. Targeting IP ranges for vulnerability scanning.
  3. This vulnerability scanning is related to government and critical infrastructure organizations.
  4. This activity occurs during the Discovery phase of an attack.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning after establishing initial access with malicious documents containing VBA macros.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the Sednit group's malware will target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning after establishing initial access with malicious documents containing VBA macros.

The Sednit group, also known as Cozy Bear, is known for its sophisticated tactics, which often include initial access via spear-phishing emails with malicious documents containing VBA macros. After establishing initial access, they typically move laterally within the network to gather intelligence. Targeting IP ranges for vulnerability scanning is a plausible step in this process, as it could be used to identify potential entry points or weaknesses in the network that could be exploited further.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Sednit group's initial access method is consistent with the first TTP mentioned in the question.
- The group's history suggests they are likely to conduct reconnaissance on the network after initial access, which aligns with the second TTP.
- The third TTP specifies that the vulnerability scanning is related to government and critical infrastructure organizations, which is a common target for such groups.
- The fourth TTP indicates that this activity occurs during the Discovery phase, which is a typical phase in the attack lifecycle where reconnaissance is conducted.

Given the Sednit group's tactics and the sequence of TTPs described, it is plausible that they would target IP ranges for vulnerability scanning after establishing initial access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
