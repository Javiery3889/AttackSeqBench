Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker, specifically the WINDSHIFT APT (Advanced Persistent Threat).
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Using fake social media personas to gather identifiable information.
  2. Employing social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents as part of reconnaissance.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after gathering information and stealing data from social media mobile apps, the WINDSHIFT APT will access external victim-owned websites for target development.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the WINDSHIFT APT will not access external victim-owned websites for target development after the described reconnaissance activities.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial TTPs involve gathering information and stealing data from social media platforms, which are internal to the victim's environment.
- The next logical step in the reconnaissance phase would typically involve using this information to understand the victim's network and potential entry points.
- Accessing external victim-owned websites for target development would not be a typical next step in this sequence, as it does not directly leverage the information gathered from the internal social media platforms.
- Instead, the attacker might look for vulnerabilities within the internal network, use the stolen data to craft spear-phishing emails, or look for other internal systems to exploit.

Final Answer: B: No
