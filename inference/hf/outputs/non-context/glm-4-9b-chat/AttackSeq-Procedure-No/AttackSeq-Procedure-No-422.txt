1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an observed campaign that starts with phishing emails.
   - The phishing emails contain a malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
   - The campaign aims to exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Phishing emails, malicious file (Richard_Johnson.doc), and exploitation of CVE-2018-13379.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access through the phishing emails.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the observed campaign will not exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access through the phishing emails.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question indicates that the campaign starts with phishing emails, which is a common initial access vector (IAV) in cyber attacks.
   - The malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file is likely a document containing a macro or a script that, when opened, executes the initial payload on the victim's system.
   - The next step in the attack sequence would be for the payload to attempt to exploit a known vulnerability, such as CVE-2018-13379, which is a vulnerability in FortiOS devices.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with a typical attack lifecycle, where initial access is gained, followed by exploitation of a known vulnerability.

Given that the question describes a sequence of TTPs that aligns with a common attack pattern, it is plausible that the campaign would exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access through the phishing emails.

Final Answer: A: Yes
