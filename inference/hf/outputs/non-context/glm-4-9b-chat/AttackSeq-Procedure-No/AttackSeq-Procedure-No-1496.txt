Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with an attack by the group Charming Kitten.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Resource Development: Charming Kitten created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks whether it is likely that Charming Kitten gathered targeted individuals' e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase.
- The Reconnaissance phase typically involves gathering information about the target environment to understand the attack surface and identify potential targets. This phase often includes activities such as open-source intelligence gathering, social engineering, and scanning for vulnerabilities.
- Open source research and website contact forms are both plausible methods for gathering information during the Reconnaissance phase.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Given that the Reconnaissance phase is about gathering information to understand the target, it is reasonable to assume that Charming Kitten would use methods such as open source research and website contact forms to gather e-mail addresses of targeted individuals.
- Open source research can provide a wealth of information about potential targets, including e-mail addresses that are publicly available.
- Website contact forms are another source of information that could be used to gather e-mail addresses of individuals who might be interested in the fake services provided by Charming Kitten.

Final Answer: A: Yes
