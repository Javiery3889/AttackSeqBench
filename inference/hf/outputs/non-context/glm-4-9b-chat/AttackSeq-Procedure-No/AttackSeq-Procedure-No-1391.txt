1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where FIN13 is conducting an attack. The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     a. Dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
     b. Gathering information on network and host configurations.
     c. Using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that FIN13 would perform the TTPs in the order given: dump LSASS process memory, gather information, and use native OS binaries for reconnaissance.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that FIN13 would perform the TTPs in the order given.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Dumping LSASS process memory is a common method used by attackers to obtain credentials, as the LSASS process is responsible for handling user authentication and credentials in Windows systems.
   - Step 2: After obtaining credentials, an attacker would typically use them to gain access to the network and host configurations to understand the environment better.
   - Step 3: Using native OS binaries for reconnaissance is a plausible step, as attackers often use legitimate tools to avoid detection and to gather information without raising alarms.
   - Step 4: The sequence described in the question is a logical progression of steps that an attacker might take to establish a presence on a network and gather intelligence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
