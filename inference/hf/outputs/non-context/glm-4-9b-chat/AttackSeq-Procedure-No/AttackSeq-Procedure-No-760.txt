Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where attackers are using images in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems.
- The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers will use a keylogger plugin to gather account credentials or verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for the 2-step verification code.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The use of images in phishing emails is a technique to evade text-based security measures, such as Google's Safe Browsing technology, which can detect and block malicious URLs or text-based phishing attempts.
- If the attackers are using images, it suggests that they are trying to mimic legitimate emails as closely as possible to avoid detection.
- A keylogger plugin is a tool that can silently record keystrokes, which could include account credentials and 2-step verification codes.
- Verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code would require a more sophisticated attack, possibly involving a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack or a compromised account to initiate the verification process.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Given that the attackers are already using a technique (using images) to bypass security measures, it is plausible that they would also use a keylogger plugin to capture credentials without alerting the user.
- A keylogger plugin is a straightforward method to capture credentials without the need for real-time interaction, which is more complex and risky for the attacker.
- Therefore, it is more likely that the attackers would use a keylogger plugin rather than attempt a more complex real-time verification process.

Final Answer: A: Yes
