1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving attackers collecting Instagram credentials through phishing sites and then potentially stopping specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Collecting victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites.
     2. Stopping specific services related to backups.
     3. Locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This suggests that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.
     - This could be a plausible step for attackers to ensure that the victims' data is not recoverable from backups, which could be a way to increase the impact of the attack or to make the attack more difficult to reverse.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This suggests that the attackers will not stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.
     - This could be less plausible because stopping backup services could be a strategic move to prevent the victims from recovering their data, which might be a goal of the attackers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The attackers have already collected Instagram credentials, which indicates they have a level of access to the victims' accounts.
   - Step 2: Stopping backup services could be a way to ensure that the victims cannot recover their data, which might be a goal of the attackers.
   - Step 3: Locking out the original owners by changing the passwords is a common step in account takeovers to maintain control of the compromised accounts.
   - Step 4: Given the potential for data exfiltration and the desire to maintain control, stopping backup services before locking out the original owners could be a plausible step in the attack sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
