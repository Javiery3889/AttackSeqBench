Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the Cosmic Banker malware. The sequence includes:
  1. Accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.
  2. Targeting Mexican financial institution users.
  3. Displaying text related to an alleged data update request.
  4. Executing a malicious batch file.
  5. Running a PowerShell script at memory level.
  6. Enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely to be used by Cosmic Banker malware.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely to be used by Cosmic Banker malware.

To evaluate the plausibility of the sequence, let's consider the typical behavior of Cosmic Banker malware:
- Cosmic Banker is a known banking Trojan that targets financial institutions. It is designed to steal credentials and other sensitive information.
- It is plausible that Cosmic Banker would target Mexican financial institution users, as it is a targeted attack.
- Displaying a message related to an alleged data update request is a common phishing technique used by malware to trick users into providing their credentials.
- Executing a malicious batch file and running a PowerShell script at memory level are common methods for malware to evade detection and persistence.
- Creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks are also common persistence mechanisms used by malware.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the typical behavior of Cosmic Banker malware, which is designed to target financial institutions, use phishing techniques, and employ persistence mechanisms.
- The TTPs are consistent with the capabilities and objectives of Cosmic Banker, which is to steal credentials and maintain a presence on the compromised system.

Final Answer: A: Yes
