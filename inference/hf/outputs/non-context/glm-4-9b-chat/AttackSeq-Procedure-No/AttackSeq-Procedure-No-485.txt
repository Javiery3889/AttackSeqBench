Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
- The attacker is likely to perform actions in the Discovery phase of an attack.
- The actions mentioned in the question are: 
  1. Read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server.
  2. Collect system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the attacker will read file contents and exfiltrate them before collecting system information.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attacker will not read file contents and exfiltrate them before collecting system information.

Given the typical sequence of actions in the Discovery phase of an attack, the attacker would first gather as much information as possible about the system and its environment. This includes collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types. After this initial discovery, the attacker might then look for additional information, such as file contents, which could be relevant for further exploitation or exfiltration.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Discovery phase is about understanding the environment and the potential points of interest for further exploitation.
- It is common for an attacker to first collect system information to understand the layout of the network and the potential targets.
- After collecting system information, the attacker may then look for additional data that could be useful for further actions, such as exfiltration.
- Therefore, it is more plausible that the attacker would collect system information first and then read file contents for exfiltration.

Final Answer: B: No
