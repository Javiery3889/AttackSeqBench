Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving impersonation, phishing, and credential collection.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Impersonating technical support or friends
  2. Delivering phishing messages claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges
  3. Locking out the original owners by changing account passwords
  4. Using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords before using phishing sites to collect credentials.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attackers will not lock out the original owners by changing account passwords before using phishing sites to collect credentials.

To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice:
- The initial TTPs involve social engineering to deliver phishing messages. This is a common method to deceive users into providing sensitive information.
- Locking out the original owners by changing account passwords is a plausible step because it would prevent the legitimate user from accessing their account, thus making it easier for the attackers to proceed with their attack.
- After locking out the original owners, the attackers would likely use phishing sites to collect additional credentials, as this is a common method to gather information from unsuspecting users.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers' goal is to gain access to the victims' accounts and collect their credentials.
- Impersonating technical support or friends and delivering phishing messages are initial steps to deceive the victims.
- Locking out the original owners by changing account passwords is a plausible step to ensure that the attackers have control over the accounts.
- Using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials is a logical next step to gather more information.

Final Answer: A: Yes
