1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     - Spear-phishing
     - Exploiting CVE-2015-5119 (Adobe Flash exploit)
     - Downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes
     - Installation of a payload embedded in a GIF image

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that the Flash file 'show.swf' will perform the NTLM downgrade to capture NTLM hashes before installing the payload.
     - The sequence of events described in the question does not explicitly state that the NTLM downgrade is part of the attack, but it is a plausible step in a more complex attack scenario.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that the Flash file 'show.swf' will not perform the NTLM downgrade to capture NTLM hashes before installing the payload.
     - This is also a plausible scenario, as the question does not provide enough information to confirm that the NTLM downgrade is part of the attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a Flash exploit to gain initial access. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - The next step in the question is the installation of a payload, which is often the goal of an attack. The payload could be anything from a backdoor to a more sophisticated piece of malware.
   - The NTLM downgrade to capture NTLM hashes is a technique that can be used to steal credentials, which is a common goal in many attacks. However, it is not a standard step in all attacks, and the question does not explicitly state that this is part of the attack.
   - The presence of a GIF image with embedded shellcode suggests that the payload is likely to be delivered in a non-traditional manner, which is consistent with the complexity of the attack described.

Given the information provided and the plausibility of each answer choice, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Flash file 'show.swf' will perform the NTLM downgrade to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

Final Answer: A: Yes
