Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack. The sequence is as follows:
  1. Social engineering in malicious documents to trick victims into enabling macros for payload activation.
  2. Creating a pipe to enable inter-process communication.
  3. Achieving persistence by adding script paths to the task scheduler.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the initial social engineering and payload activation, the campaign will proceed to create a pipe for inter-process communication and then add script paths to the task scheduler for persistence.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the campaign will not create a pipe for inter-process communication and will not add script paths to the task scheduler for persistence after the initial social engineering and payload activation.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question follows a typical attack pattern where the initial infection vector (social engineering) is used to deliver the payload. Once the payload is activated, the attacker would typically look to establish a more persistent presence on the compromised system.
- Creating a pipe for inter-process communication is a method that can be used to maintain a connection between the attacker's tool and the compromised system, allowing for ongoing command and control (C2) communication.
- Adding script paths to the task scheduler is a common method for achieving persistence, as it allows the attacker's payload to execute at system startup or at specified intervals.
- Given that the question describes a sequence of steps that are commonly used in cyber attacks to establish persistence, it is plausible that the campaign would create a pipe for inter-process communication and add script paths to the task scheduler.

Final Answer: A: Yes
