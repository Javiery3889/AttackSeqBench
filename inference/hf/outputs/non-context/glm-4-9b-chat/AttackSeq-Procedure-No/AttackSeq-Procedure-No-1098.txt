1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that CosmicDuke is likely to use. The sequence includes:
     a. Searching removable drives.
     b. Skipping certain file types during collection.
     c. Compressing output data generated by command execution.
     d. Exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to compress the output data using a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm before exfiltrating it.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to compress the output data using a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm before exfiltrating it.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - CosmicDuke is known to be a sophisticated malware that has been used in targeted attacks. It is common for such malware to compress data before exfiltration to reduce the size of the data being transferred, which can help avoid detection and reduce the load on the network.
   - The LZW algorithm is a well-known compression algorithm that is efficient for compressing text data, which is often the case with the output of command execution.
   - While the question specifies a "custom implementation" of the LZW algorithm, it does not provide any information that would suggest CosmicDuke would not use such an implementation. Custom implementations can be used to evade detection by anti-virus software that may be looking for known compression algorithms.
   - Exfiltrating data via FTP is a common method for malware to transfer data to a remote server, and it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use this method.

Based on the above reasoning, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would compress the output data using a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm before exfiltrating it.

Final Answer: A: Yes
