Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where WastedLocker ransomware is deployed using PsExec, which is a tool that allows for remote execution of processes on Windows systems. The ransomware is used to stop services and disable Windows Defender, which are actions typically associated with the Defense Evasion phase of an attack.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The Defense Evasion phase is focused on evading detection and mitigation efforts. Stopping services and disabling Windows Defender are common techniques used during this phase.
- The Impact phase is where the attacker aims to achieve the desired outcome of the attack, which in the case of ransomware, is to encrypt files and demand a ransom.
- Deleting system volume shadow copies is a technique that can prevent victims from restoring their files before the ransomware has encrypted them. This action is more aligned with the Impact phase than the Defense Evasion phase.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is:
  1. Deployment of WastedLocker ransomware using PsExec.
  2. Stopping services and disabling Windows Defender (Defense Evasion).
  3. Deleting system volume shadow copies (Impact phase).
- The third action is clearly an Impact phase TTP, as it is aimed at achieving the ransomware's goal of encrypting files and making them unrecoverable.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the ransomware would perform this action after deploying and evading defenses.

Final Answer: A: Yes
