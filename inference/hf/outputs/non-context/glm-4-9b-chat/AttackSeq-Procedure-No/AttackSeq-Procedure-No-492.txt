1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where a threat actor has used a custom screenshot tool (Harvester) to capture and archive screenshots for collection.
   - The question then asks if the custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon) and Cobalt Strike Beacon are likely to utilize the FTP protocol for command and control (C2) communication.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Harvester is a tool used for collecting information, which in this context, includes capturing screenshots. This suggests that the attacker is interested in gathering visual information from the compromised system.
   - Backdoor.Graphon is a known backdoor that provides remote access to the attacker.
   - Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing tool that includes a beacon, which is used for C2 communication.
   - The FTP protocol is an older protocol that is not commonly used for C2 communication due to its lack of encryption and potential for detection. Modern C2 communications often use more secure protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or other encrypted channels.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Harvester is used for information collection, which does not inherently dictate the C2 protocol used by the backdoor or beacon.
   - Step 2: Backdoor.Graphon is a backdoor, and while it can use various protocols for C2, it is not specified in the question that it uses FTP.
   - Step 3: Cobalt Strike Beacon is designed for C2 communication and is known to use more sophisticated and secure protocols.
   - Step 4: Given the context of modern cybersecurity practices, it is unlikely that both a backdoor and a beacon would use FTP for C2 communication due to its lack of security features.

Final Answer: B: No
