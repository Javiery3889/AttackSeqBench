1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where a group has already used stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group will deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the group will first scan for vulnerabilities before deploying public exploits.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the group will deploy public exploits without first scanning for vulnerabilities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The group has already gained persistent access using stolen credentials. This indicates that they have a level of control over the compromised systems.
   - Step 2: The group's next action is to deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services. This implies that they are looking to exploit known vulnerabilities.
   - Step 3: The question specifies that the group will conduct vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses. This is a proactive step that would typically be taken to identify potential targets for exploitation.
   - Step 4: Given that the group has already compromised systems and is looking to exploit vulnerabilities, it is reasonable to assume that they would want to ensure that the targets are indeed vulnerable before deploying exploits.
   - Step 5: Therefore, it is likely that the group would conduct vulnerability scanning before deploying public exploits.

Final Answer: A: Yes
