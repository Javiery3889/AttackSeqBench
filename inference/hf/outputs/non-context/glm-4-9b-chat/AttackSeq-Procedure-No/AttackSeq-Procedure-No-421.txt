Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an observed campaign that starts with phishing emails.
- The campaign is expected to execute VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document.
- The campaign is also expected to gain initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the VBS macros are executed from the embedded Microsoft Word document before gaining initial access through the phishing emails.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the VBS macros are not executed from the embedded Microsoft Word document before gaining initial access through the phishing emails.

Given the typical attack sequence for phishing campaigns that involve Microsoft Word documents with malicious macros, the following steps are often taken:
1. The attacker sends a phishing email with a malicious attachment, such as 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
2. The user opens the attachment, which is a Microsoft Word document.
3. The document contains a macro that is designed to execute when enabled by the user.
4. The user enables the macro, which then executes the VBS script or other malicious code.
5. The malicious code performs actions such as installing a backdoor or other malware on the user's system, thereby gaining initial access.

Based on this typical sequence, the VBS macros are executed after the user has opened the malicious Word document and enabled the macro. Therefore, the sequence described in the question is not typical.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The typical sequence involves the user enabling the macro after opening the malicious Word document, not before gaining initial access.
- The question suggests that the VBS macros are executed before gaining initial access, which is not in line with the typical attack sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence based on the typical attack pattern is that the VBS macros are executed after the user has gained initial access through the phishing emails.

Final Answer: B: No
