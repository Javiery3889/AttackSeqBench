1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving FamousSparrow, which is likely a cyber threat actor or group.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question are:
     a. Exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes.
     b. Utilize SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server.
     c. Use HTTPS protocol for communication.
     d. Employ multi-byte XOR keys for Command and Control.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that FamousSparrow is indeed likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method, which aligns with the first TTP mentioned in the question.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that FamousSparrow is not likely to exfiltrate data in the described manner.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question provides a specific sequence of actions that FamousSparrow is expected to take. The first TTP is about exfiltrating data at a specific frequency (every 10 minutes), which is a common behavior for malware to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data regularly.
   - The second TTP mentions the use of SparrowDoor, which is a known tool or method used by the actor. This is consistent with the actor's behavior.
   - The third TTP specifies the use of HTTPS for communication, which is a secure protocol and is often used by cyber threat actors to hide their activities from detection.
   - The fourth TTP indicates the use of multi-byte XOR keys for Command and Control, which is a method to encrypt communications, making them harder to intercept and analyze.
   - The answer choices do not provide information about the scheduled transfer method, but the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not necessarily imply that the exfiltration is scheduled. It simply states that it happens every 10 minutes, which could be due to a scheduled task or another method.

Given the information provided in the question and the lack of additional context about the scheduled transfer method, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the information given is that FamousSparrow would exfiltrate data every 10 minutes. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
