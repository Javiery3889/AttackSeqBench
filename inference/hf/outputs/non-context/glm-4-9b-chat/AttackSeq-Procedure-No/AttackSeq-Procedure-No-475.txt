Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Infamous Chisel malware has already impacted the system by replacing the legitimate netd service.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: 
  1. Infamous Chisel malware impacts the system by replacing the legitimate netd service.
  2. The malware automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals.
  3. The exfiltration uses a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that it is likely the malware will perform the described actions. However, the question does not provide any information about the malware's capabilities or behavior beyond replacing the netd service.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that it is not likely the malware will perform the described actions. This could be because the question does not provide any information about the malware's exfiltration capabilities, and it is generally not common for malware to automatically exfiltrate files without some form of command and control (C2) communication or additional triggers.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the malware will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
- It is common for malware to require some form of C2 communication to initiate exfiltration, and the question does not mention any such communication.
- Therefore, without additional context or information about the malware's behavior, it is not plausible to assume that it will automatically exfiltrate files in the manner described.

Final Answer: B: No
