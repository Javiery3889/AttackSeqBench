Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where Smooth Operator malware has already exfiltrated data using a HTTP GET request.
- The follow-up question asks whether the malware is likely to establish communication with its Command and Control (C2) servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The question implies that the malware has already used a HTTP GET request for exfiltration, which is a common method for exfiltrating data without raising suspicion.
- HTTPS is a secure protocol that encrypts the communication between the client and the server, making it harder for an attacker to intercept and read the data.
- A custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation would add an additional layer of security to the data being sent to the C2 server, making it even more difficult for security analysts to detect the data traffic.

Given the context of the question, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would take steps to ensure the security of its C2 communication. This would include using HTTPS for secure communication and a custom encoding algorithm for data obfuscation.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware has already demonstrated the ability to use HTTP GET requests for exfiltration, indicating a level of sophistication.
- It is common for sophisticated malware to use HTTPS for C2 communication to avoid detection.
- Using a custom data encoding algorithm would further enhance the malware's ability to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
