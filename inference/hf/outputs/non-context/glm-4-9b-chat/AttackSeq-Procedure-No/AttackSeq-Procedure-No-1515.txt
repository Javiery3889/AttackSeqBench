Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where attackers have installed a backdoor on a victim's computer.
- The backdoor has the capability to shut down the victim's computer, which is an action that disrupts operations and impacts system availability.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the Command and Control (C&C) channel using encrypted communication.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.

Given the context of the question, the attackers have already demonstrated the ability to disrupt operations by shutting down the victim's computer. This indicates that they have a level of control over the system. It is common for attackers to exfiltrate data once they have control, and using encrypted communication is a standard practice to avoid detection and to ensure the data remains secure during transmission.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already shown their ability to disrupt operations, which implies they have a level of control over the system.
- It is a common practice for attackers to exfiltrate data after gaining control to maintain their presence and potentially for future use.
- Encrypted communication is a standard method for exfiltrating data to avoid detection and ensure data security.

Final Answer: A: Yes
