Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a malware (Aurora) that communicates with Command and Control (C&C) servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will modify the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL and load the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the Aurora malware will perform the described actions.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the Aurora malware will perform the described actions.

To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice, we need to consider the following:
1. Aurora malware is known to be sophisticated and adaptive.
2. Modifying file-time to match an existing system DLL is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.
3. Loading the DLL into svchost.exe is another common technique to hide the presence of the malware, as svchost.exe is a legitimate system process.

Given these points, it is plausible that Aurora malware would use these techniques to evade detection.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: Aurora malware is designed to be sophisticated and adaptive, which means it is likely to employ various techniques to avoid detection.
- Step 2: Modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL is a well-known technique used by malware to blend in with legitimate files.
- Step 3: Loading the DLL into svchost.exe is a method to leverage a legitimate system process to hide the presence of the malware.

Final Answer: A: Yes
