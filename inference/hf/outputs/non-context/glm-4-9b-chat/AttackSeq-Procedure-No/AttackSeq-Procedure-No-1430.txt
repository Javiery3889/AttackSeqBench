Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a cyber attack. The sequence is as follows:
  1. Collecting the OS version from the SystemVersion.plist file during discovery.
  2. Accessing and downloading information stored in SharePoint instances.
  3. Performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 (Command and Control) servers.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after collecting the OS version, Smooth Operator is likely to access and download information from SharePoint instances before communicating with its C2 servers via HTTPS.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that after collecting the OS version, Smooth Operator is not likely to access and download information from SharePoint instances before communicating with its C2 servers via HTTPS.

Smooth Operator is a known malware that has been associated with various cyber espionage campaigns. It is known to perform reconnaissance, gather information, and establish communication with its C2 servers. The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the typical behavior of Smooth Operator.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: Smooth Operator is designed to perform reconnaissance, which includes collecting information about the target environment.
- Step 2: Accessing and downloading information from SharePoint instances is a common method for malware to gather data from a network.
- Step 3: After gathering information, the malware would typically establish communication with its C2 servers to report findings or receive further instructions.
- Step 4: HTTPS-based communication is a common method for C2 communication to ensure the communication is secure and harder to intercept.

Based on the typical behavior of Smooth Operator and the sequence of TTPs described, it is plausible that the malware would access and download information from SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
