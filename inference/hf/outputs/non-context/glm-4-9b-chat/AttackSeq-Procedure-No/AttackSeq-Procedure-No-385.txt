1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15. The sequence includes deploying backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS), using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution, and then asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Deploy backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS)
     2. Use RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution
     3. Use Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials
     4. Steal a VPN certificate to access the network remotely

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz and stole a VPN certificate after deploying the backdoors and using RoyalCLI.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that APT15 used Mimikatz and stole a VPN certificate after deploying the backdoors and using RoyalCLI.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: APT15 has already deployed backdoors, which are designed to provide persistent access to a network. This is a common initial step in an attack.
   - Step 2: The use of RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution is a technique that can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with higher privileges, which is a typical step in escalating privileges.
   - Step 3: Mimikatz is a tool that is often used to extract credentials from memory, which can include domain administrator credentials. This is a plausible step after escalating privileges to gain access to sensitive information.
   - Step 4: Stealing a VPN certificate would allow the attacker to access the network remotely without the need for additional authentication, which is a common goal for attackers who have already compromised a network.

Given that the sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and follows a typical progression of an attack, it is reasonable to conclude that the use of Mimikatz and the theft of a VPN certificate are plausible steps in the attack.

Final Answer: A: Yes
