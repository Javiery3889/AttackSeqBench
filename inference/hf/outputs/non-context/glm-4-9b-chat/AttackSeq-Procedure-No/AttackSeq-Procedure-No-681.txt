1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access.
   - The sequence then asks if adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that adversaries will only detect the compromised Docker APIs after deploying malicious containers.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that adversaries will detect the compromised Docker APIs during reconnaissance, before deploying malicious containers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Reconnaissance is the initial phase of an attack where adversaries gather information about the target environment. This phase is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and entry points.
   - Step 2: If the Docker API ports are misconfigured and exposed to the internet, they are likely to be discovered during the reconnaissance phase, as tools like DOCKERGEDDON are designed to scan for such vulnerabilities.
   - Step 3: The fact that the question specifies "after deploying malicious containers" implies that the reconnaissance phase has already occurred, and the adversaries are now in the exploitation phase.
   - Step 4: Given that the reconnaissance phase is about identifying vulnerabilities, it is more plausible that adversaries would detect the compromised Docker APIs during this phase rather than after deploying malicious containers.

Final Answer: B: No
