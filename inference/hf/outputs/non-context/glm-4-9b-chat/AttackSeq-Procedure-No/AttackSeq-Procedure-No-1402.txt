Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are likely to be used by FIN13, a known cyber threat actor.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.
  2. Using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement.
  3. Collecting data from network shared drives.
  4. Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that FIN13 would use the described TTPs in the sequence provided.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that FIN13 would not use the described TTPs in the sequence provided.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first TTP mentioned is leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. This is a common initial step for an attacker to gather information about the target environment.
- The second TTP is using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. This is a plausible step as attackers often use legitimate tools to move laterally within a network without raising suspicion.
- The third TTP is collecting data from network shared drives. This is a logical step after reconnaissance and lateral movement, as the attacker would need to gather data to perform fraudulent transactions.
- The fourth TTP is targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions. This is a typical goal of cyber attacks, especially those carried out by financially motivated threat actors like FIN13.

Given that each step in the sequence is plausible and follows a logical progression, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
