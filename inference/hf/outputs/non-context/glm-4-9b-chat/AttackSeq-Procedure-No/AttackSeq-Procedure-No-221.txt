Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a Shellbot has established C&C (Command and Control) communication using an IRC channel.
- The question then asks whether the Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host, including details such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host after establishing C&C communication.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Shellbot is not likely to gather information about the infected host after establishing C&C communication.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: After establishing C&C communication, a malware or bot typically has the ability to receive commands from its C&C server.
- Step 2: Gathering information about the infected host is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by malware to understand the environment it is operating in and to determine the best way to exploit it.
- Step 3: The information requested (processor cores, type of processor, presence of monitoring tools) is useful for the malware to optimize its operations and avoid detection.
- Step 4: Given that the Shellbot has already established C&C communication, it is plausible that it would proceed with gathering information about the host to better understand its environment.

Final Answer: A: Yes
