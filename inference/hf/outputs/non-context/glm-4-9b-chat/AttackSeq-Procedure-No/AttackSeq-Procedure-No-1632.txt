1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where an adversary has compressed and encrypted large chunks of data and is preparing to exfiltrate them.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (which is 1,048,576 bytes, or 1 MB) or more before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that if the file size is 1 MB or more, the adversary will divide the files before exfiltration.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the adversary will not divide the files if the size is 1 MB or more before exfiltration.

   To evaluate these choices, we need to consider the following:
   - Large files can be challenging to exfiltrate due to bandwidth limitations and the potential for detection by security systems.
   - Dividing files into smaller chunks can help bypass size-based detection mechanisms and allow for more efficient exfiltration over networks with limited bandwidth.
   - Adversaries often use techniques to evade detection, and dividing large files is a common method to do so.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Recognize that large files can be difficult to exfiltrate without being detected.
   - Step 2: Consider that dividing files into smaller chunks is a common technique used by adversaries to facilitate exfiltration.
   - Step 3: Acknowledge that the size threshold of 1 MB is significant, as it is a common size at which files might be divided for exfiltration purposes.
   - Step 4: Conclude that it is likely that the adversary would divide files if they are 1 MB or more in size to facilitate exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
