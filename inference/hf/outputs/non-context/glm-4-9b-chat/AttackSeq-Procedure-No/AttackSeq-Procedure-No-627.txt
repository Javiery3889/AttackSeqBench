1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the TTPs of the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor. It mentions that the backdoor communicated with Command and Control (C2) servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase of the attack.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework typically involves an attacker gathering information about the target environment to understand the attack surface and identify potential targets. This phase often includes actions such as process discovery, system information discovery, and lateral movement.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question (protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP) are indicative of the initial stages of the attack, which are more aligned with the Execution phase rather than the Discovery phase. The Execution phase involves actions that lead to the establishment of a presence on the target system, such as deploying a backdoor.
   - Given that the backdoor has already established a C2 channel, it is less likely that it is still in the Discovery phase, as it would have already gathered the necessary information to communicate with the C2 server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The TTPs described are associated with the Execution phase, not the Discovery phase.
   - Step 2: Since the backdoor has already established a C2 channel, it is reasonable to assume that it has completed the Discovery phase.
   - Step 3: Therefore, it is not likely that the SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: B: No
