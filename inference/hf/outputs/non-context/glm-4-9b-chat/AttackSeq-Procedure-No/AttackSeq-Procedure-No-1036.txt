Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group, specifically APT10, is likely to use.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Use Mimikatz to enable credential theft.
  2. Access Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller.
  3. Deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT database file.
  4. Determine the likelihood of APT10 leveraging remote COM execution to deliver Beacon payloads for lateral movement.
  5. Compare this with the alternative of logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibiting logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that APT10 will use remote COM execution to deliver Beacon payloads for lateral movement.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that APT10 will not use remote COM execution and instead will log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibit logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours.

To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice:
- APT10 is known for its sophisticated tactics, which often include the use of remote COM execution for lateral movement. This technique allows attackers to execute code on remote systems without requiring credentials, which is consistent with the initial use of Mimikatz for credential theft.
- The alternative of logging in via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibiting logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours could be a plausible approach, but it requires more manual effort and may be less stealthy than remote COM execution.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: APT10 has already compromised credentials and domain controllers, indicating a high level of sophistication.
- Step 2: Remote COM execution is a common and stealthy method for lateral movement that aligns with the group's known tactics.
- Step 3: The alternative method requires additional steps and may be less stealthy, which is less likely for a sophisticated group like APT10.

Final Answer: A: Yes
