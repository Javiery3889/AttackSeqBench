Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where Poison Ivy server is delivered as mobile code via social engineering methods.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications with the attacker's client during the C2 phase.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Poison Ivy (also known as PoisonIvy or Carberp) is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) that has historically been used for various malicious activities, including data theft, keylogging, and lateral movement within a network.
- Google Drive is a cloud storage service that can be used for file storage and sharing. It can also be used for C2 communications due to its wide availability and the ability to upload and download files.
- The use of Google Drive for C2 communications is a plausible TTP because it allows attackers to avoid detection by traditional network defenses, as it uses legitimate services that are often whitelisted or not monitored closely.

Answer Choice A: Yes
- This answer suggests that it is likely that the malware will use Google Drive for C2 communications.

Answer Choice B: No
- This answer suggests that it is not likely that the malware will use Google Drive for C2 communications.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Given that Poison Ivy is a RAT and that Google Drive can be used for C2 communications, it is plausible that an attacker might choose to use Google Drive for its stealth capabilities.
- The use of Google Drive for C2 communications is a common TTP, especially in cases where the attacker wants to avoid detection by using legitimate services.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware could use Google Drive for C2 communications.

Final Answer: A: Yes
