1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of AtomBombing to leverage Windows operating system mechanisms for malicious code injection and execution via legitimate programs.
   - The follow-up question asks whether it is likely that the threat actors will use a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) script, such as embedding it within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that the threat actors would use a VBA script as part of their strategy after using AtomBombing.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that the threat actors would use a VBA script as part of their strategy after using AtomBombing.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: AtomBombing is a technique that allows attackers to inject malicious code into legitimate programs by leveraging the way Windows handles .NET assemblies.
   - Step 2: The goal of AtomBombing is to execute this malicious code without raising any security alarms, often by using legitimate programs that are already present on the target system.
   - Step 3: VBA scripts are commonly used in Microsoft Office documents, such as Word and Excel, to automate tasks or to include additional functionality.
   - Step 4: Embedding a VBA script within a malicious Word document is a common method for delivering malware because it can bypass certain security measures and is often overlooked by users.
   - Step 5: Given that the initial TTP involves leveraging legitimate programs for code injection, it is plausible that the attackers would continue to use legitimate programs to deliver their payload, such as a VBA script embedded in a Word document.

Final Answer: A: Yes
