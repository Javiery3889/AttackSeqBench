Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence that starts with sending a PDF attachment.
- The PDF attachment passes through security filters and appears benign.
- The attacker then abuses the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and elevate privileges.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the described attack sequence is plausible.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the described attack sequence is not plausible.

The sequence described in the question is a common attack pattern. Attackers often use benign-looking files to bypass security filters, and once inside the network, they look for ways to elevate their privileges. The Windows AutoElevate backdoor is a well-known method to bypass UAC, which is a security feature designed to prevent unauthorized elevation of privileges.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first step of the attack is to deliver a malicious PDF attachment, which is a common initial vector for phishing attacks.
- The second step is for the PDF to pass through security filters, which are designed to detect and block malicious content. The fact that it appears benign suggests that the filters were not effective or the PDF was crafted to evade detection.
- The third step is the exploitation of the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass UAC. This is a well-documented technique that allows attackers to elevate their privileges on a system.

Given the plausibility of each step in the sequence, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
