1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that the GreyEnergy group is likely to use in an attack. The sequence includes:
     a. Compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini.
     b. Using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the initial compromise and credential collection, the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the GreyEnergy group will not use PDQ Deploy for this purpose.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: GreyEnergy is known for its use of GreyEnergy mini, a malware used for initial access and lateral movement within a network.
   - Step 2: Nmap is a network mapping tool, and Mimikatz is used for credential harvesting. These are common tools used by attackers to gather information and move laterally within a network.
   - Step 3: The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network. PDQ Deploy is a software deployment tool used by IT administrators to deploy software across a network. It is not typically associated with malicious activities or used by cybercriminals for spreading malware.
   - Step 4: Given that GreyEnergy is a cyber espionage group and not a ransomware group, it is less likely that they would use a legitimate software deployment tool like PDQ Deploy to spread malware. They are more likely to use more stealthy and less detectable methods for lateral movement and malware deployment.

Final Answer: B: No
