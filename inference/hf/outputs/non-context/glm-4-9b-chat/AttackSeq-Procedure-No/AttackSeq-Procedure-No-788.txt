1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will compromise legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     a. Distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
     b. Compromising legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that it is likely the Higaisa APT group would use the described TTPs.
     - The Higaisa APT group is known for its sophisticated tactics, which may include compromising legitimate software updates to deliver malware.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that it is not likely the Higaisa APT group would use the described TTPs.
     - While it is less common for APT groups to compromise web browser updates, it is not entirely unprecedented, especially for groups with advanced capabilities like Higaisa.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Higaisa APT group is known for its advanced and sophisticated tactics.
   - Step 2: Spear-phishing is a common initial attack vector for APT groups, and distributing malicious LNK files is a known method used by the Higaisa group.
   - Step 3: Compromising legitimate software updates is a tactic that has been used by other sophisticated APT groups, although it is less common.
   - Step 4: Given the group's capabilities and the tactics they have employed in the past, it is plausible that they could use the described sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
