Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode is used for command and control (C2) communication.
- The next step in the sequence is whether the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after establishing C2 communication, the OceanLotus backdoor will proceed to survey the victim's computer.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor will not survey the victim's computer after establishing C2 communication.

The OceanLotus backdoor is known to be a sophisticated piece of malware that is used by the OceanLotus threat actor group. This group is known for its targeted attacks on various industries, including government entities and businesses. Given the nature of such attacks, it is common for malware to perform reconnaissance on the victim's system to gather information that can be used for further exploitation or to maintain persistence.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: Establishing C2 communication is a critical step for malware to receive commands and send data back to its operators.
- Step 2: After establishing C2 communication, the next logical step for the malware would be to gather information about the victim's system to understand the environment and potentially to exfiltrate sensitive data.
- Step 3: Given the nature of the OceanLotus backdoor and the typical behavior of such malware, it is highly plausible that it would survey the victim's computer to gather details.

Final Answer: A: Yes
