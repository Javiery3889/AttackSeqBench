1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where SLUB malware is interacting with a Mattermost server during the Discovery phase. It mentions that the malware collects system information and captures screenshots.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 (Command and Control) server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase is typically the initial phase of an attack where the attacker gathers information about the target environment. During this phase, the malware is likely to be collecting data to understand the target's infrastructure and potential vulnerabilities.
   - The Exfiltration phase is where the attacker extracts the data they have collected from the target environment and sends it back to the attacker's command and control server.
   - While it is common for malware to exfiltrate data during the Exfiltration phase, the question specifies that the malware is "likely" to do so. This implies that there might be a possibility that the exfiltration does not occur automatically.
   - The answer choices provided are:
     A: Yes, the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server.
     B: No, the malware will not automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Discovery phase is about gathering information, not necessarily about exfiltration.
   - Step 2: The Exfiltration phase is where data is typically sent back to the attacker.
   - Step 3: The question asks if the exfiltration is "likely" to occur automatically, which suggests that it might not always happen automatically.
   - Step 4: Given that the exfiltration is part of the Exfiltration phase, it is a plausible action for the malware to take, but the use of "likely" indicates that it is not a guaranteed action.

Final Answer: B: No
