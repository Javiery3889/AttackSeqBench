1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where Regin, a sophisticated malware, is being used.
   - The scenario involves monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes.
   - The question asks whether Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase of an attack.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Regin is a highly advanced malware that has been associated with targeted espionage operations.
   - During the discovery phase of an attack, malware typically looks for information about the target environment to understand the network, systems, and potential points of interest.
   - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) during the discovery phase as it helps the malware to understand the current state of the system and identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - Scanning for deleted files is also a plausible TTP during the discovery phase, as it can help the malware find remnants of other malware or deleted data that might be useful for the attacker.

Given the nature of Regin and the typical TTPs associated with the discovery phase, both of the mentioned TTPs (gathering information on processes and memory utilization, and scanning for deleted files) are plausible.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify that Regin is a sophisticated malware used in targeted attacks.
   - Step 2: Recognize that the discovery phase involves gathering information about the target environment.
   - Step 3: Acknowledge that gathering information on processes and memory utilization is a common TTP during the discovery phase.
   - Step 4: Acknowledge that scanning for deleted files is also a common TTP during the discovery phase.
   - Step 5: Conclude that both TTPs are plausible for Regin during the discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
