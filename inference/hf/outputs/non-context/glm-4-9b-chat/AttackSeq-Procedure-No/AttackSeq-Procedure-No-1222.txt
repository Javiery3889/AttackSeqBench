Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the T9000 malware. The sequence includes evading detection, ensuring only one instance runs, retrieving encrypted commands, and performing follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining and data capture.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Evade detection by customizing installation
  2. Ensure only one instance runs via mutexes and named events
  3. Retrieve encrypted commands from a command and control (C2) server
  4. Perform follow-on actions (cryptocurrency mining and data capture)

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the initial steps, the malware is likely to retrieve encrypted commands and then perform follow-on actions.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that after the initial steps, the malware is not likely to retrieve encrypted commands and perform follow-on actions.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The typical behavior of malware, especially those designed for cryptocurrency mining or data theft, is to first establish persistence on the system and then communicate with a C2 server to receive instructions on what actions to take.
- The question describes the malware evading detection and ensuring it runs only once, which are common steps for malware to establish a presence on a system without being detected or competing with other instances.
- The next logical step in the sequence would be to retrieve commands from the C2 server, which would then dictate actions such as cryptocurrency mining or data theft.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would retrieve encrypted commands before performing the follow-on actions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
