1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where encoded PowerShell commands are used to download and execute payloads from URLs.
   - It then asks whether the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection only after establishing a connection with the C2 server at 61.97.243.15.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The FHAPPI campaign is known for its use of PowerShell and fileless techniques to evade detection.
   - Fileless techniques refer to methods that do not involve the creation of files on disk, which can be harder for traditional antivirus software to detect.
   - The question specifies that the campaign would use fileless techniques "only after establishing a connection with the C2 server."

   Answer Choice A: Yes
   - This answer suggests that the FHAPPI campaign would use fileless techniques after connecting to the C2 server.

   Answer Choice B: No
   - This answer suggests that the FHAPPI campaign would not use fileless techniques after connecting to the C2 server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The FHAPPI campaign is known for its use of PowerShell and fileless techniques, which are designed to avoid detection.
   - The campaign's use of fileless techniques is a key aspect of its methodology, as it allows the attackers to operate without leaving a footprint on the disk.
   - The question specifies that the fileless techniques are used "only after establishing a connection with the C2 server," which implies that the initial stages of the attack may involve more traditional methods that leave traces on the disk.
   - Given this context, it is plausible that the campaign would use fileless techniques to avoid detection after establishing a connection with the C2 server, as this would allow the attackers to maintain persistence and command and control without detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
