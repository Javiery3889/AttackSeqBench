1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving RIG EK's exploit server returning encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm. The question then asks if it is likely that proxy servers will be used within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that proxy servers are likely to be used in the infrastructure to obfuscate the source of the infection and make it harder to detect.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that proxy servers are not likely to be used in the infrastructure.

Given the context of the question, the use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel indicates a sophisticated approach to evading detection. Proxy servers are a common technique used by cyber attackers to further obfuscate their activities and make it harder for security systems to trace the source of an attack.

3. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The use of a custom RC4 algorithm for encryption suggests an attempt to hide the exploit code from detection.
   - Step 2: Encryption alone is not enough to ensure that the attack is undetectable, as other parts of the attack infrastructure can still be traced.
   - Step 3: Proxy servers are a well-known method to route traffic through multiple servers, making it difficult to trace the original source of the attack.
   - Step 4: Given the sophistication of the encryption and the need for additional obfuscation, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would use proxy servers to further complicate detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
