1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of a command to gather system information, sending that information to a specific IP address, and then establishing an HTTPS communication with a domain for further operations.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Use the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to discover system information.
     2. Send the system information to '45.124.132.127'.
     3. Establish an HTTPS communication with the domain 'marina-info.net' for further operations.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the malware will establish HTTPS communication with the command and control server only after contacting the domain 'marina-info.net'.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the malware will not establish HTTPS communication with the command and control server only after contacting the domain 'marina-info.net'.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs provided in the question does not explicitly state that the malware must contact 'marina-info.net' before establishing HTTPS communication with the command and control server. It only mentions that the system information is sent to '45.124.132.127' and then there is an HTTPS communication with a domain.
   - The domain 'marina-info.net' is not mentioned as the destination for the HTTPS communication, but rather as a domain that could be involved in further operations.
   - Without additional context or information that specifies the sequence of operations, it is not possible to conclude that the malware will only establish HTTPS communication after contacting 'marina-info.net'.

Final Answer: B: No
