Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack. The sequence includes:
  1. Leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access.
  2. Executing shellcode to make memory executable.
  3. Bypassing EAF (Exploitation for Analysis Framework) mitigation.
  4. Bypassing ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) protections.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the zero-day exploit will not bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.

The typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack that involves memory execution and defense evasion would be to first bypass the protections that are designed to prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities. EAF mitigation is a type of protection that can prevent the exploitation of certain vulnerabilities, such as those that rely on memory corruption. ASLR and DEP are designed to prevent the execution of code in non-executable memory regions and to randomize the memory addresses used by a program, respectively.

Given that the attack sequence in the question involves memory access and execution, it is likely that the attacker would attempt to bypass the protections that directly relate to these actions first. EAF mitigation is specifically related to the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, which is what the initial steps of the attack are focused on. Therefore, it is plausible that the attacker would bypass EAF mitigation before moving on to bypass ASLR and DEP.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial steps of the attack involve memory access and execution, which are directly related to the protections that EAF mitigation is designed to prevent.
- It is logical for an attacker to bypass the protection that is most directly related to the current phase of the attack before moving on to other protections.
- Therefore, it is likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.

Final Answer: A: Yes
