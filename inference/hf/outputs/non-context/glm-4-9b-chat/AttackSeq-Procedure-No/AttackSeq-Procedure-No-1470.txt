Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that likely occur in a cyber attack. The sequence mentioned is:
  1. Reconnaissance activities (gathering publicly available information on systems and conducting active discovery methods)
  2. Installation of malicious implants (like BlackEnergy 3) on the network
  3. Execution of payloads using Ruby scripts after the implants are installed

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after reconnaissance, the attackers would use Ruby scripts to execute payloads with the help of the installed malicious implants.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that after reconnaissance, the attackers would not use Ruby scripts to execute payloads with the help of the installed malicious implants.

To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice, we need to consider the typical behavior of malware like BlackEnergy 3 and the use of Ruby scripts in such attacks.

- BlackEnergy 3 is a known malware that has been used in targeted attacks, often targeting industrial control systems (ICS). It is known to use various methods to propagate and execute payloads.
- Ruby scripts are not typically associated with BlackEnergy 3. BlackEnergy 3 is generally written in C++ and uses other methods for payload execution, such as PowerShell scripts or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) commands.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: Reconnaissance activities are a common initial step in cyber attacks, and gathering information about systems and conducting active discovery is a plausible first action.
- Step 2: The installation of a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3 is also a plausible step following reconnaissance, as it is a known method of delivering malware to a target network.
- Step 3: The use of Ruby scripts to execute payloads is not a typical behavior for BlackEnergy 3. The malware is more likely to use other methods that are more aligned with its C++ nature and the typical attack vectors it employs.

Final Answer: B: No
