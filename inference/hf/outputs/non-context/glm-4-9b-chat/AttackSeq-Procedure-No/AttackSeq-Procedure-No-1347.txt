Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has evaded detection during the installation of a payload app called "callCam."
- The question then asks if it is likely that the app will use RSA and AES encryption algorithms for data exfiltration to a Command and Control (C&C) server before collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely the app will use RSA and AES encryption for exfiltration.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely the app will use RSA and AES encryption for exfiltration.

To evaluate the answer choices, we need to consider the following:
1. RSA and AES are both strong encryption algorithms commonly used for secure data transmission.
2. Cyber attackers often use encryption to hide their activities and evade detection.
3. The question specifies that the app has already evaded detection, which implies that the attacker is likely to continue using methods that maintain stealth.
4. Exfiltrating data without encryption would be easier to detect, as the data would be in plain text.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Given that the attacker has already evaded detection, it is reasonable to assume that they would continue to use methods that maintain stealth.
- RSA and AES are strong encryption algorithms that are commonly used for exfiltration to ensure that the data is not easily intercepted or read by unauthorized parties.
- The fact that the app is collecting files and screenshots suggests that it is designed to steal sensitive information, which would be more secure if encrypted before transmission.

Final Answer: A: Yes
