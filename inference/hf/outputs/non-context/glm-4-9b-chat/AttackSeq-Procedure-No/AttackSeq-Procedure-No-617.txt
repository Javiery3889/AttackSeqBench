1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where Hidden Cobra has developed Bankshot implants, which are capable of full system control and file wiping. The tactic mentioned is Resource Development.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely Hidden Cobra would use the described TTPs (Tactic: Resource Development, Technique: Spear Phishing, Tool: Malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878) to target Turkish financial organizations.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely Hidden Cobra would use the described TTPs to target Turkish financial organizations.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Hidden Cobra is known for its targeted attacks on various industries, including financial organizations.
   - Step 2: The use of Bankshot implants indicates a sophisticated and targeted approach, which is consistent with the behavior of Hidden Cobra.
   - Step 3: Spear phishing is a common initial access vector for targeted attacks, and the use of a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878 is a well-documented technique used by various threat actors, including Hidden Cobra.
   - Step 4: The tactic of Resource Development fits well with the scenario of developing and deploying Bankshot implants, which are resources for the attack.
   - Step 5: Given the above points, it is plausible that Hidden Cobra would use the described TTPs to target Turkish financial organizations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
