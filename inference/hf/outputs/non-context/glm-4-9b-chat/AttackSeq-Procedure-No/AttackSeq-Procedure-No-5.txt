1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where recipients are first presented with a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report.
   - The recipients are then likely to receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents.
   - The RTF documents are said to exploit CVE-2017-8750 for the delivery of QuasarRAT.
   - The question asks if this sequence of TTPs is likely to occur only after the recipients have already been infected with QuasarRAT.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the recipients must be infected with QuasarRAT before they receive the spear phishing emails with the RTF documents.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the recipients can receive the spear phishing emails with the RTF documents before or after being infected with QuasarRAT.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial action is the delivery of a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report. This is a common initial step in spear phishing attacks.
   - Step 2: The recipients are then sent spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents. This is also a typical TTP in spear phishing campaigns.
   - Step 3: The RTF documents exploit CVE-2017-8750, which is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be used to deliver malware, such as QuasarRAT.
   - Step 4: The question asks if the recipients must be infected with QuasarRAT before receiving the spear phishing emails. This is not a typical sequence in a spear phishing attack. The infection typically occurs after the initial phishing attempt, not before.
   - Step 5: Therefore, it is more plausible that the recipients would receive the spear phishing emails with the RTF documents before or after being infected with QuasarRAT, rather than only after being infected.

Final Answer: B: No
