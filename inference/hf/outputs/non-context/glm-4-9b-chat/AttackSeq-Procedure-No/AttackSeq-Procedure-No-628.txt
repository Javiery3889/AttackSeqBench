1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor performing process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework typically involves gathering information about the target environment to understand the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.
   - Blogs and WordPress are common platforms that can be used for C2 infrastructure due to their widespread use and the ability to host malicious content without raising immediate suspicion.
   - The use of blogs and WordPress for C2 channels is a plausible TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) as it aligns with the need for evasive and scalable C2 infrastructure.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The question specifies that the SombRAT backdoor has already completed the Discovery phase, which involves gathering information about the target environment.
   - Step 2: Given that blogs and WordPress are common platforms for C2 infrastructure, they are a plausible choice for establishing a C2 channel.
   - Step 3: The use of blogs and WordPress for C2 channels is a well-documented TTP, especially for malware that needs to remain undetected and communicate with its command and control server.
   - Step 4: Therefore, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure to establish a Command and Control channel after the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
