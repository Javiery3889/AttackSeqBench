Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the extraction of Chrome passwords, followed by potential actions of spyware.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Extract Chrome passwords
  2. Query Google Chrome's SQLite databases using libchrome.exe
  3. Collect data from USB drives
  4. Collect keystrokes
  5. Collect screen images
  6. Exfiltrate data

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the spyware will automatically perform all the actions listed after extracting Chrome passwords.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the spyware will not automatically perform the actions listed after extracting Chrome passwords.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question implies a sequence of actions that the spyware might take after extracting Chrome passwords. However, the question does not provide information on whether the spyware is designed to perform these additional actions automatically or if it requires manual intervention.
- The sequence of actions listed (collecting data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images) are common activities for spyware, but the question's focus is on the sequence of actions following the extraction of Chrome passwords.
- Since the question does not specify that the spyware is designed to perform these actions automatically, it is not a given that the spyware will do so without further instructions or triggers.

Final Answer: B: No
