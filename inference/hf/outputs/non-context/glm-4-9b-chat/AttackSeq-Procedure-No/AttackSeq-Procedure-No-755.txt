Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Rising Sun implant has communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests for command and control (C2) purposes.
- The question then asks if it is likely that the implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests.
  2. The implant performs initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that it is likely the implant performed reconnaissance after establishing C2 communication.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that it is not likely the implant performed reconnaissance after establishing C2 communication.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The typical sequence of an implant's behavior after establishing C2 communication is to first establish a connection with the attacker's server, then proceed with reconnaissance to gather information about the compromised system and network.
- The question implies that the implant has already established C2 communication, which is a step that comes after reconnaissance.
- Therefore, it is not likely that the implant would perform reconnaissance immediately after establishing C2 communication, as it would have already gathered the necessary information to communicate with the server.

Final Answer: B: No
