1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where a threat actor has performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information using the Rising Sun implant.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actor communicated with a Command and Control (C2) server using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Rising Sun implant is a type of malware that is designed to perform reconnaissance and exfiltrate data. It is not uncommon for such malware to communicate with a C2 server to receive commands and send exfiltrated data.
   - Blogs and WordPress are common platforms that can be used for C2 communication due to their widespread use and the ability to host malicious content. However, they are not typically the first choice for C2 communication due to the potential for detection and the need for more sophisticated methods to avoid detection.
   - The question implies that the implant has already performed reconnaissance, which suggests that it has a level of sophistication that may allow it to use more complex methods of communication.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Rising Sun implant has already performed reconnaissance, indicating a level of sophistication.
   - Step 2: Blogs and WordPress are not the most common or sophisticated methods for C2 communication.
   - Step 3: Given the sophistication of the implant, it is less likely that it would use blogs and WordPress for C2 communication, as this would be a less secure and more detectable method.

Final Answer: B: No
