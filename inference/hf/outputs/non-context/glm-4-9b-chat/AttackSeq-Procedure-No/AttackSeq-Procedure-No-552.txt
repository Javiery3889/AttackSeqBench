Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a backdoor, hooks in a DLL, stealth, blocking event logging, and the potential use of a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD to backdoor a service principal with ApplicationImpersonation rights to start collecting emails from targeted mailboxes.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that after the initial sequence of actions, the attacker will use a compromised global administrator account to further their access and capabilities.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the attacker will not use a compromised global administrator account to backdoor a service principal.

Given the context of the question, the sequence of TTPs described so far involves the attacker gaining initial access and then attempting to maintain persistence and evade detection. The use of a global administrator account in Azure AD to backdoor a service principal is a plausible next step in the attack, as it would allow the attacker to gain more extensive access and potentially move laterally within the network.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial backdoor and the use of hooks in a DLL are indicative of an attacker looking to establish a persistent presence on the system.
- The stealth and blocking of event logging are techniques used to avoid detection by security systems.
- The use of a compromised global administrator account to backdoor a service principal is a logical progression in the attack, as it would provide the attacker with the ability to access and collect sensitive information, such as emails from targeted mailboxes.
- The sequence of actions described in the question is consistent with the behavior of an attacker looking to escalate privileges and maintain a presence within the network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
