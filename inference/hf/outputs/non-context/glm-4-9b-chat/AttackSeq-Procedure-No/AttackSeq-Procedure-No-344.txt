1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the identification of an Internet Explorer zero-day exploit by FireEye Research Labs.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     - Execution of native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo)
     - Bypassing Windows' ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) protections
     - Execution of shellcode that downloads the next stage payload

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the zero-day exploit does execute the mentioned native Windows functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP, and then executing the shellcode.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the zero-day exploit does not execute the mentioned native Windows functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP, and then executing the shellcode.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial step of a typical exploit is to gather information about the target environment. This is often done by executing native Windows functions like GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo.
   - Step 2: After gathering information, the exploit would typically attempt to bypass security measures such as ASLR and DEP. This is a common step in exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.
   - Step 3: Once the security measures are bypassed, the exploit would execute shellcode, which is a small piece of code that is used to perform actions on the system, such as downloading and executing additional payloads.

Based on the typical sequence of steps in exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, it is plausible that the exploit would execute the mentioned native Windows functions before bypassing ASLR and DEP, and then executing the shellcode.

Final Answer: A: Yes
