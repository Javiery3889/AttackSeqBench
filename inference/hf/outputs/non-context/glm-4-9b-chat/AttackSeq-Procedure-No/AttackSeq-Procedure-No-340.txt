1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where the Nemesis bootkit has achieved persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR).
   - The follow-up question asks whether the malware is likely to evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Nemesis bootkit is a type of malware that is designed to infect the boot sector of a computer, which is a common technique for achieving persistence on a system.
   - Malware authors often attempt to evade detection by placing their files in locations that are less likely to be scanned by antivirus software. This is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by malware.
   - The question suggests that the malware places install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. This is a plausible TTP as it aligns with the behavior of malware trying to avoid detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The question describes a scenario where the malware has already achieved persistence, which is a common goal for malware.
   - Step 2: The question then asks if the malware is likely to evade detection by placing files in excluded directories. This is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection.
   - Step 3: Given that evading detection is a common objective for malware, and placing files in excluded directories is a known method to achieve this, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would likely use this TTP.

Final Answer: A: Yes
