Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the execution of SparrowDoor, the use of cmd.exe commands, communication with a C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel, and asks whether SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that SparrowDoor exploited an RCE vulnerability in an internet-facing application to gain Initial Access.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that SparrowDoor did not exploit an RCE vulnerability in an internet-facing application for Initial Access.

The sequence of events described in the question includes:
1. Execution of SparrowDoor
2. Use of cmd.exe commands
3. Communication with a C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel

From this sequence, we can infer that SparrowDoor was used to establish a presence on the target system. The use of cmd.exe commands and encrypted communication with a C&C server are indicative of post-compromise activities rather than Initial Access. Typically, Initial Access refers to the initial entry into a network or system, which is often achieved through exploiting a vulnerability in an internet-facing application.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first step in the sequence is the execution of SparrowDoor, which is a post-compromise activity rather than an Initial Access technique.
- The second step involves the use of cmd.exe commands, which is also a post-compromise activity.
- The third step is the communication with a C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel, which is a post-compromise activity as well.
- None of these steps involve exploiting an RCE vulnerability in an internet-facing application for Initial Access.

Final Answer: B: No
