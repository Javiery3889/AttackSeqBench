Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence involving the delivery of a malicious payload using KerrDown via Microsoft Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading.
- The sequence also mentions the use of base64 encoded blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture.
- Finally, the question asks if the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before the payload execution.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before executing the payload.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Office document will not contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before executing the payload.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The typical attack sequence for delivering a payload via a malicious Office document often involves tricking the user into enabling macros, which then allow for the execution of the payload.
- The use of base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture is a method that can be used to bypass security measures and ensure compatibility with different system architectures.
- The inclusion of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros is a social engineering technique that is often used in such attacks to manipulate the user into taking the desired action.
- Given the typical attack patterns, it is plausible that the Office document would use an image file to instruct the victim to enable macros before executing the payload.

Final Answer: A: Yes
