Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where malicious JavaScript code is inserted into a Korean-language news portal.
- The purpose of the malicious code is to redirect victims to an exploit landing page that exploits CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
- The question asks whether it is likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute an embedded shellcode payload before the JavaScript code was inserted.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Heap spraying is a technique used to fill a process's heap with a large number of copies of a malicious payload, increasing the chances that one of them will be placed at a predictable memory address.
- An arbitrary read/write primitive is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read or write data at any memory address, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.
- The question suggests that the attackers might have used heap spraying to gain such a primitive and then execute a shellcode payload.
- CVE-2019-13720 is a vulnerability in Google Chrome that could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

Given the context of the question, the use of heap spraying would be a plausible step if the goal was to exploit CVE-2019-13720. Heap spraying could be used to ensure that the exploit payload is present in memory at a predictable location, which could then be used to exploit the vulnerability.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where an exploit is being used to redirect victims to a malicious landing page.
- Heap spraying is a technique that could be used to ensure the exploit payload is present in memory at a predictable location.
- Since the exploit is being used to execute code, it is plausible that the attackers would want to ensure the payload is ready to be executed.
- Therefore, it is likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute an embedded shellcode payload before inserting the malicious JavaScript code.

Final Answer: A: Yes
