Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious Microsoft Word document is delivered inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access.
- The sequence then mentions the use of a COM object to execute queries to gather system information.
- Finally, it states that a PowerShell script will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the use of a COM object to gather system information is a plausible step in the attack sequence after initial access.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the use of a COM object to gather system information is not a plausible step in the attack sequence after initial access.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is achieved by delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This is a common initial access vector for malware, as it can exploit vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Office suite.
- The next step in the sequence is the use of a COM object to execute queries to gather system information. COM objects are a common technique used by attackers to interact with the Windows operating system and can be used to retrieve sensitive information about the system.
- The final step is the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate tasks and download files, making it a common choice for attackers to deliver and execute malware.

Given that COM objects are a plausible method for attackers to gather system information and PowerShell is a common tool for executing scripts and downloading files, the sequence described in the question is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
