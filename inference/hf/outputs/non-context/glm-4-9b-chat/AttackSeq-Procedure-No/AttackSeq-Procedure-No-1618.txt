Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that have already occurred: gathering information on processes and memory utilization, and scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase.
- The question then asks if Regin, a sophisticated malware, is likely to set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is part of the initial stages of an attack, which are typically focused on reconnaissance and establishing a presence on the target system.
- Regin is a known advanced persistent threat (APT) that has been associated with targeted espionage campaigns. It is known for its stealthy and persistent nature.
- Setting auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts is a TTP that would allow the attacker to monitor network traffic by intercepting and forwarding emails to a controlled destination. This is a more advanced step in the attack lifecycle, typically associated with the exploitation or post-exploitation phases.
- Given that the question specifies that the action is likely to occur after the discovery phase, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker is still in the early stages of the attack.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The discovery phase is focused on gathering information and establishing a presence, not on the advanced actions like setting up auto-forward rules.
- Setting auto-forward rules is a more complex and targeted action that would likely occur after the attacker has already established a foothold and is looking to expand their access and control over the network.
- Therefore, it is not likely that Regin would set auto-forward rules during the discovery phase.

Final Answer: B: No
