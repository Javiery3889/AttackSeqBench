Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
  2. Collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that FamousSparrow will perform credential dumping first, followed by system information collection and file probing.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that FamousSparrow will not perform system information collection and file probing after credential dumping.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the Discovery phase is typically the initial phase of an attack where the attacker gathers information about the target environment to understand the attack surface and identify potential targets.
- Credential Access is a technique that is often used to gain initial access to a system. After gaining access, it is common for an attacker to proceed with Discovery to understand the environment better.
- It is plausible that an attacker would first dump credentials to understand the compromised systems' access rights and then proceed with Discovery to identify other systems or sensitive information.
- Therefore, it is likely that FamousSparrow would collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase after dumping credentials.

Final Answer: A: Yes
