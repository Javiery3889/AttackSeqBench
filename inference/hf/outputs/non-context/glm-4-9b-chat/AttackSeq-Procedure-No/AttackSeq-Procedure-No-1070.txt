Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. The question then asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to facilitate their attack.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Use Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
  2. Drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity.
  3. Inject a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

- Answer Choice A: Yes
  - This answer suggests that Tropic Trooper is likely to follow the described sequence of TTPs.

- Answer Choice B: No
  - This answer suggests that Tropic Trooper is not likely to follow the described sequence of TTPs.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package is a common initial step in many malware delivery methods, as Equation Editor is known to be a vector for certain types of exploits.
- The next step in the sequence is to drop a file, RegAsm.exe, which is a legitimate Windows utility. Malware actors often use legitimate files to avoid detection, and RegAsm.exe can be used to execute code.
- The final step is to inject a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe, which is a Windows process that hosts DLLs. This is a common technique for malware to persist and execute its payload.

Based on the typical behavior of malware actors and the nature of the TTPs described, it is plausible that Tropic Trooper would follow this sequence of actions to establish a presence on a system and facilitate their attack.

Final Answer: A: Yes
