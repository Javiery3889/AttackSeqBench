Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack. The sequence includes:
  1. A phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document.
  2. The document contains a VBA macro that auto-opens.
  3. The VBA macro executes commands using 'mshta.exe'.
  4. 'mshta.exe' is used to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
  5. The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' every two hours.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is plausible.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not plausible.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a common pattern in cyber attacks. Phishing emails are often used to deliver malicious payloads, and VBA macros are frequently used to bypass security measures. The use of 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper is also a known technique. Establishing persistence by creating a scheduled task is a common method for malware to ensure it remains active on the compromised system.
- Given that each step in the sequence is a plausible TTP, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
