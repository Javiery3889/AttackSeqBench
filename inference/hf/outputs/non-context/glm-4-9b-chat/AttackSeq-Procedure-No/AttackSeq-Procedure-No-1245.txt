1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where the Orion source code has been modified to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.
   - The TTP in question is whether SUNSPOT, which is a component of the SUNBURST backdoor, will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes TTPs into tactics, which include Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Lateral Movement, Persistence, Evolution, and Command and Control (C2).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTP mentioned in the question is related to the Discovery tactic, which is part of the Reconnaissance phase. Discovery involves identifying and collecting information about the target environment.
   - SUNSPOT is a component of the SUNBURST backdoor, which is a sophisticated malware used in targeted attacks. It is known to perform various malicious activities, including information gathering.
   - Monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe could be a part of the Discovery tactic, as it would allow the attacker to identify potential targets or gather information about the system's environment.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify that the question is asking about a TTP related to the Discovery tactic.
   - Step 2: Recognize that SUNSPOT, as a component of SUNBURST, is designed to perform malicious activities, including information gathering.
   - Step 3: Consider that monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe is a plausible action for a Discovery tactic, as it could provide valuable information about the target system.
   - Step 4: Conclude that the answer choice that aligns with the plausible sequence of TTPs is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
