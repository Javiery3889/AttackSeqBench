1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where a PIVY variant communicates with Command & Control (C2) servers using application layer protocols.
   - It then asks if the malware is likely to evade defenses by using DLL sideloading to load a dropped DLL and modify its configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. PIVY variant communicates with C2 servers.
     2. Uses application layer protocols.
     3. Evades defenses by using DLL sideloading.
     4. Modifies configuration to confuse parsing tools.
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the malware is likely to use DLL sideloading and modify configurations to evade defenses.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the malware is not likely to use DLL sideloading and modify configurations to evade defenses.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: PIVY variants are known to communicate with C2 servers, which is a common TTP.
   - Step 2: Using application layer protocols for communication is also a plausible TTP for malware.
   - Step 3: DLL sideloading is a technique that can be used by malware to load malicious code without detection, which is a plausible TTP for evading defenses.
   - Step 4: Modifying configurations to confuse parsing tools is another technique that can be used to evade detection, as it can make it difficult for security tools to correctly identify the malicious behavior.

Given that all the steps in the question's attack sequence are plausible TTPs, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware is likely to use these techniques to evade defenses.

Final Answer: A: Yes
