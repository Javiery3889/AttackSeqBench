Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that CosmicDuke is likely to use in an attack. The sequence includes exfiltrating data via FTP, followed by the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. It also mentions that the attacker searches removable drives and skips certain file types during collection.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that CosmicDuke would use the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltrating data via FTP and after searching removable drives while skipping certain file types.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that CosmicDuke would not use the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltrating data via FTP and after searching removable drives while skipping certain file types.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- CosmicDuke is known for its modular approach, where it uses various tools and techniques to gather information. The sequence described in the question suggests a logical progression of actions:
  1. The attacker exfiltrates data via FTP, which is a common method for data exfiltration.
  2. After exfiltration, the attacker would likely want to ensure that all relevant information is collected to maximize the value of the data.
  3. Searching removable drives can be a way to find additional data that may not be on the primary system.
  4. Skipping certain file types could be a way to focus on more valuable data or to avoid detection by filtering out common benign files.
  5. Using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer would be subsequent steps to gather more information that might not have been captured during the initial data collection phase.

Based on the logical progression of these steps, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use these tools after exfiltrating data and searching removable drives.

Final Answer: A: Yes
