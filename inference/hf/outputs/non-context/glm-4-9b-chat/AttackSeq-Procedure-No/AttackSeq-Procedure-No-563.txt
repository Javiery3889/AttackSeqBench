Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a threat actor might use in an attack.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. T1553 Subvert Trust Controls
  2. T1071 Application Layer Protocol
  3. T1057 Process Discovery

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- T1553 Subvert Trust Controls: This TTP involves bypassing or manipulating security controls to gain unauthorized access to systems.
- T1071 Application Layer Protocol: This TTP is about using application layer protocols to communicate with the target system, which can be used for command and control (C2) activities.
- T1057 Process Discovery: This TTP is about gathering information about the processes running on a system, which can be used to understand the internal network and systems of the compromised organization.

The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery after leveraging T1071 Application Layer Protocol for command and control. 

To evaluate the answer choices:
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the actors used T1057 Process Discovery after T1071 Application Layer Protocol.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the actors did not use T1057 Process Discovery after T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs in the question implies a logical progression of actions. First, the actors subvert trust controls (T1553), which would allow them to move laterally within the network. 
- After gaining access, they would likely establish command and control (C2) using T1071 Application Layer Protocol to maintain persistence and communicate with their infrastructure.
- Once they have established C2, it is plausible that they would use T1057 Process Discovery to gather information about the systems and internal networks, as this would help them understand the environment and plan further attacks.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T1057 Process Discovery is used after T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: A: Yes
