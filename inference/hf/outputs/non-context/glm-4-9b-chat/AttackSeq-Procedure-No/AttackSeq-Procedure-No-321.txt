1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where an app uploads files via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.
   - It then asks whether the app is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) only after performing routines on the iOS device.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the app will send the information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the app will not send the information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device.

   Given the context of the question, we can infer the following:
   - The app is already using FTP for file uploads, which is a common protocol for C2 operations.
   - The question implies that the app is performing some routines on the iOS device, which could include processing, filtering, or encrypting the data before sending it out.

   In the context of cybersecurity and C2 operations, it is not uncommon for an attacker to use multiple protocols for different stages of the attack. However, the question specifically asks about the likelihood of using HTTP after the FTP upload.

   - If the app is performing routines on the iOS device, it is plausible that it would need to send the processed data out. HTTP is a common protocol for sending data over the internet, and it is often used for C2 communications.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the app might send the information via HTTP after performing the necessary routines on the device.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The app is using FTP for file uploads, which is a standard C2 protocol.
   - Step 2: The app is performing routines on the iOS device, which suggests that it needs to process the data.
   - Step 3: After processing, the app would need to send the data out, and HTTP is a common protocol for such communications.
   - Step 4: Given the context, it is plausible that the app would use HTTP to send the processed data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
