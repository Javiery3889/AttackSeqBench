Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that likely occur in a cyber attack. The sequence mentioned is:
  1. Reconnaissance activities (gathering publicly available information on systems and conducting active discovery methods)
  2. Installation of malicious implants (like BlackEnergy 3)
  3. Communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers
  4. Employee-enabled macro execution

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the malicious implants (like BlackEnergy 3) will establish communication with C2 servers before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the malicious implants will not establish communication with C2 servers before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

Based on the typical attack sequence of a cyber attack using a malicious implant like BlackEnergy 3, the following is a plausible sequence:
1. The attacker conducts reconnaissance to gather information about the target network.
2. The attacker uses the gathered information to craft a targeted attack, which may include the use of a malicious document containing a macro that, when executed by an employee, installs the implant on the network.
3. Once the implant is installed, it typically establishes communication with the C2 servers to receive further instructions and to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities.

Given this typical sequence, the most plausible answer is that the communication with C2 servers would occur after the implant is installed on the network.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: Reconnaissance activities are conducted to gather information.
- Step 2: The malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) is installed on the network.
- Step 3: The installed implant establishes communication with the C2 servers.

Final Answer: B: No
