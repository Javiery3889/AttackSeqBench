Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has compromised SolarWinds and delivered the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack for initial access.
- The question asks whether the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The Sunburst backdoor is a sophisticated malware that was used in the SolarWinds attack. It is designed to provide persistent access to a network after initial compromise.
- Typically, a backdoor like Sunburst would not communicate with its C2 server before achieving initial access. The purpose of the backdoor is to establish a presence on the target network, and communication with the C2 server is part of the post-compromise phase, not the initial access phase.
- The initial access phase involves actions that allow the attacker to gain a foothold in the network, such as exploiting a vulnerability or using a supply-chain attack, which in this case is the delivery of the Sunburst backdoor.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access phase is focused on gaining entry into the network, not on establishing communication with a C2 server.
- The Sunburst backdoor's primary function is to communicate with its C2 server after it has established a presence on the target network.
- Therefore, it is not plausible that the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved.

Final Answer: B: No
