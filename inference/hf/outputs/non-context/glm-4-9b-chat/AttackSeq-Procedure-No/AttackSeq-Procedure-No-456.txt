1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving APT-TOCS, which gained initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that PowerShell scripts were utilized to run a credential harvesting tool in memory to evade defenses during the attack's core step, instead of Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that PowerShell scripts were used to run a credential harvesting tool in memory.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory instead of PowerShell scripts being used for credential harvesting.

   Given the context of the question, the use of PowerShell for initial access and remote control implies that the attackers are familiar with PowerShell and its capabilities. PowerShell scripts are versatile and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including running other scripts or tools in memory. Credential harvesting is a common objective for attackers, and using PowerShell to run a credential harvesting tool in memory would be a plausible TTP, as it allows for stealthy operation and can evade some defenses that are not designed to detect PowerShell-based attacks.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts, indicating a familiarity with PowerShell.
   - Step 2: PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to run other scripts or tools in memory, which is a common technique for evading defenses.
   - Step 3: Credential harvesting is a common objective for attackers, and using PowerShell for this purpose is a plausible TTP.
   - Step 4: The question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts were used for credential harvesting instead of Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory. Given the versatility of PowerShell and the common objectives of attackers, it is reasonable to assume that PowerShell could be used for credential harvesting.

Final Answer: A: Yes
