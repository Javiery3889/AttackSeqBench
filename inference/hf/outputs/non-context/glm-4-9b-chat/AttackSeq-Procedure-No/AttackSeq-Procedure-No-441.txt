Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where Waterbear's backdoor has been configured with an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address.
- The question then asks if it is likely that API hooking techniques will be used to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of API hooking techniques to modify specific functions in memory.
- API hooking is a technique used by malware to intercept function calls to APIs, which can be used to hide the malware's activities or to perform malicious actions.
- 'ZwOpenProcess' is a Windows API function used to open a handle to a process, which can be used by malware to interact with processes on the system.
- 'GetExtendedTcpTable' is a Windows API function used to retrieve information about TCP endpoints on the system, which can be used by malware to communicate with external entities.
- Given that the backdoor is already configured to communicate with external entities using encrypted channels, it is plausible that the attackers would use additional techniques to further evade detection.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of encryption and XOR-encryption for the C&C communication suggests that the attackers are attempting to hide their activities.
- Modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory is a common technique to interfere with process management and network communication, respectively.
- These functions are critical for malware to operate and communicate, and modifying them can help the malware evade detection by security tools that monitor these functions.
- Therefore, it is likely that API hooking techniques would be used to modify these functions to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
