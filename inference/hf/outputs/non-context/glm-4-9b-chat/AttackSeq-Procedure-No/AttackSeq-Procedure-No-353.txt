1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where a downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control (C2) phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware (C2 phase).
     2. PowerShell scripts download a Windows executable and a decoy document (Execution phase).
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download additional components during the execution phase.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that PowerShell scripts will download additional components during the execution phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial TTP mentioned is the downloader retrieving an image file containing encoded Asruex malware. This is a common initial step in many malware delivery processes.
   - Step 2: The next step is the execution phase, where the malware is intended to perform its malicious activities.
   - Step 3: Asruex malware is known to use PowerShell for its command and control activities. PowerShell scripts are often used to download additional payloads or components.
   - Step 4: Given that Asruex malware is designed to be modular and flexible, it is plausible that it would download additional components, such as a Windows executable and a decoy document, to further its malicious activities.
   - Step 5: The decoy document is a common technique used by attackers to mislead security analysts and hide the true malicious payload.

Final Answer: A: Yes
