Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack. The sequence is as follows:
  1. A phishing email is received with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document.
  2. The document contains a VBA macro that auto-opens.
  3. The VBA macro executes queries to gather system information.
  4. The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task.
  5. The scheduled task executes 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the VBA macro will use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information before establishing persistence.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the VBA macro will not use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information before establishing persistence.

Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of a COM (Component Object Model) object to execute queries is a common technique in malware to interact with the system without triggering antivirus software that might detect direct system calls.
- The sequence of actions described in the question implies a typical post-compromise behavior where the attacker first gathers information about the system to understand the environment and then establishes persistence.
- The use of 'mshta.exe' to execute a payload is also a common technique in malware to bypass security measures, as 'mshta.exe' is often allowed to run by security software due to its legitimate use.
- Given that the question describes a sequence of events that are typical of a post-compromise attack, it is plausible that the VBA macro would use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information before establishing persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
