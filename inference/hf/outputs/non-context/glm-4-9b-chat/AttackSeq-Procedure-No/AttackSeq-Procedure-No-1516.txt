1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have installed a backdoor that exfiltrates data over a Command and Control (C&C) channel using encrypted communication.
   - The follow-up action mentioned is the deployment of CaddyWiper to wipe files related to Operational Technology (OT) capabilities and physical drive partitions.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question are:
     1. Installation of a backdoor.
     2. Exfiltration of data over a C&C channel using encrypted communication.
     3. Deployment of CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that it is likely that the attackers would deploy CaddyWiper after exfiltrating data.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that it is not likely that the attackers would deploy CaddyWiper after exfiltrating data.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial action of the attackers is to install a backdoor, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to maintain persistence on the compromised system.
   - Step 2: The backdoor is used to exfiltrate data over a C&C channel using encrypted communication, which is a typical method to avoid detection and to ensure the data is transmitted securely.
   - Step 3: The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers would deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions. This step is less common in the context of data exfiltration, as the primary goal of exfiltration is to steal data rather than to destroy it.
   - Step 4: The deployment of CaddyWiper would be more indicative of a destructive or destructive-wiper attack, which is a different type of attack than a standard data exfiltration attack.

Final Answer: B: No

The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests a data exfiltration attack, and the deployment of a destructive tool like CaddyWiper to wipe files would be an unusual and less likely follow-up action in this context.
