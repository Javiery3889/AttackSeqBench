Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a Shellbot has gathered information about an infected host.
- The information gathered includes the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions.
- The question then asks whether the Shellbot is likely to push additional malicious tools onto the infected system to perform specific actions: steal user credentials, move laterally, and destroy data.

Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- Answer Choice A: Yes - This suggests that the Shellbot is likely to push additional malicious tools after gathering information.
- Answer Choice B: No - This suggests that the Shellbot is not likely to push additional malicious tools after gathering information.

To evaluate the plausibility of each answer choice:
- A Shellbot, which is a type of malware designed to create a botnet, typically has a goal to perform malicious activities on the infected systems.
- Gathering information about the infected host is a common initial step for malware to understand the environment and potential targets.
- Pushing additional malicious tools to steal credentials, move laterally, and destroy data aligns with the typical objectives of a Shellbot.

Step 3: Provide Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Shellbot's initial action of gathering information about the infected host is consistent with its goal to understand the environment and potential targets.
- The objectives of the Shellbot, as described in the question, are to steal credentials, move laterally, and destroy data, which are all plausible actions for a malware designed to create a botnet.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Shellbot would push additional malicious tools to achieve these objectives.

Final Answer: A: Yes
