 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the Collection phase after the Aria-body backdoor gathered extensive system information during the Discovery phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1113-Screen Capture involves capturing images of the screen, which might be useful for data exfiltration but doesn't directly support the collection of system information.
   - B: T1056-Input Capture involves monitoring and recording keystrokes, which could provide additional system information but is not directly related to the Collection phase.
   - C: T1564.002-Hidden Users could be used to create covert channels for data exfiltration, which aligns with the Collection phase.
   - D: T1057-Process Discovery is about identifying and gathering information about running processes, which is more related to the Discovery phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Aria-body backdoor has already gathered extensive system information during the Discovery phase. To support the Collection phase, the attacker would need a technique that allows for data exfiltration or further information gathering.
   - T1564.002-Hidden Users could be used to create covert channels for data exfiltration, making it the most plausible choice for the next step in the attack sequence.

Final Answer: C: T1564.002-Hidden Users.
