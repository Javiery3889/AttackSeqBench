 Final Answer: C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Dridex employs heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques to evade detection.
   - Afterward, it communicates data such as computer name and botnet ID number with its true Command and Control servers via encrypted POST requests.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol is about using common protocols for command and control but does not specify the use of encryption or non-standard encoding.
   - B: T1622-Debugger Evasion is about evading detection by debuggers, not about data communication.
   - C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding is about using non-standard encoding schemes to evade detection, which could be used to encrypt the data being sent.
   - D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations is not related to data communication or encryption.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Dridex employs heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques to evade detection (T1071.001-Initial Access, T1565.001-Obfuscated Files or Information, T1571-Code Signing, T1572-Debugging Tools, T1622-Debugger Evasion).
   - Afterward, it needs to communicate with its Command and Control servers. To do this securely, it uses encrypted POST requests.
   - To evade detection, it uses non-standard encoding (T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding) for the encrypted data.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - T1071.001-Initial Access (Dridex initial access)
