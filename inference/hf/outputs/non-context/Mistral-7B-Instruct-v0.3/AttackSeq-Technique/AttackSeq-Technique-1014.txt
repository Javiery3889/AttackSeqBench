 Final Answer: B: T1221-Template Injection

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated Gamaredon's initial compromise after receiving spearphishing emails.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries and T1204.003-Malicious Image are techniques related to persistence, not initial compromise.
   - T1221-Template Injection is a technique used to manipulate documents or emails to contain malicious content, which aligns with the scenario of receiving spearphishing emails.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that Gamaredon received spearphishing emails.
   - To exploit these emails, the attackers need to manipulate the content of the emails or documents to contain malicious code.
   - T1221-Template Injection is the technique used to manipulate templates, such as email templates, to contain malicious content.
   - Therefore, it is the most plausible technique that facilitated Gamaredon's initial compromise after receiving spearphishing emails.
