 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BlueBravo's malware gathers victim system information and then communicates bidirectionally with C2 servers using HTTPS protocol encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy involves using multiple proxy servers to mask the origin of traffic, which doesn't directly involve the use of application layer protocols or HTTPS with RC4 and Base64 encoding.
   - T1546.009-AppCert DLLs is about using legitimate signed executables to perform malicious activities, which doesn't involve bidirectional communication or specific encryption methods.
   - T1106-Native API is about using built-in operating system functions to execute commands, which doesn't directly involve the use of application layer protocols or specific encryption methods.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is about using common protocols for command and control, which includes HTTPS. The use of RC4 and Base64 encoding can be considered as part of the application layer protocol, as these are common methods for encrypting and encoding data at the application layer.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware gathers victim system information (T1086), which is a common pre-execution phase TTP.
   - After gathering the information, the malware establishes communication with the C2 server (T1071).
   - The communication is done using the Application Layer Protocol (HTTPS), encrypted with RC4 (a stream cipher often used in application layer protocols) and Base64 encoding (a method for encoding binary data, especially for transmission over 7-bit-transparent media).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1086 (Gather Victim System Information) -> T1071 (Application Layer Protocol). The specific encryption method used (RC4 and Base64) is not explicitly part of the ATT&CK framework, but it can be considered as part of the T1071 technique.
