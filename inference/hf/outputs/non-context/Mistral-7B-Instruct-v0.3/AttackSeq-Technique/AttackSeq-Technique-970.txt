 To answer this question, we need to understand the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question and compare them with the answer choices.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence where a backdoor (Aria-body) collected detailed host and network information, followed by gathering data on installed software.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1090.001-Internal Proxy and T1113-Screen Capture are not directly related to the discovery phase, which is the phase where an attacker gathers information about the target environment.
   - T1069.003-Cloud Groups seems unrelated to the sequence described, as it involves managing cloud resources, not gathering information about the local machine.
   - T1518-Software Discovery, on the other hand, is a technique used to gather information about the software installed on a target system, which is a common step in the discovery phase before collecting detailed host and network information.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker first collects detailed host and network information, then gathers data on installed software.
   - T1518-Software Discovery is a technique that fits well in this sequence, as it involves gathering information about the software installed on a target system, which could be a prerequisite for collecting detailed host and network information.

Final Answer: T1518-Software Discovery.
