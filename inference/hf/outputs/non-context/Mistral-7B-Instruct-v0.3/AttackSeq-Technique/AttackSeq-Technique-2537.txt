 Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where fake Japanese documents were used for initial access, and then malware retrieved encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1497.001-System Checks is a technique used to gather information about the target system, but it doesn't necessarily have to be performed before the malware retrieves C&C configuration information.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is a technique used to establish persistence on the compromised system, which would allow the malware to run at startup and potentially download the C&C configuration before the user logs in.
   - T1078.003-Local Accounts and T1102-Web Service are techniques related to account manipulation and web services, respectively, which don't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker gains initial access using fake Japanese documents (T1105).
   - To maintain persistence on the compromised system, the attacker uses T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution to ensure the malware runs at startup.
   - After establishing persistence, the malware can then retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs (T1086.003).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1105 (Initial Access) -> T1547 (Persistence) -> T1086.003 (Command and Control). However, the question asks for the technique most likely to have occurred before T1086.003, so the answer is T1547 (Persistence).
