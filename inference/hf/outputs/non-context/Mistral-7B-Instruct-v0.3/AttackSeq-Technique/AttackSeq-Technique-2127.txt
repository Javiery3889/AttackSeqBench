 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the attackers achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP to target servers.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: using scanning tools and stolen credentials for discovery, lateral movement by deploying RDP.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1114.002-Remote Email Collection is about exfiltrating emails from a remote system, which doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is about executing commands or scripts on a compromised host, but it doesn't necessarily have to precede lateral movement.
   - T1021-Remote Services is about exploiting remote services to gain access to a system, which could be used for initial access or lateral movement. However, it's more likely that this technique would be used after initial access for lateral movement, not before.
   - T1021.007-Cloud Services is about exploiting misconfigured or unpatched cloud services for initial access, which doesn't seem to be related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs suggests that the attackers first gained access to the system using scanning tools and stolen credentials (initial access).
   - After initial access, they would likely perform some actions on the compromised host, such as reconnaissance or privilege escalation, before moving laterally to other systems (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter could be one of these actions).
   - Therefore, it's more likely that the attackers used T1021-Remote Services for initial access, and T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter could have occurred after that, but before the lateral movement by deploying RDP.

Final Answer: The ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the attackers achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP is T1021-Remote Services.
