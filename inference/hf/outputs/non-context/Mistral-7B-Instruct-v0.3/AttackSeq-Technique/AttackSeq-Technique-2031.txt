 Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Duke group communicated securely with their C&C server, archived and transmitted sensitive information, and utilized legitimate cloud services.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol is not specific enough as it does not mention the use of web services or cloud services.
   - T1602-Data from Configuration Repository does not seem to align with the described sequence as it involves gathering data from configuration files, not exfiltrating sensitive information.
   - T1585.003-Cloud Accounts is about gaining access to cloud resources, not exfiltrating data.
   - T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service is the most plausible answer as it involves transmitting data over web services, which aligns with the described sequence of TTPs. The use of legitimate cloud services could be a part of this technique, as cloud services often provide web-based data storage and transfer solutions.
