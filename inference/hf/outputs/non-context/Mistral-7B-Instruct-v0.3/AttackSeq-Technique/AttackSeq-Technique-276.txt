 Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where URL shortening services are used to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker, followed by the execution of PowerShell scripts to drop additional files.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1659-Content Injection is a technique where an attacker injects malicious content into a legitimate website. However, it doesn't directly relate to the sequence described, as the URL shortening service is not a legitimate website.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel is a technique used to establish a secure communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. This technique doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence described, as it doesn't involve the execution of PowerShell scripts or the dropping of files.
   - T1133-External Remote Services is a technique where an attacker establishes a connection to a system from an external source. This technique could be used to download the PowerShell scripts and additional files, such as 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg', which aligns with the sequence described in the question.
   - T1584.005-Botnet is a technique where an attacker controls multiple compromised systems to perform a coordinated attack. While this could potentially involve the execution of PowerShell scripts, it doesn't directly explain the initial redirection through URL shortening services.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence where URL shortening services are used to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker. This suggests an initial step of external communication (T1105-Spearphishing Attachment).
   - The attacker then controls the domain to redirect to a malicious site (T1108-Web Delivery).
   - The malicious site then uses URL shortening services to further obfuscate the destination (T1036-Phishing URL).
   - The user is tricked into clicking the URL, which leads to the domain controlled by the attacker.
   - The attacker then uses T1133-External Remote Services to download and execute the PowerShell scripts and additional files.
