 Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file is executed to install the main payload. The question asks for the technique that facilitated the malware in executing the payload without triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1566-Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malicious content. It does not directly help in bypassing UAC.
   - B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism involves exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in software to execute code with elevated privileges. This technique can be used to bypass UAC, as it allows the malware to run with administrative rights, avoiding the UAC prompt.
   - C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs is a technique used to load a malicious DLL into the memory of a running process. While this can be used for persistence or code injection, it does not directly help in bypassing UAC.
   - D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data is not related to executing malware or bypassing UAC. It involves acquiring sensitive information or services through legal or illegal means.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the execution of a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file to install the main payload. This suggests that the malware has already gained some level of access to the system.
   - To bypass UAC and execute the payload without a prompt, the malware needs to exploit a vulnerability or misconfiguration in the system.
   - T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is the technique that best fits this scenario, as it involves exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to execute code with elevated privileges, bypassing the UAC prompt.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario would be:
   - Initial Access (T1078) -> Initial Foothold (T1055) -> T1566 (Phishing, if applicable) -> T1548 (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism) -> Command and Control (T1086) -> Execution (T1059) -> Persistence (T1070). The TTP T1548 is the one that most likely facilitated the malware in executing the payload without triggering a UAC pop-up.
