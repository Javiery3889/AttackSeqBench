 Final Answer: A: T1090-Proxy

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where exploits are delivered to victims through malvertising and redirecting users to exploit kit landing pages. Then, the RIG EK's infrastructure uses an API server through reverse proxy to VDS for Command and Control.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1090-Proxy involves the use of a proxy to bypass security controls and gain access to a target network. This technique can be used to establish a connection to the Command and Control server, which aligns with the RIG EK's infrastructure using an API server for Command and Control.
   - T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking is a technique used to manipulate the DNS resolution process to redirect traffic to malicious sites. While this technique can be used to deliver exploits, it does not directly relate to the Command and Control phase of the attack.
   - T1205-Traffic Signaling is a technique used to signal the attacker about the status of the attack or to communicate with the Command and Control server. However, it does not seem to be the initial step before establishing a connection to the Command and Control server.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel is a technique used to encrypt the communication between the attacker and the compromised host. This technique is more likely to be used after the initial connection to the Command and Control server has been established.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attack starts with delivering exploits to victims through malvertising and redirecting users to exploit kit landing pages (T1078).
   - After successful exploitation, the RIG EK is installed on the victim's machine, and it uses an API server through reverse proxy to VDS for Command and Control (T1086).
   - Before this step, it is likely that T1090-Proxy was used to bypass security controls and establish a connection to the Command and Control server. This is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the information provided in the question.
