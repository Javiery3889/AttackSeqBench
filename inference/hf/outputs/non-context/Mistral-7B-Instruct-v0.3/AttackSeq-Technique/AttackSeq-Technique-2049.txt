 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to facilitate movement within the target's networks after harvesting email credentials.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Harvesting email credentials (T1566.001)
     - Movement within the target's networks

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information is about collecting information about the victim, not facilitating movement within the network.
   - T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material is about using alternative credentials to authenticate, but it doesn't necessarily facilitate movement within the network.
   - T1547.015-Login Items is about executing a program automatically when a user logs in, which could be used to move laterally within the network, but it's not directly related to the initial credential harvesting.
   - T1072-Software Deployment Tools is about using tools to install or update software, but it doesn't directly relate to the movement within the network after credential harvesting.
   - However, T1021-Credential Dumping or T1087-Remote Desktop Services could be potential answers, as they involve using the harvested credentials to access other systems within the network, thus facilitating movement.
   - But since the question specifically asks for a technique that facilitates movement within the network, T1021-Credential Dumping is less likely, as it is more about accessing resources, not moving within the network.
   - T1087-Remote Desktop Services, on the other hand, is about exploiting remote desktop protocols for lateral movement, which aligns better with the question's context.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to facilitate movement within the target's networks after harvesting email credentials.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Harvesting email credentials (T1566.001)
     - Movement within the target's networks
   - T1087-Remote Desktop Services is the technique that best aligns with the question's context, as it involves using the harvested credentials to access and move within remote systems in the network.

Final Answer: T1087-Remote Desktop Services.
