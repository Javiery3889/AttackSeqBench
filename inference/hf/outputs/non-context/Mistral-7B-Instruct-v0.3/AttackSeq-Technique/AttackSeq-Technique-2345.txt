 Final Answer: C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a threat actor (BRONZE PRESIDENT) developed their own remote access tools and used PRC-linked infrastructure. They then used tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1566-Phishing is a technique used to deliver malware or trick users into revealing sensitive information. However, it doesn't necessarily involve the development of custom remote access tools or the use of PRC-linked infrastructure.
   - T1606.001-Web Cookies can be used to maintain persistence or track user activity, but it doesn't seem to be directly related to the development of custom tools or the use of PRC-linked infrastructure.
   - T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain involves the insertion of malicious components into legitimate software before it is distributed. This could potentially allow the attacker to gain access to a target's system before they deploy their custom tools, aligning with the sequence of events described in the question.
   - T1588-Obtain Capabilities is a high-level objective and doesn't specify a particular technique used to achieve it. It could occur at any point in the attack sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT developed their own remote access tools and used PRC-linked infrastructure. This suggests that they have the capabilities to execute attacks.
   - However, to gain access to a target's system, they would need a way to deliver their tools. One way to do this is by compromising a software supply chain, as mentioned in T1195.002.
   - Once they have gained access to the target's system, they can then deploy their custom remote access tools (Cobalt Strike and PlugX) for execution, as described in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1195.002 (Compromise Software Supply Chain) before T1087 (Active Directory Discovery) and T1055 (PowerShell) which lead to T1570 (Remote Services) and finally T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) where they can execute Cobalt Strike and PlugX.
