 Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after an obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe' and ensured detection was evaded by deleting itself post-execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1102-Web Service does not involve script execution or self-deletion, so it can be ruled out.
   - B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity is not related to script execution or self-deletion, so it can be ruled out.
   - C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications does not involve script execution or self-deletion, so it can be ruled out.
   - D: T1564-Hide Artifacts involves the deletion of files or other evidence to evade detection, which aligns with the described behavior of the script self-deleting post-execution.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe'. This action is associated with T1055.001-Scripting.
   - After execution, the script deleted itself to evade detection. This action is associated with T1564-Hide Artifacts.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1055.001-Scripting followed by T1564-Hide Artifacts. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the script execution, so the answer is T1564-Hide Artifacts.
