 Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving evading detections, using large null-padded files, and emitting network beacons with encrypted data.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution does not involve network beacons or encrypted data.
   - T1071.003-Mail Protocol does not mention large null-padded files or encrypted data.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol involves using various protocols for command and control, which could include emitting network beacons and could potentially use encrypted data for communication.
   - T1037.003-Network Logon Script does not involve emitting network beacons or encrypted data.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker first evaded detections through CPU core checks, which could be achieved by various means, but one common method is to use a technique like T1565-Process Injection or T1055-PowerShell. However, these techniques are not directly related to network beacons or encrypted data, so we need to look at the next TTP.
   - The attacker then utilized large null-padded files, which could be used for various purposes, such as hiding malicious content or evading detection. This TTP is not directly related to any specific ATT&CK technique.
   - The next TTP is emitting network beacons using hardcoded header values and encrypted data for communication with the server. This TTP is most likely associated with T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves using various protocols for command and control, which could include emitting network beacons and could potentially use encrypted data for communication.
