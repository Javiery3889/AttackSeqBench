 Final Answer: A: T1595-Active Scanning

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that most likely involved the use of tools for enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports before gaining initial access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1595-Active Scanning: This technique involves network reconnaissance to identify hosts, services, and operating systems on a network. It can also include port scanning, service enumeration, and brute force authentication attempts. This technique aligns best with the attack sequence mentioned in the question.
   - T1590.001-Domain Properties: This technique is about discovering and analyzing Active Directory domain configurations. It does not involve port scanning, service enumeration, or brute force authentication.
   - T1090.002-External Proxy: This technique is about using an external proxy to connect to a target network. It does not involve port scanning, service enumeration, or brute force authentication.
   - T1197-BITS Jobs: This technique is about using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) for data transfer. It does not involve port scanning, service enumeration, or brute force authentication.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks for the TTP that most likely involved the use of tools for enumerating services, authenticating via brute force, and scanning ports.
   - T1595-Active Scanning is the technique that includes all these activities. It is a common initial step in many attacks to gather information about the target network and hosts.
   - Therefore, T1595-Active Scanning is the most plausible sequence of TTPs before gaining initial access by remotely controlling software or creating new local accounts on internal hosts.
