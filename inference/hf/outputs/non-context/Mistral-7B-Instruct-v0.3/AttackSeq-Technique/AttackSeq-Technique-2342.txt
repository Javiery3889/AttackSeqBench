 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a PowerPoint add-in document containing a VBA macro is used to execute a malicious code. Then, the 'mshta.exe' tool is used to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1566-Phishing is a technique that involves delivering a malicious link or attachment through email, but it doesn't specify the use of a PowerPoint add-in or VBA macro.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is the technique that involves the execution of scripts or command-line interpreters to execute commands. However, it doesn't specify the initial delivery method of the script or interpreter.
   - T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique that manipulates the search order of DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of the intended one. This technique doesn't seem to be related to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - The sequence of events described in the question suggests that the PowerPoint add-in document was used to execute a VBA macro, which is a script. Then, 'mshta.exe' was used to download and execute a dropper. Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred before 'mshta.exe' was used is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, as it involves the execution of scripts.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: A PowerPoint add-in document containing a VBA macro was delivered to the victim.
   - Step 2: The VBA macro was executed, which triggered the execution of a script or command.
   - Step 3: The 'mshta.exe' tool was used to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
   - Final Answer: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter. This technique is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the 'mshta.exe' tool was used in the described attack sequence.
