 Final Answer: C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement. The question then asks for the ATT&CK technique that enabled them to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1552.008-Chat Messages does not involve exploiting systems remotely. It is a technique used for command and control communication.
   - B: T1573-Encrypted Channel could be used for communication, but it does not directly involve exploiting systems.
   - C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is a technique that involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain unauthorized access to a system. This aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, as it follows the use of webshells to tunnel RDP traffic (which could be used for lateral movement) and the need to exploit systems remotely.
   - D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares is a technique for executing commands and scripts on a compromised system, but it does not directly involve exploiting systems remotely.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The use of webshells to tunnel RDP traffic (T1086) is a method for establishing a connection to a system and potentially moving laterally within a network.
   - However, to exploit systems remotely, an attacker needs to find and exploit a vulnerability in the target system. This is where T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services comes in. By exploiting a remote service, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system, which aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - The other answer choices do not directly involve exploiting systems remotely, which is the focus of the question.
