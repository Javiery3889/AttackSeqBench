 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before lateral movement in a GreyEnergy attack, after spearphishing and server compromise.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - T1564-Hide Artifacts is a technique used to cover tracks and is not typically used before lateral movement.
   - T1217-Browser Information Discovery is not a common technique used in the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - T1195-Supply Chain Compromise is a technique used to gain initial access to a network, which could be before spearphishing and server compromise. However, the question specifies that servers have already been compromised, so T1195 is less likely.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question mentions that servers have already been compromised, which suggests that the attackers have gained initial access to the network.
   - T1195-Supply Chain Compromise is a technique used for initial access, but it's less likely given that servers have already been compromised. However, it's possible that the initial access was gained through a supply chain compromise, and then the attackers moved on to spearphishing and server compromise.
   - Therefore, it's more likely that T1195-Supply Chain Compromise occurred before the spearphishing and server compromise, but it's not the most plausible sequence given the information provided.
   - The most plausible sequence, given the information provided, would be: Initial Access (T1199 - Social Engineering) -> Initial Access (T1078 - Valid Accounts) -> Initial Access (T1087 - Exploit Public-Facing Application or Web Application) -> Initial Access (T1086 - Adobe Flash Player) -> Initial Access (T1055 - Remote Desktop Services) -> Initial Access (T1027 - Commonly Used Passwords) -> Initial Access (T1078 - Valid Accounts) -> Command and Control (T1071 - Remote Services) -> Discovery (T1086 - Adobe Flash Player) -> Discovery (T1087 - Network Service Discovery) -> Persistence (T1041 - System Restart) -> Defense Evasion (T1564 - Hide Artifacts) -> Lateral Movement (T1021 - Remote Desktop Protocol) -> Lateral Movement (T1077 - Network Service Scanning) -> Exfiltration (T1041 - System Restart) -> Exfiltration (T1042 - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel).
   - However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before they attempted lateral movement, so the answer would be T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, even though it's not the most plausible sequence given the information provided.

Final Answer: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise.
