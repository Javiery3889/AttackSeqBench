 Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a tool (Infamous Chisel) is used to collect files from the local system and application directories. The question then asks for the technique that most likely occurred to exfiltrate these files.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Option A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration involves the use of tools to exfiltrate data from a compromised system. This aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question, as it follows the collection of files with a subsequent exfiltration step.
   - Option B is a repetition of the same technique (T1020-Automated Exfiltration), which is not necessary as the question asks for the most likely technique, not multiple techniques.
   - Option C: T1614-System Location Discovery is not related to the exfiltration of collected files.
   - Option D: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood is a technique used to consume system resources, not related to data exfiltration.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the collection of files from the local system and application directories, which is a common TTP in data collection or reconnaissance phases.
   - After collecting the data, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to exfiltrate these files.
   - The technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration involves the use of tools to exfiltrate data from a compromised system, making it the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the collection of files.
