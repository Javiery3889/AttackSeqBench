 Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs initiated by Patchwork, starting with Initial Access (T1086) using exploited CVE-2017-8750 through malicious RTF documents.
   - The question then asks about the Reconnaissance phase, specifically identifying targeted recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT are techniques related to Scripting and Execution, not Reconnaissance.
   - B: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases is a technique used to gather information about a target's network, not about individuals.
   - C: T1598-Phishing for Information is a technique used to gather information about individuals, which aligns with the question's requirement of identifying targeted recipients.
   - D: T1204-User Execution is a technique related to Initial Access or Execution, not Reconnaissance.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After gaining Initial Access through exploiting CVE-2017-8750, Patchwork would need to identify the targeted recipients for their spear phishing emails.
   - Sending spear phishing emails without knowing the recipients would be ineffective, so it is logical that Patchwork would first gather information about the targeted individuals.
   - T1598-Phishing for Information is a technique used to gather information from individuals, making it the most plausible choice for the Reconnaissance phase in this scenario.
