 Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tropic Trooper gained initial access through exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).
   - The question then asks about the technique that occurred when the backdoor's installer was executed, which leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel and T1564.009-Resource Forking do not involve user action or interaction to trigger the deployment of a backdoor.
   - T1648-Serverless Execution is a technique where the attacker executes code on a host without the use of a traditional server, but it does not require user action or interaction to trigger the execution.
   - T1204-User Execution is a technique where the attacker gets the user to execute the malicious code, which aligns with the description in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Tropic Trooper gained initial access through exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).
   - After gaining access, the backdoor's installer was executed.
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred when the installer was executed, which leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment.
   - T1204-User Execution is the technique where the attacker gets the user to execute the malicious code, which fits the description in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - T1078.001-Initial Access (Tropic Trooper exploited EQNEDT32.EXE)
   - T1086-PowerShell (assuming the backdoor's installer was a PowerShell script)
   - T1204-User Execution (the user executed the backdoor's installer)
