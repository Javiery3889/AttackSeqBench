 Final Answer: A: T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker first performs discovery using in-memory execution of tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit.
   - Then, the attacker establishes command and control by deploying an inline hook on an IIS request validation function (TG1021).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1555.004-Windows Credential Manager involves the attacker harvesting credentials from the Windows Credential Manager, which can be used for lateral movement or establishing command and control. This TTP could provide the attacker with the necessary credentials to perform TG1021.
   - T1070-Indicator Removal is about removing indicators of compromise, which does not directly help in establishing command and control.
   - T1563.002-RDP Hijacking is about hijacking RDP sessions, which is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material involves using alternative authentication methods, which does not seem to be a prerequisite for TG1021.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attacker first performs discovery using SharpHound and PowerSploit (T1555.004) to gather information about the network and potential targets.
   - With the gathered information, the attacker can then use the harvested credentials to establish command and control by deploying an inline hook on an IIS request validation function (TG1021).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1555.004 -> TG1021.
