 Final Answer: A: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an exploit (CVE-2019-19781 Citrix) is deployed to gain initial access to a system.
   - After gaining initial access, APT29 (also known as "The Dukes") is said to maintain persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials and using anonymizing services.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1556.007-Hybrid Identity involves the use of both valid accounts and stolen credentials to maintain access to a system. This technique aligns with the scenario where APT29 obtained legitimate credentials.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel, T1659-Content Injection, and T1078-Valid Accounts do not directly relate to the process of obtaining legitimate credentials.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access (T1078) is achieved through the deployment of the public exploit (CVE-2019-19781 Citrix).
   - To maintain persistent access, APT29 needs to obtain legitimate credentials (T1556.007). This technique allows them to blend in with normal system activity, making their presence less conspicuous.
   - After obtaining legitimate credentials, APT29 can use anonymizing services (not explicitly mentioned in the question, but a common practice for APT groups to mask their true identity) to further obfuscate their activities.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Initial Access (T1078)
   - Credential Dumping/Mining (T1003) or Credential Aspirations (T1087) to obtain legitimate credentials
   - T1556.007-Hybrid Identity (using the obtained legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access)
   - T1021-Anonymization (using anonymizing services to mask their true identity)
