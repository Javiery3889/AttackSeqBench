 Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the OceanLotus Group's expansion within the network during Operation Cobalt Kitty.
   - The question mentions that the group harvested credentials from compromised machines, and before utilizing Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks for further network infection, they used another technique.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1546.008-Accessibility Features does not seem to be directly related to the expansion within the network after credential harvesting.
   - B: T1070-Indicator Removal is about removing evidence of the attack, which does not help in expanding the attack within the network.
   - D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to a system, but it does not seem to be a logical step after credential harvesting and before using Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks.
   - C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material involves using stolen credentials or other authentication material to gain access to systems. This technique could facilitate the expansion within the network by allowing the attacker to move laterally using the harvested credentials before resorting to Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The OceanLotus Group harvested credentials from compromised machines (T1087).
   - To expand within the network, they would need to use these credentials to access other systems (T1550).
   - After gaining access, they could use Windows built-in tools or pass-the-hash attacks for further network infection (T1026, T1077).
   - Therefore, T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that facilitated the OceanLotus Group's expansion within the network during Operation Cobalt Kitty.
