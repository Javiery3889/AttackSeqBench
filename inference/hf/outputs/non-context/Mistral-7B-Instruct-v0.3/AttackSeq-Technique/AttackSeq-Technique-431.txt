 Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely secures communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.
   - The Delphi downloader has already gathered system information and sent it to the C&C server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1595-Active Scanning is a technique used for network discovery, not for securing communication.
   - C: T1071.004-DNS is a technique used for command and control, but it doesn't necessarily secure the communication channel.
   - D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow is not related to securing communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.
   - B: T1573-Encrypted Channel is a technique used to secure communication by encrypting the data transmitted between two systems. This technique is most likely used to secure the communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server after the system information has been sent.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After the Delphi downloader gathers system information and sends it to the C&C server, it is likely that the attacker would want to secure the communication channel to prevent the information from being intercepted.
   - Encrypting the communication channel is a common method used to secure data in transit.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1086 (Initial Access) -> T1055 (Command and Control) -> T1567 (Download a File) -> T1004 (Gather System Information) -> T1573 (Encrypted Channel).
   - Since the question asks for the technique that secures communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server, the most likely answer is T1573-Encrypted Channel.
