 Final Answer: C: T1614-System Location Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to collect geo-location data from an iOS 7 device after the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1132-Data Encoding is a technique for encoding data to evade detection, not for collecting geo-location data.
   - T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules is a technique for using third-party authentication methods, not related to geo-location data collection.
   - T1033-System Owner/User Discovery is a technique for identifying system or user information, not directly related to geo-location data collection.
   - T1614-System Location Discovery is a technique for collecting geo-location data from a system, which aligns best with the attack sequence in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background, it is likely that the attacker wants to maintain persistence on the device and collect valuable data.
   - Geo-location data is valuable for various purposes, such as tracking the device or its user, or for targeted attacks based on the location.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
     - T1086-PowerShell: To hide the XAgent app icon and run it in the background.
     - T1614-System Location Discovery: To collect geo-location data from the device.
   - The other techniques listed in the answer choices do not fit this sequence or the context of the question.
