 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the 'Red October' campaign and the purpose of hiding the location of the 'mothership' server.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that the main component established communication with C&C servers and received additional spy modules.
   - The purpose is to hide the location of the 'mothership' server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is about executing commands or scripts on the victim's system, but it doesn't directly help in hiding the C&C server's location.
   - B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver is used to retrieve data from a pre-established location, not for hiding the C&C server's location.
   - C: T1090-Proxy can be used to establish a connection to a remote system while hiding the origin of the connection, which aligns with the purpose of hiding the 'mothership' server's location.
   - D: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL is used to inject code into the Winlogon process, but it doesn't help in hiding the C&C server's location.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The 'Red October' campaign used a complex network of servers, and hiding the 'mothership' server's location would be crucial to maintain the covert nature of the operation.
   - T1090-Proxy, which is used to establish a connection to a remote system while hiding the origin of the connection, is the most plausible technique that could have been used to hide the 'mothership' server's location during the 'Red October' campaign.

Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy.
