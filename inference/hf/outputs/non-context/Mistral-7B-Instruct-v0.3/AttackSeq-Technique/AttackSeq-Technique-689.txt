 Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the execution of the Pierogi backdoor via an embedded macro in Microsoft Word documents. The question then asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to ensure the backdoor would run upon user login.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL involves the use of a DLL in a Terminal Services session to execute code. This technique doesn't directly relate to running code upon user login.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution involves the execution of a file at system startup or user login. This technique aligns well with the scenario described in the question, as it would ensure the Pierogi backdoor runs upon user login.
   - T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service is about exfiltrating data over web services, which doesn't directly relate to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.
   - T1098.005-Device Registration is about registering devices with a C&C server, which also doesn't directly relate to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Pierogi backdoor is executed via an embedded macro in Microsoft Word documents.
   - To ensure the backdoor runs upon user login, the attacker would need to set up the backdoor to start automatically when the user logs in.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the technique that involves the execution of a file at system startup or user login, which aligns well with the scenario described in the question.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
     - T1136.001 - Spearphishing Attachment (to deliver the Microsoft Word document with the embedded macro)
     - T1203 - Exploit Public-Facing Application (to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Word to execute the macro)
     - T1055 - Command-Line Interface (to execute the Pierogi backdoor)
     - T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (to ensure the Pierogi backdoor runs upon user login)
