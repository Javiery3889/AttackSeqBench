 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware sends system information to a C2 server using the command line and HTTPS with a POST method.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver is a technique used for exfiltrating data from a dead drop, not for sending system information to a C2 server.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique that involves using application layer protocols for command and control, which aligns with the described sequence of TTPs as it includes the use of HTTPS.
   - T1072-Software Deployment Tools is a technique used for delivering and installing malware, not for communication with a C2 server.
   - T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance is a technique used for reverting cloud instances to a known state, not for communication with a C2 server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware sent system information to a C2 server using the command line, which suggests that it is communicating with the C2 server.
   - The communication with the C2 server is done using HTTPS with a POST method, which indicates that an application layer protocol is being used for the communication.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique that best aligns with the described sequence of TTPs as it involves using application layer protocols for command and control.
