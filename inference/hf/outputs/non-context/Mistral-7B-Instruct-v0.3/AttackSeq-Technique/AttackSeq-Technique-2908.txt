 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used by APT15 for remote access to a network before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - APT15 might have used various techniques to gain initial access, but for remote access, techniques like T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1133 (External Remote Services), T1078.003 (Local Accounts exploitation), and T1078.004 (Cloud Accounts) could be plausible.
   - However, the question specifies that the remote access happened before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor, which suggests that they used a technique that doesn't require a persistent communication channel like RoyalDNS.
   - Among the given options, T1078.003 (Local Accounts exploitation) seems the most plausible as it involves exploiting local accounts to gain remote access, which doesn't require a persistent communication channel like a backdoor.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Reasoning: APT15 might have gained initial access through various means, but for remote access before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor, they would need a method that doesn't require a persistent communication channel.
   - Local Accounts exploitation (T1078.003) fits this description as it involves exploiting local accounts to gain remote access, which doesn't require a persistent communication channel.
   - Final Answer: T1078.003-Local Accounts exploitation.
