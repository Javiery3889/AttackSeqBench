 Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that facilitated FIN4's anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure after transmitting stolen credentials.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Gather Victim Identity Information (T1589) is about collecting information about the victim, not facilitating communication.
   - DNS (T1590.002) is a technique used for resolving hostnames to IP addresses, not for maintaining anonymity in communication.
   - Port Knocking (T1205.001) is a method of establishing a connection to a service by sending a specific sequence of TCP packets to unopened ports, which is not typically used for maintaining anonymity.
   - Proxy (T1090) is a technique used to establish a connection to a remote system through an intermediary, which can help maintain anonymity by hiding the origin of the connection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that FIN4 transmitted stolen credentials to their C2 servers. This suggests that they have already established a connection with their C2 infrastructure.
   - To maintain anonymity in further communication, they would need a method to hide their origin. Using a proxy (T1090) would allow them to do this by routing their communication through an intermediary.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is T1090-Proxy.
