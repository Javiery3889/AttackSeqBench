 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. The attackers first avoided writing the RAT payload to disk, which suggests they used a technique to keep it in memory. This aligns with the T1105 - Data from an External Location (In-Memory) technique.

However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before they connected to their control server associated with the domain chickenkiller.com. Since we don't have information about the steps before the RAT payload was kept in memory, we can't definitively answer the question with the given information.

But if we were to speculate based on common attack sequences, we might consider techniques that help the attackers establish command and control (C2) channels. For example, T1071 - Application Layer Protocol, T1086 - PowerShell, or T1105.001 - Data from an External Location (C2 Beacon) could be potential candidates. Among these, T1105.001 - Data from an External Location (C2 Beacon) seems the most plausible as it involves the use of an external location (the control server) and a beaconing technique, which could be used to establish a C2 channel.

Final Answer: Without more information, it's not possible to definitively answer the question. However, if we were to speculate, the most plausible answer would be T1105.001 - Data from an External Location (C2 Beacon).
