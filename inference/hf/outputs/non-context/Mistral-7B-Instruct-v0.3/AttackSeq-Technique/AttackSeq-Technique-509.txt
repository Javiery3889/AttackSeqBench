 Final Answer: A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor archived collected data in a custom storage file format. The question asks for the most likely technique used to transfer the data from the victim's system.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB involves transferring data from an infected system to an external storage device, such as a USB drive. This technique is often used for data exfiltration, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.
   - T1129-Shared Modules refers to the use of external libraries, loaders, or dropper programs to deliver malware. This technique does not directly involve data transfer from the victim's system.
   - T1590.001-Domain Properties is about modifying Active Directory objects or their properties. This technique does not relate to data exfiltration from the victim's system.
   - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel involves sending data to a command and control server. While this could be a possible method for exfiltration, the question specifically mentions a custom storage file format, which suggests a more local method of data transfer, such as USB.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor archived data in a custom storage file format.
   - To transfer this data from the victim's system, the most likely technique would be to use an external storage device, such as a USB drive, which aligns with T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB.
   - Other techniques, such as T1129-Shared Modules, T1590.001-Domain Properties, and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, do not directly involve the transfer of data in a custom storage file format from the victim's system.
