 Final Answer: T1574.002-Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions defense evasion techniques (T1027: Defensive Evasion) such as redirecting victims to legitimate services (T1218: Data Obfuscation) and using domain shortening services (T1036: Phishing: Domain Spoofing).
   - The question also mentions the goal of accessing credentials through phishing pages impersonating login portals (T1566.002-Phishing: Credential Harvesting).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1003.004-LSA Secrets is a technique for obtaining credentials stored in the Local Security Authority (LSA) Secrets database, which is not directly related to phishing or credential harvesting.
   - B: T1090-Proxy is a technique for initial access to a system by using a proxy to bypass firewalls and other security controls, but it does not involve phishing or credential harvesting.
   - C: T1587-Develop Capabilities is a technique for developing custom tools or techniques to perform an attack, but it does not involve phishing or credential harvesting.
   - D: T1574.002-Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment is a technique for delivering a phishing message with a malicious attachment, which aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. The defense evasion techniques (T1218 and T1036) could be used to make the phishing email more convincing, and the goal (T1566.002) could be achieved by the malicious attachment containing a phishing page impersonating a login portal.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question mentions defense evasion techniques (T1027) such as redirecting victims to legitimate services (T1218) and using domain shortening services (T1036). These techniques could be used to make a phishing email more convincing by making the URLs appear legitimate.
   - The question also mentions the goal of accessing credentials through phishing pages impersonating login portals (T1566.002). This goal could be achieved by including a malicious attachment in the phishing email (T1574.002).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1027.001-Defensive Evasion (T1218 and T1036), T1574.002-Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment, and T1566.002-Phishing: Credential Harvesting.
