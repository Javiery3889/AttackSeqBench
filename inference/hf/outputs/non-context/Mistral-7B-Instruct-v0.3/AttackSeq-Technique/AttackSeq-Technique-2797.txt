 Final Answer: B: T1204-User Execution

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the sequence of events as follows: XAgent malware execution, hiding the app icon, automatic restart, and then the collection of information (contact lists, text messages, Wi-Fi status) sent via POST to the command and control server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1057-Process Discovery is about discovering information about running processes on a system. This technique does not directly relate to the sequence of events described, as the malware is already executed before this action would occur.
   - T1204-User Execution is about the execution of a file, script, or application by a user. This technique aligns well with the initial execution of the XAgent malware.
   - T1012-Query Registry is about querying the registry for keys or values. This technique is more related to Windows systems, and it's less likely to be used on iOS 7 for the given scenario.
   - T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules is about using PAMs to authenticate users or processes. This technique does not seem to be directly related to the sequence of events described.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the sequence of events as follows: XAgent malware execution, hiding the app icon, automatic restart, and then the collection of information sent via POST to the command and control server.
   - To find the most likely technique that occurred before the collection of information, we need to look for a technique that would allow the malware to execute and gain access to the system.
   - T1204-User Execution is the technique that best fits this description, as it involves the execution of a file, script, or application by a user. In this case, the user (or the compromised device) executes the XAgent malware, allowing it to perform its actions, including hiding the app icon and collecting information.
   - The other techniques (T1057, T1012, and T1556.003) do not seem to be directly related to the sequence of events described or are less likely to be used on iOS 7 for the given scenario.
