 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking, created a hidden directory, and then injected a backdoor DLL into the legitimate process dllhost.exe for Defense Evasion.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1070-Indicator Removal is about removing or modifying indicators of compromise to evade detection, which doesn't seem to be a precursor to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning is a technique used to redirect network traffic, which doesn't seem to be related to the sequence of TTPs described.
   - T1055-Process Injection is a technique where an attacker injects code into a running process, which could be a precursor to injecting the backdoor DLL into dllhost.exe. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the DLL hijacking.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is about executing commands or scripts using a legitimate interpreter, which doesn't seem to be a precursor to the described sequence of TTPs.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with DLL hijacking, which is a technique used to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process. This suggests that the attacker first needed to have control over the legitimate process (sidebar.exe in this case) to replace the legitimate DLL with a malicious one.
   - To gain control over a process, an attacker might use T1055-Process Injection to inject a malicious process or code into the legitimate process. This would give the attacker the ability to replace the legitimate DLL with a malicious one, as described in the question.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is T1055-Process Injection, as it seems to be a logical precursor to the DLL hijacking technique used in the sequence of TTPs described.

Final Answer: T1055-Process Injection.
