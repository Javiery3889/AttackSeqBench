 Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that APT28 used to move deeper into victim networks after exploiting internet-facing servers and employing OLDBAIT (T1108).
   - Harvesting credentials via spear-phishing (T1192) and OLDBAIT are initial access and establishment techniques, while T1564-Hide Artifacts is a post-exploitation technique for cleaning up traces of the attack. T1021.007-Cloud Services is a technique for exfiltrating data, not for moving deeper into the network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is a technique that involves exploiting known vulnerabilities in applications or operating systems to gain unauthorized access to a system. This technique aligns best with the attack sequence in the question, as it allows APT28 to move deeper into the network following the exploitation of internet-facing servers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: APT28 harvested credentials via spear-phishing (T1192), allowing them to gain initial access to a victim's network.
   - Step 2: APT28 employed OLDBAIT (T1108) to lure the victim into executing a malicious payload.
   - Step 3: After gaining initial access, APT28 exploited a vulnerability in an internet-facing server (implied in the question) to move deeper into the victim's network. This action aligns best with T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
   - Step 4: Further actions, such as T1564-Hide Artifacts or T1021.007-Cloud Services, may have been taken, but the question asks for the technique that allowed APT28 to move deeper into the network following the exploitation of internet-facing servers. Therefore, T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is the most plausible answer.
