 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question and the role each TTP plays in the attack sequence.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host. This is an initial step in an attack sequence.
   - The stolen screenshots were uploaded to the C2 infrastructure, which is a later step in the attack sequence.
   - The answer choices provide techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework that could potentially occur between these two steps.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method is about creating an archive or compressed file. This technique doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - T1113-Screen Capture is about capturing screenshots. This technique could be used to gather information after the arbitrary code execution but before the screenshots are uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.
   - T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks is about monitoring user activity. This technique doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is about establishing persistence on the compromised host. This technique could be used after the arbitrary code execution to ensure the malware persists and runs again on system boot, but it doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question regarding the upload of screenshots.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question mentions that KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host, which is an initial step in an attack sequence.
   - The stolen screenshots were uploaded to the C2 infrastructure, which is a later step in the attack sequence.
   - T1113-Screen Capture is about capturing screenshots, a technique that could be used to gather information after the arbitrary code execution but before the screenshots are uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.

Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture.
