 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability to install malware, followed by Taidoor beaconing to a CnC server using an HTTP GET request pattern.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol is about using encrypted protocols for exfiltration, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools is about manipulating software development tools to introduce malicious code, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - C: T1566-Phishing is about using email attachments or web links to trick users into installing malware, but it's not mentioned in the sequence described in the question.
   - D: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API is about querying cloud service metadata for information, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

   However, we can infer that after installing the malware, the malware would likely establish a connection back to its command and control server. T1086-PowerShell, T1087-PowerShell Empire, or T1088-Remote Services could be possible choices for this step. But since the question specifically mentions an HTTP GET request pattern, T1080-Tactics > T1105.001-Command and Control > T1105.002-External Remote Services > T1105.003-Web Services is the most plausible choice as it involves using web services for command and control, which could use an HTTP GET request pattern.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to install malware on the target's system (T1190).
   - Step 2: Before Taidoor beaconing to a CnC server using an HTTP GET request pattern, it is likely that the malware established a connection to its command and control server using web services (T1080 > T1105.002 > T1105.003).

Final Answer: T1105.003-Web Services.
