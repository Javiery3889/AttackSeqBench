 Final Answer: A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker sets up communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers using a custom cryptographic protocol. The question then asks for the most likely technique used during the external communication process to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1027.011-Fileless Storage involves the use of a fileless technique to store data in memory, which can be used for communication with C&C servers. This technique allows the attacker to avoid detection by not leaving any files on the system.
   - T1029-Scheduled Transfer involves the use of tools to automatically transfer data to an external location at a specified time. While this technique can be used for communication, it does not necessarily provide the operational security and avoidance of detection that the question asks for, as scheduled transfers can be detected by monitoring network traffic.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel is about establishing encrypted communication channels, which is what the question describes, but it does not necessarily provide operational security or avoidance of detection, as encrypted channels can still be detected if the communication pattern is unusual or if the encryption is weak.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the use of a custom cryptographic protocol, which is a method of encrypting communication to maintain confidentiality.
   - T1027.011-Fileless Storage involves the use of a fileless technique to store data in memory, which can be used for communication with C&C servers. This technique allows the attacker to avoid detection by not leaving any files on the system, which aligns with the goal of maintaining operational security and avoiding detection.
   - T1029-Scheduled Transfer and T1573-Encrypted Channel do not provide the same level of operational security and avoidance of detection as T1027.011-Fileless Storage, as they involve the transfer of data at a specific time or the use of a known encryption method, respectively, which can be detected.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - T1027.011-Fileless Storage (to store the communication data in memory)
   - T1041-Command and Control (to establish communication with the C&C server using the custom cryptographic protocol)
   - T1029-Scheduled Transfer or T1573-Encrypted Channel (for further communication, but these are less likely to provide the operational security and avoidance of detection as T1027.011-Fileless Storage)
