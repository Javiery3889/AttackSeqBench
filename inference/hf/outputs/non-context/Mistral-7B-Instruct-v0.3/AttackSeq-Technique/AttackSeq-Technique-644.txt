 Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used for deploying tools such as custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs after initial access through spear-phishing emails.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates is about using a legitimate digital certificate to sign malicious files, which doesn't directly involve deploying tools.
   - T1588-Obtain Capabilities is about acquiring additional capabilities, such as tools, credentials, or access to resources, which aligns with the activity of deploying custom-built backdoors and RATs.
   - T1491.001-Internal Defacement is about modifying web pages or websites controlled by the organization, which doesn't directly relate to deploying tools.
   - T1566-Phishing is about using email spoofing or false webpages to initiate an attack, which is the initial step, not the deployment of tools.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that Moafee and DragonOK have already gained initial access through spear-phishing emails.
   - After gaining initial access, they are deploying tools such as custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs to support their campaigns.
   - T1588-Obtain Capabilities is the technique that best aligns with this activity, as it involves acquiring additional capabilities, such as tools, which is what Moafee and DragonOK are doing.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - T1566-Phishing (Initial Access)
   - T1588-Obtain Capabilities (Deploying tools)
