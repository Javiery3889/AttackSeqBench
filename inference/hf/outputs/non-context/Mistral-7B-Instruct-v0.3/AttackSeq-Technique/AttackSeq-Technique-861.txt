 Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where TG-3279 established beachheads, used compromised credentials, and added scheduled system tasks. Afterward, C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic is mentioned.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols does not involve the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication.
   - B: T1595-Active Scanning is not related to C2 communication or the use of non-standard ports.
   - C: T1571-Non-Standard Port involves the use of non-standard ports for communication, which aligns with the described scenario.
   - D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure is about obtaining infrastructure for further operations, not about C2 communication using a specific port.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - TG-3279 established beachheads and added scheduled system tasks, which suggests initial access and persistence (T1086 and T1053).
   - They used compromised credentials from pwdump6, indicating credential dumping (T1003).
   - Afterward, C2 communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic is mentioned. This suggests the use of a non-standard port for communication, which aligns with T1571-Non-Standard Port.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1086, T1053, T1003, T1571.
