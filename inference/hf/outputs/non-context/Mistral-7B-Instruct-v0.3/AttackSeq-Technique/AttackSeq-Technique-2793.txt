 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the collection of sensitive information (T1086) and the encoding of that information in Base64 (T1132). The question asks for the most likely technique that occurred to send the information out.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1086 (Command and Control) and T1132 (Data Encoding) are both involved in the process of collecting and preparing the data for exfiltration. However, T1090.004 (Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Misconfiguration) and T1195.001 (Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools) are not directly related to sending the data out.
   - T1614 (System Location Discovery) is not related to sending data out, but it could be part of the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - T1132 (Data Encoding) is the technique that encodes the data, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's the technique that sends the data out.
   - T1132 in combination with a technique that focuses on data exfiltration would be the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - First, the attacker collects sensitive information (T1086).
   - Then, the attacker encodes the collected data in Base64 (T1132) to make it less recognizable.
   - To send the encoded data out, the attacker could use various techniques such as T1071 (Network Service Scanning), T1055 (Remote Access Tools), or T1080 (Physical Access Tools). However, the question does not provide information about the method of data exfiltration, so we can't definitively say which technique was used for that part.
   - Since the question asks for the technique most likely to send the information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix, we can't definitively answer that question without more information. However, we can say that T1132 (Data Encoding) is the most likely technique to have occurred before the data was sent out.

Final Answer: T1132-Data Encoding. (This answer choice is the most likely technique that occurred to prepare the data for exfiltration, but we can't definitively say which technique was used to send the data out based on the information provided in the question.)
