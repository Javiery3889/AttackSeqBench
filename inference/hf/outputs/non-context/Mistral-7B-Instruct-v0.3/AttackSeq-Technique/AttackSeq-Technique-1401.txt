 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with gaining initial access through spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545. The question then asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before TidePool achieved persistence.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1559-Inter-Process Communication, T1053.005-Scheduled Task, and T1566-Phishing are techniques that could be used at various stages of an attack, but not necessarily before persistence is established.
   - T1553-Subvert Trust Controls, on the other hand, is a technique that could be used to establish a foothold in the system before persistence is achieved. This technique could be used to set up a mechanism for further actions, such as TidePool's ActiveSetup key persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attacker first gains initial access through spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545.
   - After gaining access, the attacker would likely want to establish a foothold in the system to maintain access even if the initial point of entry is discovered and closed.
   - Subverting trust controls (T1553) could be a plausible technique to achieve this, as it allows an attacker to bypass security controls and establish a mechanism for persistence.
   - After subverting trust controls, the attacker could then set up persistence using TidePool and the ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry (as mentioned in the question).

Final Answer: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls.
