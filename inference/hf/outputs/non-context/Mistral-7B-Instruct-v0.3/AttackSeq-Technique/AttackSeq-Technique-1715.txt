 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that facilitated communication between Mustang Panda (the attacker) and compromised systems.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are spearphishing (initial access), using malicious '.lnk' files, and the double extension trick (defense evasion).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique used for command and control (C2) communication, which is a common method for attackers to communicate with compromised systems.
   - T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding is a technique used for obfuscating data, not for communication.
   - T1010-Application Window Discovery is a technique used for discovering running applications, not for communication.
   - T1566-Phishing is a technique used for initial access, not for communication.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Spearphishing is used to gain initial access to a system.
   - The double extension trick is used to evade detection by antivirus software.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker needs a method to communicate with the compromised system. This is where T1071-Application Layer Protocol comes into play, as it is a common technique for command and control communication.
   - The other answer choices do not align with the sequence of TTPs or the purpose of facilitating communication between the attacker and compromised systems.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing (T1192) using malicious '.lnk' files
   - Defense Evasion: Double Extension Trick (T1133)
   - Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
