 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker (Turla) has already established persistence on a system by placing a custom executable in the Startup folder (T1547.001). The question then asks about the next likely TTP used by Turla to elevate privileges within the system.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is not directly related to privilege escalation. It involves using application layer protocols for exfiltration, command and control, or other post-compromise activities.
   - T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading is a technique where an attacker injects a DLL into a running process to gain unauthorized access to resources. This could potentially be used for privilege escalation.
   - T1027.004-Compile After Delivery is about the attacker compiling a binary on the victim's system after delivery, which is not directly related to privilege escalation.
   - T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation is the technique of exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher privileges. This could be a plausible next step after establishing persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Given that Turla has already established persistence on the system, the next logical step would be to escalate privileges to gain more access. Among the given options, T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation is the technique most likely to be used for this purpose.

Final Answer: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation.
