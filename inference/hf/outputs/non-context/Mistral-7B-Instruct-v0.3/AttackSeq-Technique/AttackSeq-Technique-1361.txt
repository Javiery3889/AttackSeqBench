 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an exploit (CVE-2015-5119) is used to save and execute a malicious executable (%Temp%/Rdws.exe), which then retrieves a second-stage PlugX file. The question then asks about the technique that facilitated communication with C2 domains.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1001.002-Steganography is a technique used to conceal the existence of communications or data within an unaltered cover object. This technique does not seem to be related to the communication between the malware and C2 domains.
   - C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise is a technique where a user is tricked into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious file, which then installs malware. This technique does not seem to be directly related to the communication between the malware and C2 domains.
   - D: T1005-Data from Local System is a technique where an attacker exfiltrates data from a compromised system. This technique does not seem to be directly related to the communication between the malware and C2 domains.
   - B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique where an attacker employs protocols to communicate with the C2 server. This technique seems to be the most plausible as it directly relates to the communication between the malware (PlugX) and the C2 domain (inocnation[.]com).

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the execution of a malicious executable (Rdws.exe) that retrieves a second-stage PlugX file.
   - After the PlugX file is retrieved, it needs to communicate with the C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique that involves using protocols to communicate with the C2 server. This technique is most likely used by the PlugX malware to communicate with the C2 domain (inocnation[.]com).
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
