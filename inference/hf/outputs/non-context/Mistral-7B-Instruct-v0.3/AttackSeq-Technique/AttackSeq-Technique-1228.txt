 Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where spear phishing is used to deliver a payload, followed by an attack that leverages a year-old Office vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, to gain access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a publicly accessible application. In this case, the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office Equation Editor. Since the attackers are leveraging this vulnerability to gain access, T1190 is the most plausible answer.
   - T1134.002-Create Process with Token is about creating a new process using an existing token, which doesn't directly involve exploiting a vulnerability or leveraging a phishing attack.
   - T1598-Phishing for Information is about gathering information through phishing, but it doesn't describe the method of gaining access to the system, which is the focus of the question.
   - T1133-External Remote Services is about exploiting remote services, but it doesn't specify the use of a known vulnerability or the method of delivering the payload, which are mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions a spear phishing attack to deliver a payload. This payload is then used to exploit a year-old Office vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, to gain access.
   - T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is the technique that best aligns with this sequence, as it involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a publicly accessible application, which in this case is Microsoft Office Equation Editor.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Spear phishing (T1192) to deliver a payload -> Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190) to leverage the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 -> Gain Access.
