 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after TeamTNT compromised the exposed Weave Scope service and led to the deployment and execution of the coin miner payload.
   - The answer choices provided are techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1648-Serverless Execution involves the use of cloud-based services to execute code without the need for traditional servers. This technique is not directly related to deploying and executing a payload on the compromised system.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter involves the use of command-line interpreters to execute commands or scripts. This technique could be used to deploy and execute a payload, but it doesn't necessarily follow the initial access through the Weave Scope service.
   - T1055.009-Proc Memory involves the use of process injection techniques to execute code in the memory of a running process. This technique could be used to deploy and execute a payload without creating a new process, which might be more stealthy.
   - T1595-Active Scanning involves the use of active probes to discover hosts and services on a network. This technique is not directly related to deploying and executing a payload on a compromised system.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After compromising the Weave Scope service, TeamTNT would likely gain access to the compromised system. To deploy and execute a payload, they would need to use a technique that allows them to run the payload on the compromised system without creating a new process or being detected easily.
   - T1055.009-Proc Memory fits this description as it allows for the execution of code in the memory of a running process, making it less detectable.

Final Answer: T1055.009-Proc Memory.
