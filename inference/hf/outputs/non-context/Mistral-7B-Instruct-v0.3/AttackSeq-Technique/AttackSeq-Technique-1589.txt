 Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe is performed, and the payload is initiated.
   - The question then asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely ensured T9000's components would run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion is not related to persistence or autostarting of processes.
   - B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities is not directly related to ensuring components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.
   - C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is about establishing persistence by configuring a system to run a specific process during the boot or logon process, which aligns with the question's requirements.
   - D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process is about creating or modifying existing system processes, but it does not necessarily ensure that the process will run with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - DLL sideloading with igfxtray.exe and initiating its payload sets up the initial execution of T9000's components.
   - To ensure these components run or load with every user mode process spawned following system reboot, the attacker would need to establish persistence, which is what T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is about.
   - By configuring the system to run T9000's components during the boot or logon process, the attacker ensures that the components will be loaded with every user mode process spawned following system reboot.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - T1027.001 - DLL Sideloading (to initiate the payload)
   - T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (to ensure the components run with every user mode process spawned following system reboot)
