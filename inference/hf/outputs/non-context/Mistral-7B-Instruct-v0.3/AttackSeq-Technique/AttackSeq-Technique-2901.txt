 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the 'yty' framework communicated with its C2 server.
   - The communication involved downloading a file from Google Docs and sending beacon messages.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1102-Web Service: This technique involves the use of web services to communicate, but it doesn't necessarily imply the downloading of a file or setting up a C2 communication.
   - T1665-Hide Infrastructure: This technique is about hiding infrastructure to evade detection, which doesn't directly relate to the downloading of a file or C2 communication.
   - T1213-Data from Information Repositories: This technique involves gathering data from information repositories, but it doesn't directly relate to the downloading of a file from Google Docs or C2 communication.
   - T1216-System Script Proxy Execution: This technique involves using a system script to proxy execution, which could potentially be used to download a file (if the script is designed to do so) and then communicate with the C2 server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question involves downloading a file (implying some form of data transfer) and then communicating with a C2 server.
   - T1216-System Script Proxy Execution could potentially be used to download a file (if the script is designed to do so), making it a plausible choice for the initial step in the sequence.
   - After downloading the file, the script could then be used to communicate with the C2 server, which aligns with the subsequent step of sending beacon messages.

Final Answer: T1216-System Script Proxy Execution.
