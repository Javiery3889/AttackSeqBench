 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:
1. The question mentions the deployment of a custom VBS backdoor and execution of VBS scripts for potential data collection. This suggests that the initial access (T1071) has been achieved, and the attacker is now looking to establish communication with their servers.
2. T1071-Application Layer Protocol refers to the use of application-layer protocols for command and control (C2) communication. Since the question mentions the download of additional payloads, it implies that the attacker needs a way to communicate with their servers to receive these payloads.
3. T1571-Non-Standard Port is not a direct method for downloading additional payloads but rather a technique used to bypass network security by using non-standard ports.
4. T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job and T1053-Scheduled Task/Job are techniques used for persistence and automation of tasks, not for downloading additional payloads.
5. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be T1071 (Initial Access) followed by T1071-Application Layer Protocol (Command and Control) to download additional payloads.
