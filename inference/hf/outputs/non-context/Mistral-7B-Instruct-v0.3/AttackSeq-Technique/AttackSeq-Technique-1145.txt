 Final Answer: T1102-Web Service

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GroundPeony used spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs to deliver malicious payloads. After this, they evaded defense mechanisms using DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1218.004-InstallUtil is a technique for executing scripts or installing applications, but it doesn't necessarily follow the sequence described in the question.
   - T1053.002-At is a technique for account manipulation, which doesn't seem to be a logical step after delivering malicious payloads and before evading defense mechanisms.
   - T1102-Web Service is a technique for command and control, which could be used to download and execute the malicious payload delivered via spear-phishing emails. This would logically precede the evasion techniques mentioned.
   - T1129-Shared Modules is a technique for using libraries, frameworks, or binaries downloaded from remote servers to execute malicious code. However, it doesn't seem to be a logical step after the delivery of the malicious payload and before the evasion techniques.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that GroundPeony first delivered a malicious payload via spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs (T1192.002). After this, they likely used a web service (T1102) to download and execute the malicious payload. Finally, they evaded defense mechanisms using DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations (T1565.003 and T1071.001). Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1192.002 -> T1102 -> T1565.003 and T1071.001. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the initial delivery of the malicious payload and before the evasion techniques. Based on this, the answer is T1102-Web Service.
