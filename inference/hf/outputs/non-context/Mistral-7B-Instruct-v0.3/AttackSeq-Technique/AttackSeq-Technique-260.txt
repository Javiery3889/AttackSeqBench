 Final Answer: T1133-External Remote Services

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the initial access phase to compromise external remote services.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes abusing Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging involves replacing a legitimate process with a malicious one, which doesn't directly relate to the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.
   - T1078.001-Default Accounts refers to the exploitation of default or weak credentials, but there's no mention of this in the question.
   - T1620-Reflective Code Loading involves loading code from an external source, which could be used in later stages of an attack, but it doesn't directly relate to the initial access phase or the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.
   - T1133-External Remote Services involves exploiting remote services to gain access, which aligns well with the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to access external services.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions abusing Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling. This technique is often used to establish a connection to a target system, which falls under the Initial Access phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Reverse SSH tunneling is a method of creating a secure connection from a target system back to the attacker's system. This is typically done to bypass firewalls and other security measures.
   - In this case, the attacker is using Cloud Shell (a service provided by a cloud provider) to establish the reverse SSH tunnel. This implies that the attacker is exploiting an external remote service (the cloud provider's service) to gain initial access.
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that occurred during the initial access phase to compromise external remote services is T1133-External Remote Services.
