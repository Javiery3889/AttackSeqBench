 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question. The sequence is as follows:

1. Maintaining persistence (T1003) - Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory.
2. Collecting information about installed security products and banking protection software (T1087) - Grandoreiro gathers information about the security software installed on the system.

The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the collection of information. In this case, it's reasonable to assume that an attacker would first discover the software they are trying to evade or bypass before attempting to collect information about it. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before T1087 (collection of information) is T1518 - Software Discovery.

Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery.
