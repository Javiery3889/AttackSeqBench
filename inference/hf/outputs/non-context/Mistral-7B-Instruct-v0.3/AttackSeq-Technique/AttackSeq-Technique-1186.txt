 Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after a backdoor function gathered machine information during the Discovery phase, with the goal of further extracting visual data from the victim's system.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1113-Screen Capture is the technique that involves capturing images or videos from a victim's screen, which aligns with the goal of extracting visual data.
   - T1588.006-Vulnerabilities is about exploiting known software vulnerabilities, which does not directly relate to extracting visual data.
   - T1102-Web Service is about creating, modifying, or deleting web services, which is not directly related to extracting visual data.
   - T1213.001-Confluence is a specific technique for Atlassian Confluence servers, and it does not directly relate to extracting visual data from a victim's system.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The backdoor function has already gathered machine information during the Discovery phase.
   - To further extract visual data, the attacker would need a technique that can capture images or videos from the victim's screen.
   - T1113-Screen Capture is the technique that best fits this scenario, as it allows an attacker to capture visual data from a victim's system.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Discovery (T1087) -> Initial Access (T1078) -> Command and Control (T1055) -> Backdoor (T1056) -> T1113-Screen Capture.
