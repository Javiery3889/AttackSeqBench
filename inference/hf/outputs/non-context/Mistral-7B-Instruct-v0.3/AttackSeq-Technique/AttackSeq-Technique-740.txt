 Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers collected detailed target information, prepared phishing attacks, but have not yet intercepted multi-factor authentication codes.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception would likely occur after the attackers have gained access to the multi-factor authentication codes, so it is not the most plausible sequence.
   - T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - T1555.001-Keychain is a technique used to steal credentials, which is not the next logical step after collecting detailed target information and preparing phishing attacks.
   - T1564-Hide Artifacts is a technique used to evade detection after initial reconnaissance and before further actions like intercepting multi-factor authentication codes. This technique aligns best with the sequence of events described in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After the attackers have collected detailed target information (T1087), they would prepare highly tailored phishing attacks (T1192).
   - To avoid detection during this phishing campaign, they may use T1564-Hide Artifacts to remove or alter traces of their activities on the target system.
   - Only after successfully executing the phishing attacks and gaining access to the multi-factor authentication codes would they perform T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1087, T1192, T1564, T1111.
