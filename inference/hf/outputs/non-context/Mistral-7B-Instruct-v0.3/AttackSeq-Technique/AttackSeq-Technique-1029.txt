 Final Answer: C: T1119-Automated Collection

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes that Gamaredon used its backdoor to list interesting files on the system during the discovery phase. The question then asks for the technique that most likely occurred to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1596.002-WHOIS is a technique used to gather information about a domain, IP address, or URL. It does not involve gathering sensitive documents from the local system, drives, or network shares.
   - T1553-Subvert Trust Controls is a technique used to bypass security controls by manipulating trust relationships. It does not directly involve gathering sensitive documents.
   - T1119-Automated Collection is a technique used to gather data from a system using automated means, such as scripts, bots, or other tools. This technique aligns best with the action of gathering sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares after the discovery phase.
   - T1213.001-Confluence is a technique used to gather data from a specific application, in this case, Confluence. While it could potentially be used to gather sensitive documents, it is not the most likely technique given the context of the question, which focuses on the local system, drives, and network shares.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After discovering interesting files on the system, Gamaredon would likely want to gather sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares to further its objectives.
   - T1119-Automated Collection is a technique that involves using automated means to gather data, which could include scripts or tools to search for and collect sensitive documents from the specified locations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Discovery (T1087) -> Initial Access (T1078) -> Command and Control (T1055) -> T1119-Automated Collection.
