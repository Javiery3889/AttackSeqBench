 To answer this question, we need to understand the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question. The question states that a PowerShell script containing a decoy document was executed, and then GOLDBACKDOOR utilized Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs for exfiltration and receiving commands.

The question does not provide any information about the use of valid accounts, native APIs, or phishing before the execution of the PowerShell script. However, the use of a decoy document suggests that some form of social engineering or deception was used to trick the user into executing the script. This is most closely aligned with T1566 - Phishing.

So, the sequence of TTPs could be:
1. T1566 - Phishing (to trick the user into executing the PowerShell script)
2. T1086 - PowerShell (to execute the PowerShell script containing a decoy document)
3. GOLDBACKDOOR (using Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs for exfiltration and receiving commands)

Final Answer: T1566 - Phishing.
