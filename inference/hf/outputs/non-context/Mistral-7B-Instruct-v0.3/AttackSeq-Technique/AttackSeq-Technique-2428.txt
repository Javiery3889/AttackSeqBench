 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers first leveraged the bank's connectivity for reconnaissance, then used credentials to navigate laterally into the processor's network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching, T1072-Software Deployment Tools, and T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material do not directly involve leveraging connectivity for reconnaissance or navigating laterally with credentials.
   - T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material could potentially be used to gain access to the processor's network, but it is not mentioned as the initial step in the question.
   - However, T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material could be used after gaining initial access to the network (e.g., using stolen or compromised credentials) to maintain access even if the original credentials are revoked or detected.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence where the attackers first perform reconnaissance using the bank's connectivity, then use credentials to navigate laterally.
   - Since T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material is not directly related to reconnaissance or initial access, it is less likely to have occurred before the attackers used credentials to navigate laterally.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that another technique occurred before T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material. However, the question does not provide enough information to definitively determine the exact technique used for the initial access.
   - Final Answer: It is not possible to definitively determine the exact technique that occurred before T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material based on the information provided in the question.
