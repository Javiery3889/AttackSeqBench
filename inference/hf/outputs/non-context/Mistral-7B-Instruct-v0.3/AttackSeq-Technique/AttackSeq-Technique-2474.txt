 Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that enabled the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes the use of legitimate tools, scripting, and the exfiltration of stolen credentials.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores does not involve the use of legitimate tools or scripts to remain undetected.
   - B: T1036-Masquerading involves the use of legitimate credentials to perform actions, which aligns with the use of legitimate tools and scripts mentioned in the question.
   - C: T1053.002-At does not directly involve the use of legitimate tools or scripts to remain undetected.
   - D: T1078-Valid Accounts does not involve the use of legitimate tools or scripts to remain undetected.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the use of legitimate tools and scripts. Technique T1036-Masquerading involves using legitimate credentials to perform actions, which can be achieved through the use of legitimate tools and scripts.
   - This technique allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user, which can help the attack remain undetected by behavior-based detectors as the actions performed will appear as if they were carried out by a legitimate user.
   - The other techniques do not directly involve the use of legitimate tools or scripts to remain undetected, making them less plausible in this context.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - T1036-Masquerading (to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts)
   - T1105-Exfiltration (to exfiltrate stolen credentials)
   - T1077-Network Service Execution (to use an FTP server to exfiltrate the data)
