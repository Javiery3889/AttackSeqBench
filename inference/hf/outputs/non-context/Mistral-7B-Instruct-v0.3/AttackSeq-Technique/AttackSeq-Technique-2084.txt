 Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where RIG EK fetches malware from the C&C infrastructure using an obfuscated PowerShell script during execution. The malware is encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel is a technique used to securely transmit data, which aligns with the encrypted malware transmission described in the question.
   - T1205-Traffic Signaling is used to establish, maintain, or terminate a connection, but it doesn't necessarily imply the use of an encrypted channel.
   - T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking is a technique used to redirect system calls to a malicious library, not related to encrypted data transmission.
   - T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy is a technique used to route traffic through multiple proxies to evade detection, but it doesn't imply the use of an encrypted channel or the transmission of encrypted data.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that the malware is encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm. This implies that the data being transmitted (the malware) is encrypted, which aligns with the definition of T1573-Encrypted Channel.
   - The question also mentions that the malware is fetched from the C&C infrastructure, which suggests a Command and Control tactic. T1573 is a technique under the Command and Control tactic.
   - Therefore, T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred as part of the Command and Control tactic to securely transmit exploit code encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.
