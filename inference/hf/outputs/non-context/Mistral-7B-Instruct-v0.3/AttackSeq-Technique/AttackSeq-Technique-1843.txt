 To answer this question, we need to consider the ATT&CK techniques and their typical sequence in a cyber attack.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C servers.
   - The communication with C&C servers is typically used for coordinating malicious activities, so we can assume that the attacker has already gained initial access and established a foothold in the system.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1496.001 - Compute Hijacking: This technique involves taking control of a running process on a target system. It's not necessarily related to communication with C&C servers, so it's less likely to occur after the communication.
   - T1001 - Data Obfuscation: This technique involves making data unreadable or difficult to interpret. It's not directly related to the communication with C&C servers, and it's not a common final step in many attacks.
   - T1485 - Data Destruction: This technique involves destroying or modifying data on a target system. It could be a possible step after communication with C&C servers, but it's not the most common sequence.
   - T1657 - Financial Theft: This technique involves stealing financial data from a target system. It's less likely to occur after communication with C&C servers, as financial theft is usually an early or ongoing step in a cyber attack, not a late one.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The most plausible sequence would be: Communication with C&C servers (for coordinating malicious activities) -> Data Destruction (to cover tracks or disrupt operations).
   - Final Answer: C: T1485 - Data Destruction.
