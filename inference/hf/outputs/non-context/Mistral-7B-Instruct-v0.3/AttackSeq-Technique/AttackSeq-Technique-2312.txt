 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that the adversary used discovery commands to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log (T1086.001) and is looking for the next step before exfiltrating data.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture typically involves using a web browser to access a malicious website or web portal. This doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - B: T1005-Data from Local System is about exfiltrating data, which is the next step after the adversary has gathered the data (in this case, from the Security Event Log), but it's not the step that occurs before exfiltration.
   - C: T1218.014-MMC (Microsoft Management Console) is about creating, modifying, or using a legitimate Windows tool for malicious purposes. This could be a plausible step after discovering information (T1086.001) and before exfiltration, as the adversary might use MMC to manage and manipulate the data before sending it out.
   - D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is about exfiltrating data, which is the next step after the adversary has gathered the data and possibly processed it (as suggested by T1218.014-MMC). However, it's not the step that occurs before exfiltration in this sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Final Answer: C: T1218.014-MMC. This answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence in the question. The adversary first used discovery commands to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log (T1086.001), then possibly used MMC to manage and manipulate the data (T1218.014-MMC), and finally exfiltrated the data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.
