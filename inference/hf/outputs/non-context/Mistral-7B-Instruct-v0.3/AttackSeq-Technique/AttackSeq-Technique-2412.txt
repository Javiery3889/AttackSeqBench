 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the execution of a second-stage downloader via a malicious macro. The question then asks about the technique that most likely occurred before Lokibot used a 'fileless' UAC bypass technique.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1659-Content Injection and T1586.001-Social Media Accounts do not seem to be directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - T1566-Phishing could be a possible answer as it often involves the use of malicious macros in emails to download malware. However, it doesn't explicitly state that the phishing occurred before the UAC bypass.
   - T1055-Process Injection is a technique that involves injecting code into a legitimate process, which could be used to download and execute the second-stage downloader. This technique could potentially be used before the UAC bypass.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with the execution of a second-stage downloader, which suggests that a download process occurred before.
   - T1055-Process Injection is a technique that can be used to download and execute malware, making it a plausible choice for the initial download of the second-stage downloader.
   - After the second-stage downloader is executed, Lokibot uses a 'fileless' UAC bypass technique to escalate privileges. This suggests that Lokibot is already present in the system and is looking for a way to escalate privileges.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that T1055-Process Injection occurred before T1087-Windows Admin Shield Bypass (the 'fileless' UAC bypass technique used by Lokibot).

Final Answer: T1055-Process Injection.
