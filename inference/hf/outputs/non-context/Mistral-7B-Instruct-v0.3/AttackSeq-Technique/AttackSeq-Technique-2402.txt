 Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the victim is enticed to interact with a malicious link leading to trojanized files. The attacker then uses a script named 'DeleteLeftovers' to remove attack artifacts.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter involves the use of scripts or command-line interpreters to execute commands with the intent of maintaining persistence, installing malware, or executing other malicious activities. In this case, the script 'DeleteLeftovers' is mentioned, which suggests the use of a command and scripting interpreter.
   - T1585-Establish Accounts is about creating, modifying, or using accounts to access resources. This technique does not seem to be directly related to the removal of attack artifacts.
   - T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is about transferring data covertly from the compromised host to the attacker's C2 server. This technique does not involve the removal of attack artifacts.
   - T1059.003-Windows Command Shell is a specific type of T1059 that uses the Windows Command Shell to execute commands. Since the script 'DeleteLeftovers' is mentioned, it implies that a scripting language is used, which is not necessarily limited to the Windows Command Shell. Therefore, T1059.003 is not the best fit for this sequence of TTPs.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The victim is enticed to interact with a malicious link (T1101-Phishing).
   - The interaction leads to the download of trojanized files (T1105-Spearphishing Attachment).
   - The trojanized files are executed, potentially installing malware (T1055-PowerShell).
   - The malware then runs the 'DeleteLeftovers' script to remove attack artifacts (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1101, T1105, T1055, and A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
