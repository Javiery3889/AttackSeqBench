 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to Agrius ensuring command execution and minimizing detection after achieving persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - The answer choices provided are T1021-Remote Services, T1070-Indicator Removal, T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection, and T1202-Indirect Command Execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1021-Remote Services involves the use of legitimate remote services to execute commands on the target system. While this technique could be used for command execution, it doesn't seem to be directly related to the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor or minimizing detection.
   - T1070-Indicator Removal is about removing or modifying indicators of compromise to evade detection. This technique doesn't seem to be directly related to command execution or the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection involves injecting code into the memory of a running process. This technique could potentially be used for command execution, but it doesn't seem to be directly related to minimizing detection or the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - T1202-Indirect Command Execution involves executing commands indirectly, often through the use of a script or a legitimate application. This technique could be used to execute commands without raising suspicion, which aligns with the goal of minimizing detection. Additionally, it doesn't explicitly require the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, but it could be used after achieving persistence with the backdoor to execute commands.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs could be as follows:
     - T1080 (Initial Access) - Agrius gains access to the target system.
     - T1055 (Command and Control) - Agrius establishes a command and control channel, possibly using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for persistence.
     - T1075 (Persistence) - Agrius ensures persistence on the target system by deploying the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
     - T1202 (Indirect Command Execution) - Agrius executes commands indirectly to minimize detection.
   - Final Answer: T1202-Indirect Command Execution.
