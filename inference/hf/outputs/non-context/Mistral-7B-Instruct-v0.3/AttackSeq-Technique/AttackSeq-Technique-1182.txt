 Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor collects machine information and screenshots to send data to the C&C server.
   - After this, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurs to enable communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is about exploiting software on internet-facing systems, which doesn't directly relate to enabling communication after data collection.
   - B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive is about exfiltrating data from a network share, but it doesn't involve querying external services or transmitting encrypted messages.
   - C: T1102-Web Service is about using web services for command and control, which aligns with the requirement of querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.
   - D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is about transferring tools into the target environment, which doesn't directly relate to enabling communication after data collection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After the backdoor collects machine information and screenshots, it needs to send this data to the C&C server.
   - To do this, it needs to communicate with the C&C server, which is an external service.
   - The data transmission should be encrypted to avoid detection.
   - Using a web service (T1102) is a common technique for command and control, and it allows for encrypted communication with the C&C server, making it the most plausible answer.
