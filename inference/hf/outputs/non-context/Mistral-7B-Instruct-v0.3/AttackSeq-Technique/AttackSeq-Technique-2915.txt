 Final Answer: D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz (T1086), then stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1078-Valid Accounts involves using valid accounts, but it doesn't necessarily imply that the attacker would steal a VPN certificate beforehand.
   - B: T1003.007-Proc Filesystem manipulation is not directly related to stealing a VPN certificate.
   - C: T1600-Weaken Encryption is about intentionally weakening encryption, which doesn't help the attacker obtain a VPN certificate.
   - D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates is the most plausible answer as it involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which would allow the attacker to gain access to the VPN network.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker first gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz (T1086).
   - To gain remote network access, the attacker would need a VPN certificate.
   - The most logical step before stealing the VPN certificate would be to steal or forge authentication certificates (T1649), as this would provide the necessary credentials to access the VPN network.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1086 (Gain Domain Admin Credentials) -> T1649 (Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates) -> Access VPN Network.
