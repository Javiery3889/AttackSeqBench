 Final Answer: C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitates the transfer of sensitive information collected by CosmicDuke to remote servers. The TTPs mentioned in the question are data collection methods used by CosmicDuke (keyloggers, screenshotters, clipboard stealers).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1025-Data from Removable Media does not seem plausible because CosmicDuke is known to exfiltrate data directly, not through removable media.
   - B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a technique that involves the automated transfer of data from an compromised system to a remote server, which aligns with the data collection methods used by CosmicDuke.
   - D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service could be a possibility, but it is less specific than T1020 as it includes any method of exfiltration over the web. However, since T1020 is more specific to the automated transfer of data, it is a more plausible answer.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After CosmicDuke collects sensitive information using tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers, it needs a method to transfer this information to remote servers.
   - T1025-Data from Removable Media does not fit because CosmicDuke does not use removable media for data transfer.
   - T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service could be a possibility, but it is less specific than T1020 as it includes any method of exfiltration over the web.
   - T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a technique that involves the automated transfer of data from an compromised system to a remote server, which aligns with the data collection methods used by CosmicDuke and is more specific than T1567. Therefore, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most plausible answer.
