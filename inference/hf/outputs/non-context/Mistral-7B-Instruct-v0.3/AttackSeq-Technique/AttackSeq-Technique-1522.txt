 Final Answer: B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred prior to the attackers appending the obfuscated code to the compromised CDN's Javascript file.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are obfuscation of malicious code, defense evasion, and appending the obfuscated code to a Javascript file.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1659-Content Injection involves injecting, modifying, or deleting data into storage, which does not necessarily involve obfuscating malicious code or compromising a CDN's Javascript file.
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise involves exploiting a vulnerability in a software application to deliver malware, which can lead to the compromise of a CDN's Javascript file and the subsequent obfuscation of malicious code.
   - T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain is about compromising hardware during the manufacturing process, which is not related to the obfuscation of malicious code or the compromise of a CDN's Javascript file.
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is about making files or information difficult to understand for unauthorized users, which is the final step in the sequence described in the question, not the initial step.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers first compromised a software application (T1189-Drive-by Compromise), which led to the compromise of the CDN's Javascript file.
   - After compromising the Javascript file, they obfuscated their malicious code (T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information) to evade detection.
   - Finally, they appended the obfuscated code to the compromised CDN's Javascript file.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1189-Drive-by Compromise -> T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information -> Appending the obfuscated code to the compromised CDN's Javascript file. However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred prior to the appending of the obfuscated code, so the final answer is T1189-Drive-by Compromise.
