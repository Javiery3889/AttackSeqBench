 Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - ZeroT retrieves stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs employing steganography.
   - ZeroT transmitted system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1071.003-Mail Protocols does not involve HTTP POST beacons or RC4 encryption.
   - T1556.007-Hybrid Identity does not involve the transmission of system information or RC4 encryption.
   - T1566-Phishing does not involve the transmission of system information using HTTP POST beacons or RC4 encryption.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel involves the use of encrypted channels, which aligns with the use of RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - ZeroT retrieves stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs employing steganography (T1086). This is a method to hide data within other data, such as an image file.
   - After obtaining the stage-2 payloads, ZeroT transmits system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons. This transmission is an encrypted channel (T1573), as it involves the use of encryption (RC4) and the HTTP POST method for data transmission.
   - The other answer choices do not align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. T1071.003 is about using mail protocols, T1556.007 is about using hybrid identities, and T1566 is about phishing techniques.
