 Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the deployment of a downloader (T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer), decryption of the payload using the DES algorithm (T1110-Data Encryption), and the establishment of communication for further payload transfer dependent on the victim's OS architecture.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1204-User Execution is about executing files or scripts as a legitimate user, but it doesn't directly relate to establishing communication for further payload transfer.
   - T1132-Data Encoding is about encoding data for obfuscation or evasion, but it doesn't involve establishing communication.
   - T1185-Browser Session Hijacking is about taking over an existing network session, which doesn't seem to be related to the given sequence of TTPs.
   - T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is about transferring tools or malware into the target environment, which aligns well with the deployment of the downloader mentioned in the question. After deploying the downloader, it's likely that the attacker would transfer additional tools or payloads, which would require communication, making T1105 the most plausible answer.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the deployment of a downloader (T1105) and its decryption (T1110). After decrypting the payload, the attacker would need to transfer additional payloads or tools to execute their attack based on the victim's OS architecture. This process would involve establishing communication, which is not explicitly mentioned in the other answer choices. Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred to establish communication for further payload transfer is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
