 Final Answer: T1086-PowerShell

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the use of systeminfo.exe and net.exe for system and network discovery, and wmic.exe for lateral movement to the Domain Controller.
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1057-Process Discovery involves the collection of information about running processes on a system, which is not directly related to the information provided in the question.
   - T1087.004-Cloud Account is about the exploitation of cloud services, which is not a likely step after system and network discovery and before lateral movement.
   - T1069-Permission Groups Discovery involves the collection of information about user and system permissions, which is not directly related to the information provided in the question.
   - T1086-PowerShell is about the use of PowerShell for command and scripting, which could be used to execute commands like wmic.exe for lateral movement after gathering system and network information with systeminfo.exe and net.exe.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The actors first gathered system and network information using systeminfo.exe and net.exe in the Discovery phase.
   - After gathering this information, they could use PowerShell (T1086) to execute commands like wmic.exe for lateral movement to the Domain Controller, which is the step that most likely occurred next in the attack sequence.
   - Therefore, the final answer is T1086-PowerShell.
