 Final Answer: C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the TTP that most likely occurred during the Reconnaissance phase before the Initial Access via phishing emails.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1137.001-Office Template Macros and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel are techniques that are more related to Initial Access and Command & Control respectively, and do not typically occur during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning is a technique used to brute force login credentials, which is more related to the Initial Access phase rather than the Reconnaissance phase.
   - T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information is a technique used to collect information about potential victims during the Reconnaissance phase, making it the most likely choice before the Initial Access via phishing emails. This information can be used to craft more convincing phishing emails.
