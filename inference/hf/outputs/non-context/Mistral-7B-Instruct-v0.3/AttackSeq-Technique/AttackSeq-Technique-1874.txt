 Final Answer: A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the malware's communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+. The malware used legitimate third-party online services to evade detection upon being loaded onto victim machines.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1552.001-Credentials In Files: This technique involves storing credentials in files, which can be used to access various online services, including Pastebin or Google+. This technique allows the malware to communicate with C2 servers by logging into these services using the stored credentials.
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information: This technique involves making files or information unreadable to humans or automated tools without the use of a decryption key. This technique does not directly facilitate communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+.
   - T1001.002-Steganography: This technique involves concealing data within other data, such as hiding malicious code within an image or document. This technique does not directly facilitate communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+.
   - T1102-Web Service: This technique involves using legitimate web services for malicious purposes. However, this technique does not specify the use of credentials stored in files, which is necessary for accessing Pastebin or Google+.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware used legitimate third-party online services to evade detection upon being loaded onto victim machines.
   - T1552.001-Credentials In Files involves storing credentials in files, which can be used to access various online services.
   - Since the malware needs to access Pastebin or Google+ to communicate with C2 servers, it is likely that the malware used T1552.001-Credentials In Files to store the necessary credentials for accessing these services.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - T1552.001-Credentials In Files (storing credentials for accessing Pastebin or Google+)
   - T1078-Web Browse (using the stored credentials to access Pastebin or Google+)
   - T1055.003-Command and Control (using the accessed Pastebin or Google+ to communicate with C2 servers)
