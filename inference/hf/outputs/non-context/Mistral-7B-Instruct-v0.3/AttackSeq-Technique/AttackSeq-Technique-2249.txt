 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that SideCopy used malicious LNK files as part of their infection chain and then deployed various RATs and plugins including file enumerators and credential-stealers.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the initial infection and before the deployment of RATs and plugins.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1195-Supply Chain Compromise is about compromising legitimate supply chain channels to deliver malware. This technique is more related to the initial infection, not the subsequent steps.
   - T1036-Masquerading involves disguising malicious files as legitimate files. This technique could be used to hide the malicious LNK files, but it doesn't necessarily have to occur after the initial infection.
   - T1205-Traffic Signaling is about sending covert communications from compromised hosts to command and control servers. This technique is more likely to occur after the initial infection and RAT deployment, but it doesn't directly involve the deployment of plugins like file enumerators and credential-stealers.
   - T1566-Phishing is about delivering phishing content to victims. This technique could be used to trick users into opening the malicious LNK files, making it a possible step before the initial infection. However, it's more likely that T1566 would be used to deliver the initial phishing email, not the RATs and plugins.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the initial infection and before the deployment of RATs and plugins.
   - T1205-Traffic Signaling is a plausible technique that could occur after the initial infection, but it doesn't directly involve the deployment of plugins like file enumerators and credential-stealers.
   - T1036-Masquerading could occur before or after the initial infection, and it doesn't directly involve the deployment of RATs and plugins.
   - T1195-Supply Chain Compromise is more related to the initial infection, not the subsequent steps.
   - T1566-Phishing is less likely to occur after the initial infection and RAT deployment, as it's more associated with delivering the initial phishing email.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario would be: Initial Infection (T1195 or other techniques) -> Deployment of Malicious LNK files -> T1036-Masquerading (optional) -> Deployment of RATs and plugins (T1086, T1055, etc.). However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the deployment of RATs and plugins, so T1205-Traffic Signaling is the best answer.

Final Answer: T1205-Traffic Signaling.
