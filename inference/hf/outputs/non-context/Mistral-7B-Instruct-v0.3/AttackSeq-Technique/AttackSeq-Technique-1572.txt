 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Turla used PowerShell to run malware directly in memory for execution and before encrypting payloads to evade detection.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1546-Event Triggered Execution involves executing a file or command in response to an event, such as a system startup or user action. This doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence mentioned in the question.
   - B: T1578-Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure is about modifying cloud compute resources for an attacker's benefit, which doesn't seem to be a logical step after running malware in memory and before encrypting payloads.
   - C: T1137-Office Application Startup involves executing a file or command when an Office application starts. This could be a possible step after running malware in memory, but it doesn't necessarily have to be before encrypting payloads.
   - D: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery involves discovering and enumerating peripheral devices connected to a system. This doesn't seem to be a logical step after running malware in memory and before encrypting payloads.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence in the question suggests a progression from running malware in memory, to performing some action, and then encrypting payloads.
   - T1137-Office Application Startup could be a possible step after running malware in memory, but it doesn't necessarily have to be before encrypting payloads. On the other hand, T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery doesn't seem to be a logical step in this sequence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer would be a technique that could be performed after running malware in memory and before encrypting payloads. One such technique could be T1055-PowerShell, which involves using PowerShell to execute commands or scripts. However, since the question specifies that PowerShell was already used to run malware, T1055 can't be the answer.
   - The remaining answer choice is T1086-PowerShell Empire, which is a PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework that can perform various actions, including encrypting payloads (T1027-Data Obfuscation). Therefore, T1086-PowerShell Empire seems to be the most plausible answer.

Final Answer: T1086-PowerShell Empire.
