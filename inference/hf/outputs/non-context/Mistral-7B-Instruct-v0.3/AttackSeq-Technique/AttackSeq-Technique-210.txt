 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FamousSparrow exfiltrated data after SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: This technique involves sending stolen data back to the command and control server. Since the question mentions that FamousSparrow used a different method for communication (HTTPS), this answer seems less likely. However, it doesn't exclude the possibility that this technique was used after the initial communication.
   - B: T1055-Process Injection: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process. There's no indication in the question that this was used for data exfiltration.
   - C: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery: This technique involves discovering security software on a target system. There's no indication in the question that this was used for data exfiltration.
   - D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: Since the question mentions that FamousSparrow exfiltrated data, and the initial communication was through a secure channel (HTTPS), it's plausible that the data was sent back to the C&C server, which aligns with T1041.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS, a secure protocol.
   - Step 2: SparrowDoor used encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys.
   - Step 3: FamousSparrow exfiltrated data.
   - Final Answer: Given the sequence of events, it's most likely that FamousSparrow exfiltrated data using T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, as this technique involves sending stolen data back to the command and control server, which aligns with the secure communication method (HTTPS) and the use of encryption (multi-byte XOR keys) mentioned in the question.
