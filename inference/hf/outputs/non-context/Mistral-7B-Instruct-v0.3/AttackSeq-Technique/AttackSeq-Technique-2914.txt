 Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before APT15 deployed backdoors such as RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution, given that they gained domain administrator credentials through Mimikatz.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow refers to the technique of Modifying System Execution, which is not related to credential dumping or initial access.
   - B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories is a technique used to gather data from various sources, but it does not directly relate to the initial access or credential dumping.
   - D: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads is a technique used to execute code or a malicious payload that was previously placed on the system, which is more likely to occur after initial access and credential dumping.
   - C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping is the technique of extracting credentials from the operating system, which is the most likely technique to occur before deploying backdoors, as it allows the attacker to maintain persistence on the system using the stolen credentials.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After gaining domain administrator credentials through Mimikatz, the attacker would need to use those credentials to move laterally within the network or escalate privileges.
   - To maintain persistence on the system, APT15 deploys backdoors such as RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.
   - However, before deploying these backdoors, the attacker would need to ensure they have the necessary credentials to execute these backdoors, which is why T1003-OS Credential Dumping is the most likely technique to have occurred before the deployment of the backdoors.
