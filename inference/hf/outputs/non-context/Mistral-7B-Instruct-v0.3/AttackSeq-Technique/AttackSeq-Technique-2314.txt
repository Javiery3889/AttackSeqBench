 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary copied results from the discovery phase and before exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.
   - The discovery phase activities mentioned are file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1114-Email Collection is about collecting email addresses and sending emails, which doesn't seem to be directly related to the activities mentioned in the question.
   - T1080-Taint Shared Content is about modifying shared files to contain malicious content, which doesn't seem to be a necessary step before exfiltration.
   - T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive is about exfiltrating data from network shares, which is a form of data exfiltration, not a technique that would typically occur after the discovery phase.
   - T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is about exploiting a remote service to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This technique doesn't seem to be directly related to the activities mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question mentions that the adversary has already copied results from the discovery phase, including file and directory lists, remote system shares, and mailboxes. This suggests that the adversary has already gathered the necessary information about the target system and doesn't need to perform T1114-Email Collection, T1080-Taint Shared Content, or T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services at this point.
   - The only remaining answer, T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive, is about exfiltrating data from network shares, which is a form of data movement, not data collection. However, since the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the discovery phase and before exfiltration using a custom-built tool, T1039 seems to be the most plausible choice.

Final Answer: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive.
