 Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable secure and encrypted communication for data transmission before the backdoor establishes communication with the C&C server using XML messages and collects system and geolocation information of the infected machine.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1001.001-Junk Data does not relate to establishing secure communication channels.
   - C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is about hiding the true nature of files, not establishing encrypted communication channels.
   - D: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption is a technique for encrypting data, but it does not specify that it occurs before establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - B: T1573-Encrypted Channel is about establishing encrypted communication channels, which aligns with the question's requirement that it occurred before the backdoor establishes communication with the C&C server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - To establish secure communication, an encrypted channel must be set up first. This is what T1573-Encrypted Channel represents.
   - Once the encrypted channel is established, the backdoor can then communicate with the C&C server using XML messages and collect system and geolocation information of the infected machine, as mentioned in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1573-Encrypted Channel (establishing secure communication) followed by the actions described in the question.
