 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker might use before establishing initial access.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the TTP that most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through exploitation of external servers.
   - The answer choices provided are T1596.004-CDNs, T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection, T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, and T1590-Gather Victim Network Information.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1596.004-CDNs is about using content delivery networks for command and control (C2) communication, which typically happens after initial access has been established.
   - T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection is a technique used to bypass security restrictions on executable files, but it doesn't necessarily help in gaining initial access.
   - T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is about transferring tools into the target environment, which could be used after initial access has been established to set up a web shell or other tools for maintaining access.
   - T1590-Gather Victim Network Information is about collecting information about the target network and its assets, which could be done before or after initial access, but it doesn't directly help in gaining initial access.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The most logical sequence would be: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information (to find vulnerabilities), followed by T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer (to transfer the exploit tool), and then T1596.004-CDNs (for C2 communication after initial access is established).
   - However, since the question asks for the TTP that most likely occurred before initial access, the answer should be T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer, as it involves transferring tools that could be used to exploit vulnerabilities and gain initial access.

Final Answer: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
