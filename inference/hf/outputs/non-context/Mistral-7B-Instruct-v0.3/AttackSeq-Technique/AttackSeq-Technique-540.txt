 Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where PIVY establishes persistence, uses DLL sideloading, and modifies malware configuration.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1200-Hardware Additions does not involve any of the mentioned TTPs.
   - B: T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting does not relate to the use of DLL sideloading or modifying malware configuration.
   - C: T1564-Hide Artifacts involves hiding evidence of the malicious activity, which could include modifying malware configuration to avoid detection.
   - D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol is related to the use of legitimate protocols for malicious purposes, but it does not directly relate to hiding artifacts, DLL sideloading, or modifying malware configuration.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - First, PIVY establishes persistence by installing itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder (T1053.001-Windows Registry Run Keys).
   - Then, it uses DLL sideloading to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process (T1546.001-DLL Side-Loading).
   - Finally, to evade detection, it modifies malware configuration to hide its presence and activities (T1564-Hide Artifacts). This technique could include altering system settings, file attributes, or other indicators of compromise.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: T1053.001, T1546.001, T1564.
