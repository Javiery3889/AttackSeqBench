 Final Answer: C: T1113-Screen Capture

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the creation of a scheduled task named 'Microsoft_up' and the malware being placed in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. This indicates that T1053-Scheduled Task/Job and T1086-PowerShell were likely used for persistence. However, the question asks about the technique used when "Machete" took photos from the computer's web camera.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery is not related to capturing photos or videos from a web camera.
   - T1125-Video Capture would be more specific if the question mentioned video capture, but since it only mentions photo capture, T1125 is not the most likely answer.
   - T1113-Screen Capture is the technique that best aligns with capturing images from a computer, and it could be used in conjunction with a web camera if the malware is designed to do so.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - First, the attacker established persistence on the system using T1053-Scheduled Task/Job and T1086-PowerShell.
   - After establishing persistence, the malware "Machete" was placed in the 'appdata/MicroDes/' directory.
   - To take photos from the computer's web camera, the malware likely used T1113-Screen Capture technique, as it is the most appropriate method for capturing images from a computer, including web cameras.
