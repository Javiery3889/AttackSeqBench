 Final Answer: A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GreyEnergy operators used Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials. After that, they redirected requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1021.006-Windows Remote Management involves the use of remote desktop protocols for command and control. This technique can be used to establish a connection to a system without the need for physical access, which aligns with the operators gaining access to the system using Mimikatz and PsExec.
   - T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services involves exploiting known vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system. While this could potentially be used to gain initial access, it doesn't necessarily align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application involves exploiting publicly-facing applications to gain access to a system. This technique doesn't seem to fit the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - T1070.004-File Deletion involves deleting files to cover tracks or disrupt operations. This technique doesn't seem to occur before the redirection of requests through internal C&C proxies.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GreyEnergy operators first used Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials. This suggests that they have already gained access to the system.
   - After gaining access, they used Windows Remote Management (T1021.006) to establish a connection to the system remotely, which aligns with the redirection of requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.
   - The other answer choices do not align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
