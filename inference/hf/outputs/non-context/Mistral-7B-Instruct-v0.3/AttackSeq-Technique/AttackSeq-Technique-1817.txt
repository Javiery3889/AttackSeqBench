 Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that allowed Earth Wendigo to evade detection using indirect script execution through the webmail system's features.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information involves the use of techniques to make files or information unreadable or difficult to analyze, which can help an attacker evade detection while executing malicious scripts within the webmail system's features.
   - T1564-Hide Artifacts is about modifying system settings to hide evidence of an attacker's presence, but it doesn't directly help in evading detection during the initial stages of script execution.
   - T1491-Defacement is about altering web pages or websites, which doesn't seem to be related to the evasion of detection during script execution.
   - T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol is about stealing data using means other than standard protocols, but it doesn't help in evading detection during the initial stages of the attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that Earth Wendigo used indirect script execution through the webmail system's features. This suggests that they used a legitimate function or feature of the webmail system to execute their malicious code.
   - To evade detection during this initial stage, they would need to obfuscate their malicious script, making it difficult for security systems to identify as malicious. This is what T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information provides.
   - After successfully evading detection, they proceeded to steal username and password pairs via intercepted HTTPS POST requests, which is a different stage of the attack and not directly related to the initial evasion technique.
