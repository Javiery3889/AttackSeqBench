 Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker (Volatile Cedar) first conducts vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers (T1133-Vulnerability Scanning).
   - After that, they use an Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components (T1055.003-DLL Side-Loading). However, the question asks for the technique that allowed the attacker to spread further into the target network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services typically involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a service running on a remote system. While this could potentially be used to spread further, it doesn't seem to fit the sequence described in the question, as it doesn't follow the identified TTPs.
   - C: T1480.001-Environmental Keying is about using environmental variables to execute commands or scripts. This technique doesn't seem to be related to spreading further into a network based on the provided sequence.
   - D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media involves copying files to removable media for later use. This doesn't seem to fit the sequence described in the question, as there's no mention of removable media.
   - B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application involves exploiting a vulnerability in a publicly accessible application to gain access to the underlying system. This technique fits well with the sequence described in the question, as it could allow the attacker to gain access to more systems within the network after identifying exploitable web servers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Volatile Cedar conducts vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers (T1133-Vulnerability Scanning).
   - Step 2: They find a vulnerable web server and exploit it to gain access to the underlying system (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).
   - Step 3: Once they have access, they use an Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components (T1055.003-DLL Side-Loading) to further compromise the system.
   - Step 4: By exploiting more public-facing applications on other systems within the network, they can spread further into the network (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network is: T1133 -> T1190 -> T1055.003 -> T1190.
