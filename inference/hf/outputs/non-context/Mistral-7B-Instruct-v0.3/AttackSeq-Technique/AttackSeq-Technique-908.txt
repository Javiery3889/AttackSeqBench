 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Dexphot in an attack. The sequence includes using software bundlers, obfuscated batch scripts, and process hollowing to execute malicious code within legitimate system processes. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before process hollowing.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1564-Hide Artifacts is about modifying system settings to hide the presence of an attacker or the actions they've taken. This technique is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned, so it's less likely to have occurred before process hollowing.
   - T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking is about exploiting a vulnerability in the COM interface to execute code. This technique could potentially be used to evade defenses, but it's not directly related to the use of obfuscated batch scripts or process hollowing, so it's less likely to have occurred before process hollowing.
   - T1106-Native API is about executing code using native system APIs to bypass security controls. This technique could be used to evade defenses and is a common precursor to process hollowing, as it allows the attacker to create a new process and manipulate it.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is about executing commands or scripts on a target system. This technique could be used to execute the obfuscated batch scripts, but it's not directly related to process hollowing, so it's less likely to have occurred before process hollowing.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs suggests that Dexphot first used software bundlers and obfuscated batch scripts to evade defenses. Then, they used process hollowing to execute malicious code within legitimate system processes. The technique that could logically occur before process hollowing is one that allows the attacker to execute code on the target system, which is T1106-Native API.

Final Answer: T1106-Native API.
