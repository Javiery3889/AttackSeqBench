 Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that ensures the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are related to device startup and app activation.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass is a technique used to bypass web security controls, not related to device startup or app activation.
   - C: T1546.014-Emond is a technique used for persistence, not related to device startup or app activation.
   - D: T1125-Video Capture is a technique used for data collection, not related to device startup or app activation.
   - B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is a technique used to start a program at system startup, which aligns best with the question's requirements.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that ensures the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is a technique used to start a program at system startup, which would ensure the app's functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
     - T1086.001 - Initial Access (e.g., the user downloads and installs the app)
     - T1550.003 - Data from External Investigation (e.g., the app collects device information, including GPS location)
     - T1547.001 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (e.g., the app is set to start automatically at device startup)
   - The other answer choices do not align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
