 To answer this question, we need to understand the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question and the answer choices.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions a coin miner being executed on a host, and then TeamTNT's script using iplogger.org to track infected hosts.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1542.004-ROMMONkit is a technique related to remote access to an account, which doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - T1049-System Network Connections Discovery is about gathering information about the network, which could be used to find potential targets for the coin miner. However, it doesn't necessarily have to occur before the execution of the coin miner.
   - T1595-Active Scanning is a technique used to find hosts that are likely vulnerable to exploitation. This could be used to find potential targets for the coin miner, and it could occur before the execution of the coin miner.
   - T1087-Account Discovery is about discovering, enumerating, or brute-forcing valid accounts on a system. This doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that the coin miner was executed on a host, and then TeamTNT's script used iplogger.org to track infected hosts.
   - To find potential targets for the coin miner, it would make sense to perform an active scan (T1595) to identify vulnerable hosts.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: T1595 (Active Scanning) before the execution of the coin miner, followed by the execution of the coin miner, and then T1049 (System Network Connections Discovery) to track the infected hosts using iplogger.org.

Final Answer: T1595-Active Scanning.
