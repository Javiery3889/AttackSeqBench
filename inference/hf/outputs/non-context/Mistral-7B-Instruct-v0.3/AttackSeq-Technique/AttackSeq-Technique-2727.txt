 Final Answer: B: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that the Lazarus group conducted discovery activities such as network share and process discovery. This indicates that they have gained initial access and are performing reconnaissance.
   - The question then asks for the technique that occurred before they used compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation. This suggests that the technique in question is a lateral movement technique, as it would allow the attackers to move laterally within the network before they perform the network segmentation bypass.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management is a remote access technique, not a lateral movement technique. It would not typically be used after discovery activities and before bypassing network segmentation.
   - B: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer is a lateral movement technique, which would allow the attackers to move from the initial compromise point to other systems within the network. This aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - C: T1587.004-Exploits is a technique used for initial access or maintaining access, not for lateral movement. It would not typically be used after discovery activities and before bypassing network segmentation.
   - D: T1070-Indicator Removal is a post-exploitation technique, which is used to remove evidence of the attack. It would not typically be used before bypassing network segmentation.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Lazarus group first gained initial access and performed discovery activities.
   - After discovery, they would likely perform lateral movement to move from the initial compromise point to other systems within the network. This is the purpose of T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer.
   - Only after they have moved laterally would they attempt to bypass network segmentation using compromised router virtual machines (T1036).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Discovery > Lateral Movement (T1570) > Network Segmentation Bypass (T1036).
