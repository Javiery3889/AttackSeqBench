 Final Answer: B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes that BlackSoul established communication with the C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to transfer data over the C2 channel.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Golden Ticket is a technique used to gain access to a domain without the need for a password, it doesn't directly relate to data transfer over the C2 channel.
   - B: Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol is a technique that involves transferring data from an compromised system to an external location using a non-C2 channel, which aligns with the use of RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
   - C: Automated Exfiltration is a technique that involves the use of scripts or automated tools to transfer data, but it doesn't specify the method of transfer, and the question mentions the use of a specific protocol (RESTful Strapi).
   - D: Archive Collected Data is a technique that involves storing data for later use, but it doesn't directly relate to the transfer of data over the C2 channel.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - BlackSoul established communication with the C2 server, which implies that data transfer is taking place.
   - The communication is using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding, which suggests a non-C2 channel for data transfer.
   - Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol is a technique that fits this description, as it involves transferring data from an compromised system to an external location using a non-C2 channel.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - T1080.001 - Initial Access (BlackSoul gained access to the system)
   - T1078 - Command and Control (BlackSoul established communication with the C2 server)
   - T1048.001 - Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol (Data transfer over the C2 channel)
