 Final Answer: C: Persistence

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the execution of the QuasarRAT dropper, allowing the malware to create and manage scheduled tasks on the victim's system to maintain beyond a reboot.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Reconnaissance (A) is typically used to gather information about the target system, not to create and manage scheduled tasks.
   - Lateral Movement (B) is used to move within a network, not to create and manage scheduled tasks on a single system.
   - Persistence (C) is the tactic used to ensure the malware remains on the system even after a reboot, which aligns with the creation and management of scheduled tasks.
   - Command and Control (D) is the tactic used to communicate with the malware after it has been deployed, but it doesn't directly relate to creating and managing scheduled tasks.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The QuasarRAT dropper is executed on the victim's system.
   - The dropper installs the QuasarRAT malware.
   - The QuasarRAT malware creates and manages scheduled tasks to ensure it remains on the system even after a reboot.
   - This sequence of events suggests that the Persistence tactic is the most likely tactic to have occurred after the execution of the QuasarRAT dropper.
