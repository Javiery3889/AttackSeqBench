 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN13 first employs techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and credential harvesting. These TTPs are associated with the Credential Access tactic.

2. Compare and Evaluate: After credential access, FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations. This sequence of TTPs aligns best with the Discovery tactic, as it involves the collection of information about the target environment.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The initial TTPs (process memory dumping and credential harvesting) are associated with the Credential Access tactic, as they involve gaining access to sensitive information (credentials).
   - After gaining access to credentials, FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations. This sequence of TTPs is associated with the Discovery tactic, as it involves the collection of information about the target environment.
   - The other answer choices (Command and Control, Reconnaissance) do not align as well with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. Command and Control is typically associated with maintaining communication between the attacker and compromised systems, while Reconnaissance is the initial phase of gathering information about the target before any direct interaction.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Credential Access (process memory dumping and credential harvesting)
   - Discovery (using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations)
