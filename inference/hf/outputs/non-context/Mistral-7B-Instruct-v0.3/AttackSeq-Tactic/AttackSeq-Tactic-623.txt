 Final Answer: C: Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred within the target network to locate relevant systems, users, and data before the collection of data.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Credential Access - This tactic is about obtaining, dumping, or stealing credentials. It doesn't directly involve locating systems, users, or data.
   - B: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving within a network after initial access, but it doesn't necessarily involve locating systems, users, or data.
   - C: Discovery - This tactic involves identifying resources within a network, which aligns with the question's requirement of locating relevant systems, users, and data.
   - D: Collection - This tactic involves gathering data, which comes after the discovery phase in the attack sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - To locate relevant systems, users, and data, an attacker would first need to discover them within the network. This is the logical first step before moving laterally or collecting data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Discovery (to locate systems, users, and data), followed by Lateral Movement (to move within the network), and finally Collection (to gather data).
   - Given the question's focus on the discovery phase, the answer is C: Discovery.
