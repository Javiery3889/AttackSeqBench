 Final Answer: A: Credential Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN13 (an advanced persistent threat group) dumped LSASS process memory and used network sniffing tools to obtain passwords, which is a method used for Credential Access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic of Credential Access (A) is the most plausible sequence after the TTPs mentioned in the question. The attacker has already escalated privileges and now uses these methods to obtain passwords, which is a common step in the Credential Access tactic.
   - Persistence (B) would typically involve setting up a mechanism to maintain access to the system, but in this case, the attacker has not yet established such a mechanism.
   - Reconnaissance (C) and Discovery (D) are initial stages of an attack, where an attacker gathers information about the target system. In this case, the attacker has already moved past the initial stages and is focusing on obtaining credentials.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Privilege Escalation (using ProcDump and Mimikatz)
   - Credential Access (using network sniffing tools to obtain passwords)
