 Final Answer: Credential Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution upon opening a crafted Excel document.
   - The question then mentions the use of T1003 (Registry Run Keys/Run Services) and T1214 (Regsvr32) to dump credentials from various registry keys.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access (A) refers to the first step in an attack, where an attacker gains access to a system. In this case, the attacker has already gained access through the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882.
   - Resource Development (B) is typically used to create tools, infrastructure, or prepare the environment for future attacks. In this context, it does not seem to be the most plausible choice as the attacker is immediately moving to dump credentials.
   - Credential Access (C) involves the acquisition of credentials to access resources. In this case, the attacker is using T1003 and T1214 to dump credentials from various registry keys, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.
   - Defense Evasion (D) is used to hide the presence of an attacker or the actions they are performing. In this sequence, the attacker has not yet attempted to evade detection, as they are directly moving to dump credentials.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - Initial Access (A) - Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882
   - Credential Access (C) - Dumping credentials from various registry keys using T1003 and T1214.
