 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) that are typically involved in a cyber attack.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the lateral movement within the compromised network.
   - Lateral movement is a technique under the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The question mentions the connection of V1 server to V2's SMB service, which is a technique under the "Lateral Movement" tactic.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access is the first step in any attack, but it doesn't necessarily have to occur before lateral movement. An attacker could gain initial access, perform some actions, and then move laterally.
   - Collection and Reconnaissance are usually performed before Initial Access, as they involve gathering information about the target network. However, they can also be performed during the later stages of an attack for further information gathering.
   - Execution is a tactic that involves running malicious code on the compromised system. This could be done after Initial Access and before lateral movement, as the malware needs to be executed on the V1 server before it can connect to V2's SMB service.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The most likely sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access -> Execution -> Lateral Movement.
   - The attacker would first gain access to the network, then execute malware on the V1 server, and finally use the malware to connect to V2's SMB service for lateral movement.
   - Final Answer: Execution.
