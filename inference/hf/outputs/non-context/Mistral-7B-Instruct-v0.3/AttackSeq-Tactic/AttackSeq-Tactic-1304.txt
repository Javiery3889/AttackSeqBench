 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Chinese APT actors deployed a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute their malware payload.
   - The tactic of deploying a dropper executable via DLL sideloading falls under the Execution tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access is the tactic that would typically come before Execution, as it involves gaining access to the target system. Once the attacker has Initial Access, they can then move laterally and execute their malware.
   - Exfiltration and Collection are tactics that occur after the Execution tactic, as they involve moving data out of the system (Exfiltration) or gathering data from the system (Collection).
   - Bypassing various security measures could be a part of Initial Access, Collection, or Exfiltration, but it doesn't directly relate to the sequence of TTPs in this question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (gaining access to the system) -> Execution (deploying a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute malware).
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the described sequence is Initial Access.

Final Answer: C: Initial Access.
