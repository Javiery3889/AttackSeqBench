 Final Answer: Command and Control (A)

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question mentions that APT33 operated a dozen live C&C servers to issue commands to targeted botnets. This indicates the Command and Control (C2) tactic, which is used to maintain persistence and control compromised systems.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Discovery (B) is a tactic used to gather information about the target environment. It does not directly follow the use of obfuscated C&C servers.
   - Defense Evasion (C) is a tactic used to avoid detection by security solutions. While it could be used to hide the C&C servers, it does not directly lead to the operation of live C&C servers.
   - Collection (D) is a tactic used to gather data from the target environment. It does not directly follow the operation of live C&C servers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - APT33 employed multiple layers of obfuscation for their C&C servers using cloud-hosted proxies (Defense Evasion). This step is taken to avoid detection and maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - After successfully evading detection, APT33 operated about a dozen live C&C servers to issue commands to narrowly targeted botnets (Command and Control). This step is taken to maintain persistence and control over the compromised systems.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Defense Evasion (C) followed by Command and Control (A). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the obfuscation of C&C servers, so the final answer is Command and Control (A).
