 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the Rising Sun implant performing initial reconnaissance and then establishing communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A: Command and Control (T1086) involves establishing communication with a remote server or other entity to receive instructions, report status, or exfiltrate data. Using encrypted HTTP POST requests to communicate with control servers is a common technique used in this tactic.
   - Answer choice B: Resource Development (T1583) is about creating or acquiring resources such as tools, infrastructure, or credentials. While this tactic can involve setting up communication channels, it does not specifically involve encrypted HTTP POST requests.
   - Answer choice C: Discovery (T1087) is about gathering information about the target environment. While this tactic can involve network communication, it does not specifically involve encrypted HTTP POST requests.
   - Answer choice D: Privilege Escalation (T1078) is about obtaining higher levels of access to a system or network. This tactic does not involve establishing communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance (T1080) to gather system and network information.
   - After gathering the necessary information, the next logical step would be to establish communication with control servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. This is the definition of the Command and Control (T1086) tactic, which involves using encrypted HTTP POST requests as mentioned in the question.
