 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Hidden Cobra used a specific exploit to download a DLL implant.
   - The tactic of Execution (T1053) is involved in the initial exploitation and download of the implant. However, the question asks about the tactic that occurred after this initial step.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Collection (T1041) could be a possible answer as it involves the gathering of information from the compromised system. This could happen after the initial implant is installed.
   - Persistence (T1055) is about maintaining access to a compromised system, which could be achieved by the implant. However, it's not clear if the implant was set up to persist at this point in the question.
   - Resource Development (T1077) is about creating or acquiring resources for future operations, which doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial TTP is Execution (T1053), which involves the exploitation and download of the implant.
   - After the implant is installed, it's likely that the attacker would want to gather information from the compromised system, which aligns with the Collection (T1041) tactic.
   - Persistence (T1055) could also be a possibility, but it's not explicitly stated in the question that the implant was set up to persist at this point.
   - Resource Development (T1077) doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

Final Answer: Collection (T1041) is the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred after Hidden Cobra used the CVE-2018-4878 Adobe Flash exploit embedded in a Word document to download the Bankshot DLL implant from falcancoin.io.
