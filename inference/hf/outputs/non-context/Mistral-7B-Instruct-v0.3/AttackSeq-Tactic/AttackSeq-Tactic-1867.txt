 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Deep Panda's Milestone backdoor established communication with its C2 server.
   - The TTP mentioned in the question is the establishment of communication between the backdoor and the C2 server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Command and Control - This tactic involves the establishment and use of C2 channels, which is what happened when the backdoor communicated with the C2 server. However, this tactic is not necessarily the one that occurs after the initial communication.
   - B: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. While it could potentially follow the initial communication, it's not the most likely choice as it doesn't directly follow the sequence of events described.
   - C: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving within a network to spread the attack. After establishing a C2 channel, the attacker could use this channel to move laterally within the network. This is a plausible sequence of events.
   - D: Exfiltration - This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While it could potentially follow the initial communication, it's not the most likely choice as it doesn't directly follow the sequence of events described.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the backdoor established communication with the C2 server.
   - The backdoor communicating with the C2 server is an action under the Command and Control tactic, but it's not the most likely tactic to occur after this event.
   - The Discovery tactic could potentially follow the initial communication, but it's not the most direct sequence of events.
   - The Lateral Movement tactic is a plausible sequence of events, as the attacker could use the established C2 channel to move laterally within the network.
   - The Exfiltration tactic could potentially follow the initial communication, but it's not the most direct sequence of events.

Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement.
