 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the Octopus malware gathering system information and communicating with hardcoded commercial web-hosting servers.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Lateral Movement typically involves moving within a network, which doesn't directly involve communication with external servers.
   - Discovery is about gathering information about the network and systems, which has already been done in the question.
   - Defense Evasion is a tactic used to avoid detection, and while it can involve communication with external servers, it doesn't seem to be the most likely next step after system information gathering.
   - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic that best fits the scenario described, as it involves communication between the malware and external servers to receive commands, which includes file uploads or downloads.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Gather System Information (Discovery) -> Communicate with C2 (Command and Control). However, the question asks for the next most likely tactic after the communication with C2, so the answer is Command and Control (C2).
