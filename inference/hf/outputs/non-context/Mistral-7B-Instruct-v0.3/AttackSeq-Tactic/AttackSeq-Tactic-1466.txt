 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the sequence of TTPs as follows: Social engineering, installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware, use of BlackEnergy plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs mentioned in the question suggest that the malware has been installed and is now being used for further actions such as credential harvesting and lateral movement. To facilitate these actions, the malware needs to communicate with an external server, which is typically done through Command and Control (C2) channels. The other tactics mentioned (Discovery, Impact, Collection) do not directly facilitate communication between the malware and an external server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After the employees were socially engineered to enable macros for the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware, the malware is now present on the compromised systems.
   - The malware is then used for credential harvesting and lateral movement, which requires communication with an external server to receive commands and instructions.
   - The tactic that facilitates this communication is Command and Control (C2). Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Social engineering -> Installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware -> Command and Control (C2) -> Credential harvesting and lateral movement.
