 Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Initial Access - This tactic refers to the first step in an attack where the attacker gains access to a system. However, in this case, the attackers have already gained initial access and are using the Explosive Trojan to spread further, so this is not the most likely answer.
   - C: Command and Control - This tactic refers to the establishment of a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. While this could be a subsequent step, it does not directly involve the spread of the Trojan across the network, so it's less likely than the other options.
   - D: Execution - This tactic refers to the execution of the attacker's intended goal, such as data theft or system damage. While this could be a subsequent step, it's less likely than the spread of the Trojan across the network, which is a necessary step to reach the execution phase.
   - B: Lateral Movement - This tactic refers to the movement of an attacker within a network, often after initial access has been gained. In this case, the attackers are using the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network, which aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attackers initially gained access to a system and installed the Explosive Trojan.
   - The Explosive Trojan is designed to spread manually across the network, which is a form of lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after the initial access and Trojan installation is Lateral Movement.
