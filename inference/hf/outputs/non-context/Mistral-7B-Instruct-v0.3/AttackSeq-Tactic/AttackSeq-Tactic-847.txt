 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Longhorn's malware communicated with their C&C servers.
   - The communication was done over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect the communications from identification.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Discovery (A) is about gathering information about the target environment. It doesn't directly follow the communication with the C&C server.
   - Exfiltration (B) involves sending data out of the compromised system. While it could follow communication with the C&C server, it doesn't necessarily have to.
   - Lateral Movement (C) is about moving within a network to spread the attack. This could follow communication with the C&C server, as the malware might need to move to other systems to carry out further actions.
   - Command and Control (D) is about maintaining persistence and managing the compromised system. This is a likely candidate, as the malware communicated with the C&C server, which suggests that it was under the attacker's control.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware communicated with the C&C server, which indicates that it was under the attacker's control.
   - To maintain control over the compromised system, the attacker would likely issue commands to the malware. This is the Command and Control (D) tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (for the malware to gain entry) -> Command and Control (for the attacker to maintain control) -> Lateral Movement (if the attacker decides to move the malware to other systems) -> Exfiltration (if the attacker decides to steal data) -> Discovery (if the attacker decides to gather more information about the target environment).
   - Final Answer: Command and Control (D).
