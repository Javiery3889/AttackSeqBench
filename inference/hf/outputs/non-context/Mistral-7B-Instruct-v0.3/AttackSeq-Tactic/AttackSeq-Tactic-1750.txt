 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the victim was enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes the victim being lured to a cloud-hosted file, followed by the execution of malware.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Discovery - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target environment. It doesn't directly involve luring the victim to a cloud-hosted file or executing malware.
   - B: Execution - This tactic involves the execution of malware, which is the final step in the sequence mentioned in the question. However, it doesn't explain the initial luring of the victim to a cloud-hosted file.
   - C: Initial Access - This tactic involves the adversary gaining access to a system. In this case, the initial access could be gained by the victim clicking on the malicious link, which leads to the download of the malware.
   - D: Persistence - This tactic involves the adversary ensuring their access persists after the initial compromise. Since we don't have information about the malware's behavior after execution, it's not clear if persistence has occurred yet.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that the victim was enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider. This action could be considered part of the Initial Access tactic, as it allows the adversary to gain access to the victim's system.
   - After gaining initial access, the malware is executed. This is the Execution tactic. However, since we don't have information about the sequence of events leading up to the Initial Access, it's more plausible that the Initial Access tactic occurred first.
   - The Discovery tactic doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of events mentioned in the question.
   - The Persistence tactic could occur after the Execution tactic, but since we don't have information about the malware's behavior after execution, it's not clear if persistence has occurred yet.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access (victim clicks on the malicious link) followed by Execution (malware execution).
