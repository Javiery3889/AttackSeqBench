 Final Answer: Reconnaissance

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after APT10 gained Initial Access and before establishing persistence.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are: Initial Access (DLL Side-Loading with jjs.exe), Execution (not explicitly mentioned but implied as the action after Initial Access), Reconnaissance (not explicitly mentioned but needed to find the target for persistence), Impact (not mentioned), and Persistence (service installation and Run registry key).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic that most likely occurred after Initial Access and before Persistence is Reconnaissance. This is because the attacker needs to gather information about the target system to determine where and how to establish persistence.
   - Execution is the tactic that follows Initial Access, but it is not the tactic that occurs between Initial Access and Persistence.
   - Impact is not relevant at this stage of the attack.
   - Persistence is the next step after Reconnaissance, but it is not the tactic that occurs between Initial Access and Persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attacker first gained Initial Access to the system.
   - After gaining Initial Access, the attacker would typically perform Reconnaissance to gather information about the target system.
   - Once the attacker has gathered enough information, they would establish Persistence to maintain access to the system.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred between Initial Access and Persistence is Reconnaissance.
