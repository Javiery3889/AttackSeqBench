 Final Answer: Exfiltration

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where sysOptimizer.bat collected and archived personal files, including keylogging and clipboard content. This is an act of data collection. After this, the components uploaded collected data and credentials, including Chrome passwords, to the FTP server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Collection: This tactic involves gathering data, which is what sysOptimizer.bat did. However, it does not necessarily lead to the next step in the sequence, which is uploading the data to an FTP server.
   - Lateral Movement: This tactic involves moving within a network, which does not seem to be related to uploading data to an FTP server.
   - Command and Control: This tactic is about establishing a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. However, it does not directly involve uploading data to an FTP server.
   - Exfiltration: This tactic involves stealing and transferring data from a compromised system to the attacker's system or a third-party system, which aligns best with the next step in the sequence, which is uploading the data to an FTP server.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Collection (sysOptimizer.bat) -> Exfiltration (uploading data to FTP server).
