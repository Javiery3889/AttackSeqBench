 Final Answer: A: Initial Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the TTP that occurred after gaining initial access and before collecting system information.
2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Initial Access refers to the first step in an attack where an attacker gains access to a system. In this case, the initial access was gained through the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 Office vulnerability.
   - B: Discovery refers to the process of gathering information about the target environment. However, in the sequence of events described, discovery would typically occur after initial access and before defense evasion or resource development.
   - C: Resource Development refers to the process of creating or acquiring resources for future attacks. This would likely occur after the attacker has gained access to the system and gathered information about it.
   - D: Defense Evasion is a tactic used to avoid detection by security solutions. This would likely occur after the attacker has gained access, discovered the system, and started executing their attack, but before collecting system information.
3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After gaining initial access through the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 Office vulnerability, the next logical step would be to maintain that access and move laterally within the network. This is the definition of the Initial Access tactic.
   - Once the attacker has maintained access, they would then likely move on to Discovery, Resource Development, or Defense Evasion, depending on their goals. However, the question asks for the TTP that occurred before collecting system information, which is not mentioned in the answer choices B, C, or D. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Initial Access.
