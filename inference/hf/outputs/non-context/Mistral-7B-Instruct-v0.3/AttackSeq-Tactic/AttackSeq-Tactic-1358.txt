 Final Answer: B: Execution

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved the use of Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute PowerShell commands.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Lateral Movement typically involves moving from one system to another within a network. While DDE can be used for lateral movement, it is more commonly associated with the Execution tactic as it is used to execute commands.
   - B: Execution is the tactic that involves executing unauthorized code on a system. The use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands falls under this tactic.
   - C: Impact is the tactic that involves causing data destruction, exfiltration, or modification. While the use of DDE and PowerShell could lead to impact, it is not the tactic that directly involves their use.
   - D: Initial Access is the tactic that involves gaining access to a system. While DDE can be used for initial access, it is not the primary purpose of DDE in this context.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the use of a malicious Word document, which suggests an Initial Access tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that involves the use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands.
   - DDE is a feature in Microsoft Office that can be used to execute commands. This is most likely part of the Execution tactic, as it involves executing unauthorized code on a system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (using the malicious Word document) followed by Execution (using DDE to execute PowerShell commands). However, the question asks for the tactic that involves DDE and PowerShell, so the answer is B: Execution.
