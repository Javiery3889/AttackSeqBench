 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with a spear-phishing attack exploiting Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) to deliver a secondary payload. The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes to install the payload.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic of Initial Access is the first step in any attack sequence, as it involves the attacker gaining access to the target system. In this case, the spear-phishing attack was the initial access method.
   - Resource Development, Collection, and Execution are not directly related to the initial access phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The spear-phishing attack was the Initial Access tactic, as it provided the attacker with the means to deliver the payload to the target system.
   - After the Initial Access, the attacker would have executed the ActionScript classes to install the payload, which corresponds to the Execution tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes, so we need to look at the sequence of events leading up to that point.
   - Since the Initial Access tactic is the first step in the attack sequence, it is the most likely tactic that occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes.

Final Answer: Initial Access (A)
