 Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes that APT15 gained domain administrator credentials and used Mimikatz for privilege escalation. Then, they enabled their RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves an attacker using various techniques to hide their presence, activities, or actions from the target's security measures. Enabling a backdoor to bypass policy settings can be considered a defense evasion technique as it allows the attacker to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted.
   - B: Privilege Escalation - This tactic involves an attacker gaining higher levels of access to a system or network. While APT15 did gain higher privileges through Mimikatz, the subsequent action of enabling the backdoor to bypass policy settings is not directly related to privilege escalation.
   - C: Discovery - This tactic involves an attacker gathering information about the target's network, systems, or data. Enabling a backdoor does not necessarily involve discovery, as the attacker already has the necessary information to perform this action.
   - D: Collection - This tactic involves an attacker gathering data from the target. While the backdoor could be used for data collection, the question specifically asks about the tactic that most likely followed the enabling of the backdoor, not the ultimate goal of the attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: APT15 gained domain administrator credentials and used Mimikatz for privilege escalation (Privilege Escalation tactic).
   - Step 2: APT15 enabled their RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution (Defense Evasion tactic). This action allows them to evade the target's security measures and perform actions that would otherwise be restricted.
