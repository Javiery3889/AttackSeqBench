 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker first gathers information about the victim's computer and then sends this information to a remote server. This action is typically associated with the Discovery and Reconnaissance phase of an attack. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred next, so we need to consider the remaining TTPs.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Impact: This tactic usually involves actions that cause harm or disrupt the victim's system, which doesn't seem to follow the sequence described in the question.
   - Exfiltration: This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's system, but the question mentions that the attacker is sending information to a remote server, not receiving it, which suggests that Exfiltration is not the most likely next step.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker has already gathered information about the victim's computer and sent it to a remote server, which is a common TTP associated with the Discovery phase.
   - The attacker then uses a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443. This TTP is often used for Command and Control (C2) communication, where the attacker establishes a connection with the victim's system to issue commands and further execute the attack.
   - Exfiltration, on the other hand, would typically occur after the attacker has gained access to the victim's system and has collected data, which is not the case in the sequence described in the question.

4. Conclusion: The most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is Discovery (gathering information) -> Command and Control (establishing a connection for further attack execution). Therefore, the answer is C: Command and Control.
