 Final Answer: A: Collection

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with gaining initial access through spear phishing emails containing malicious documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158. The attacker then establishes connections to C2 servers using backdoors such as HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOOT.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Collection (A) refers to the process of gathering intelligence on the target, which could include reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and credential harvesting. This tactic is often used before establishing a foothold in the target network, as it provides the attacker with the necessary information to move laterally and carry out further actions.
   - Command and Control (B) is the tactic used to maintain communication between the attacker and compromised systems. This tactic typically occurs after the attacker has established a foothold in the network.
   - Defense Evasion (C) is a tactic used to avoid detection by security solutions. This tactic could occur at any stage of the attack, but it is more likely to be used after the attacker has gained initial access and established a foothold in the network to avoid detection.
   - Resource Development (D) refers to the process of creating or acquiring tools, infrastructure, and capabilities for future attacks. This tactic is more likely to occur after the attacker has established a persistent presence in the target network and has a better understanding of the target's defenses.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the attacker gaining initial access through spear phishing emails containing malicious documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158. This TTP is part of the Initial Access tactic, but it is not the final step in the attack sequence.
   - The attacker then establishes connections to C2 servers using backdoors. This TTP is part of the Command and Control tactic, but it is not the first step in the attack sequence.
   - The attacker needs to gather intelligence on the target before establishing a foothold in the network. This intelligence could include information about the target's network architecture, user accounts, and security measures. This TTP is part of the Collection tactic.
   - Therefore, the Collection tactic (A) most likely occurred before the attacker established connections to C2 servers using backdoors (B).
