 Final Answer: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks. The TTPs mentioned in the question are Initial Access (exploited external servers), Defense Evasion (not explicitly mentioned but could be inferred from deploying web shells as a gateway), Reconnaissance (not explicitly mentioned), and Lateral Movement (not explicitly mentioned but could be inferred from establishing a foothold in victim networks).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access is the tactic that involves gaining unauthorized access to a system. In this case, FIN13 used exploited external servers to gain access, which is the first step in an attack sequence.
   - Reconnaissance is the gathering of information about a target before an attack. While this could be part of the attack sequence, it doesn't necessarily have to occur before Initial Access.
   - Defense Evasion and Lateral Movement are tactics that are typically used after Initial Access to maintain persistence and move within the network. They are less likely to occur before Initial Access.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (exploited external servers) followed by Defense Evasion (deployed web shells as a gateway), and then Lateral Movement (establishing a foothold in victim networks). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the sequence, so the answer is Initial Access.
