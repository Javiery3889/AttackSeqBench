 Final Answer: A: Execution

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the compromise of the Afghan Government's CDN server and the modification of a Javascript file to serve malicious code.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Execution (A) is the tactic that involves running unauthorized code on the victim's system. Modifying the Javascript file to serve malicious code is a form of executing unauthorized code.
   - Lateral Movement (B) is the tactic that involves moving within a network from the initial point of compromise to other systems, often to escalate privileges or gather more information. Since the question does not mention any movement within the network, this tactic is less likely.
   - Defense Evasion (C) is the tactic that involves taking steps to avoid detection by security solutions. Modifying a Javascript file to serve malicious code is not a typical defense evasion technique.
   - Initial Access (D) is the tactic that involves gaining access to a system. Since the question states that the CDN server has already been compromised, Initial Access is not the most likely tactic to follow.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the compromise of the CDN server, which implies that Initial Access has already been achieved.
   - The next step in the sequence is the modification of the Javascript file to serve malicious code, which is a form of Execution.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (achieved) -> Execution (modifying the Javascript file to serve malicious code). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely followed the modification of the Javascript file, the answer is Execution (A).
