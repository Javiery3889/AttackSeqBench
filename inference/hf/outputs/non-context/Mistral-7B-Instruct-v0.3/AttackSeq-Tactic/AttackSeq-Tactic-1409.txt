 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a supply chain attack where a trojanized version of the 3CX software was distributed, allowing Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems.
   - The tactic we are looking for is the one that most likely occurred after the Initial Access (the initial compromise of the system).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Execution (C) is the tactic that involves the execution of a malicious payload, which aligns with the infiltration of Smooth Operator malware into the macOS systems.
   - Discovery (A) is a tactic used to identify and gather information about the target environment, which typically happens before Initial Access.
   - Credential Access (B) is a tactic used to gain access to resources using stolen, dumped, or valid credentials, which could happen after Execution but not necessarily.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Initial Access has already been achieved through the trojanized 3CX software.
   - The malware (Smooth Operator) is then executed, which allows it to infiltrate the macOS systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (1) -> Execution (2).

Final Answer: Execution (C)
