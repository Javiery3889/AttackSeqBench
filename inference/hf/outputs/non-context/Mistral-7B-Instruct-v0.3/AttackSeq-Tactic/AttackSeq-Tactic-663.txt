 To answer this question, we need to understand the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are typically involved in a cyber attack.

1. Initial Access: This is the first step where an attacker gains access to a system.
2. Discovery: After initial access, the attacker gathers information about the system and its environment.
3. Persistence: The attacker establishes persistence to maintain access to the system even after reboots or other actions that might otherwise terminate the connection.
4. Execution: The attacker executes their malicious code on the compromised system.

In the question, it is mentioned that the OceanLotus threat actors used base64 blobs in malicious Office documents to match the victim's system architecture and execute them. This suggests that the Execution tactic is the most likely choice.

However, to execute malware, the attacker must have already gained access to the system (Initial Access) and gathered information about the system architecture (Discovery). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Initial Access and Discovery occurred before Execution.

Persistence is not necessarily a prerequisite for Execution, as the attacker could execute their malware during the initial session and then disconnect, or they could establish persistence after execution.

So, while it's possible that Persistence occurred before Execution, it's not a requirement for the sequence described in the question. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this case would be Initial Access, Discovery, and then Execution.

Final Answer: The Initial Access tactic most likely occurred before the OceanLotus threat actors leveraged base64 blobs in malicious Office documents to match the victim's system architecture and execute them.
