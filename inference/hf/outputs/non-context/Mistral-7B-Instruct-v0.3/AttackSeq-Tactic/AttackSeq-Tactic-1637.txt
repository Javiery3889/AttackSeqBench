 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the delivery of the NetTraveler Trojan through spear-phishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158. This indicates that the Initial Access tactic has been achieved.
   - The question then mentions lookalike news and military domains facilitating communication with compromised systems. This suggests that the attacker is maintaining control over the compromised systems, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - The other options, Resource Development and Exfiltration, do not seem to be directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access: This tactic is the initial step in an attack, and it seems that the attacker has already gained access to the systems.
   - Resource Development: This tactic involves creating or acquiring resources such as tools, infrastructure, or information to support future operations. The described TTPs do not indicate any resource development activities.
   - Command and Control: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems to control them. The described TTPs suggest that the attacker is communicating with compromised systems, making this the most plausible choice.
   - Exfiltration: This tactic involves stealing data from a compromised system. The described TTPs do not indicate any data exfiltration activities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: The attacker delivered the NetTraveler Trojan through spear-phishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158, which allowed them to gain access to the targeted systems.
   - Command and Control: After gaining initial access, the attacker used lookalike news and military domains to facilitate communication with the compromised systems, allowing them to maintain control over the systems and potentially execute further commands.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access (delivering the NetTraveler Trojan) followed by Command and Control (using lookalike domains for communication).
