 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Scote malware evades detection and then retrieves information from external sources (Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts) to establish communications with its servers.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Defense Evasion (A) is a tactic used to avoid detection by security solutions. While it is a common initial step, it does not directly involve the retrieval of information or communication with servers.
   - Reconnaissance (B) is the gathering of information about a target before an attack. While it can involve information retrieval, it does not necessarily involve communication with servers.
   - Command and Control (C) is the tactic used to maintain communication between the attacker and compromised systems. This tactic often involves the use of external sources for communication, such as C2 servers, which aligns with the described TTP of retrieving information from external sources (Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts).
   - Exfiltration (D) is the act of stealing data from a compromised system. While it can involve communication with external servers, it does not directly involve the initial retrieval of information from external sources like Pastebin or Google+.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware first evades detection to avoid being detected by security solutions (Defense Evasion).
   - After successfully evading detection, the malware retrieves information from external sources (Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts) to establish a communication channel with its servers (Command and Control).
   - This sequence of TTPs aligns best with the tactic of Command and Control (C).
