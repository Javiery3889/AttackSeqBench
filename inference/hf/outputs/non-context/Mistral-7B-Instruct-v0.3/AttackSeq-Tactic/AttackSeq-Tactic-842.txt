 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Longhorn employed practices such as in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols.
   - The mentioned TTPs (Techniques, Techniques, and Procedures) related to these practices can be found in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Defense Evasion" and "Persistence" tactics. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred before these, which suggests we should look for tactics that lead to Initial Access, Reconnaissance, or Resource Development.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Exfiltration - This tactic is about stealing data from a compromised system, which typically happens after Initial Access, Reconnaissance, and Resource Development. It does not usually occur before Defense Evasion and Persistence.
   - B: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security solutions, which is often employed after Initial Access to maintain persistence and carry out further actions. It seems plausible that this tactic could occur before the specific TTPs mentioned, as they are defense evasion techniques themselves.
   - C: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, which is typically done before Initial Access to understand the target better. However, it does not directly involve the TTPs mentioned.
   - D: Initial Access - This tactic involves gaining access to a system. It is the first step in an attack and could potentially lead to the TTPs mentioned.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before Longhorn employed practices such as in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols.
   - The TTPs related to these practices are Defense Evasion and Persistence tactics, which suggest that the attacker has already gained access to the system and is trying to maintain that access.
   - Given that these TTPs are part of the Defense Evasion and Persistence tactics, it is reasonable to assume that the Initial Access tactic occurred before these, as it is the first step in an attack.

Final Answer: D: Initial Access.
