 Final Answer: B: Collection

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the CostaRicto Campaign utilizing process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery through the SombRAT backdoor and archiving the gathered information using a custom storage file format.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access (A) refers to the first step in an attack where an adversary gains access to a system. However, the question mentions that the CostaRicto Campaign has already gained access through the SombRAT backdoor.
   - Resource Development (C) is typically about creating tools, infrastructure, or other resources for future attacks. While the attacker may have developed resources for future attacks, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after the information gathering.
   - Discovery (D) includes tactics like network discovery, system discovery, and asset discovery. The CostaRicto Campaign has already performed these actions as mentioned in the question.
   - Collection (B) is the tactic that involves gathering and exfiltrating data from a compromised system. The CostaRicto Campaign has gathered information and archived it, which aligns with the Collection tactic.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign has already gained access to the system through the SombRAT backdoor (Initial Access).
   - They have performed Discovery tactics (network, system, and asset discovery) to gather information about the system.
   - After discovering the system, they collected and archived the information using a custom storage file format. This action aligns with the Collection tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Discovery (already performed) -> Collection (performed after information gathering and archiving).
