 Final Answer: B: Initial Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely involved delivering malicious documents with filenames related to current events.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Resource Development typically involves the creation or acquisition of tools, infrastructure, or resources used in an attack. It does not involve delivering malicious documents.
   - B: Initial Access is the tactic that involves gaining unauthorized access to a system. Delivering malicious documents is a common method for Initial Access.
   - C: Execution involves running the malware on the compromised system. While the malicious document could be a means to this end, it is not the execution itself.
   - D: Credential Access involves obtaining, modifying, or using credentials to gain access to a system. While this could potentially follow the delivery of a malicious document, it does not directly involve the delivery itself.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely involved delivering malicious documents.
   - Initial Access is the tactic that involves gaining unauthorized access to a system.
   - Delivering malicious documents is a common method for Initial Access, as it allows an attacker to trick a user into opening the document and thus compromising the system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (delivering malicious documents) followed by Execution (running the malware on the compromised system).

In this case, the question does not provide information about the sequence after Initial Access, so we cannot definitively say what tactic would follow Initial Access in this specific scenario. However, based on the information given, it is clear that the most plausible answer for the tactic that involved delivering malicious documents is Initial Access.
