 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the iOS malware was installed on compromised systems but before it started gathering information.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are: Installation (of malware), Command and Control, Execution, and Discovery.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Execution (A) is the act of running a program or command. This could be the malware gathering information, which is not the case according to the question.
   - Resource Development (B) is typically about creating or acquiring resources for future use, such as building a botnet or creating a new command and control infrastructure. This doesn't seem to be directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.
   - Command and Control (C) is the tactic used to maintain communication between the attacker and the compromised system. This could be the next step after the malware is installed, as it allows the attacker to issue commands to the malware, such as starting the data gathering process.
   - Discovery (D) is about gathering information about the target environment. This could happen before the malware is installed, as part of the reconnaissance phase, or after the data gathering phase, when the attacker is trying to learn more about the data they have already collected.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events in the question is: Malware installation, then data gathering.
   - Command and Control (C) is the tactic that allows the attacker to issue commands to the malware, which could include starting the data gathering process. Therefore, it is the most plausible answer.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control.
