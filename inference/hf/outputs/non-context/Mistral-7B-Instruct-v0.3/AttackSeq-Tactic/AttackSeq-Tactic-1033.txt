 Final Answer: Execution

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application. This event falls under the Execution tactic, as it involves the execution of the malware on the target system.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Persistence (A) would typically occur after the malware has been executed and established a foothold on the system, to ensure its continued presence even after a reboot. However, it does not necessarily have to occur before an automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers.
   - Exfiltration (B) involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to an attacker-controlled system. This tactic usually occurs after the attacker has gained access to the data they want to exfiltrate, which has not been established in the question yet.
   - Initial Access (C) refers to the first step in the attack chain, where the attacker gains access to the target system. In this case, the delivery of the malware is not the initial access, as the attacker already has access to the scanner application.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application. This event falls under the Execution tactic, as it involves the execution of the malware on the target system.
   - After the malware is executed, it may establish persistence on the system to ensure its continued presence even after a reboot. However, this persistence has not been mentioned in the question yet.
   - The question then mentions an automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers. This event suggests that the attacker is now using the compromised system to launch further attacks, which requires the malware to be executed first.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is: Delivery -> Execution -> Automated Attack (using SMB protocol targeted servers).
