 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware first determines the presence of certain security software (360 Safe Guard or 360 Internet Security), then chooses its installation method accordingly.
   - After this, the malware uses dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Collection tactic does not seem to fit the sequence as it involves gathering data and resources before further action, and it doesn't necessarily involve choosing installation methods based on the presence of security software.
   - Persistence tactic involves establishing a foothold on a compromised system to maintain access, which doesn't seem to follow the sequence as it doesn't involve choosing installation methods based on the presence of security software.
   - Discovery tactic involves identifying the presence of specific software, hardware, or users, which aligns well with the sequence as the malware first determines the presence of security software.
   - Defense Evasion tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which aligns well with the sequence as the malware uses dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection after the initial steps.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware first determines the presence of security software (Discovery tactic).
   - Then, it chooses its installation method accordingly (this step is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but it seems reasonable to assume that the malware would choose an installation method based on the presence of security software, which could be part of the Initial Access or Execution tactic, but for the sake of the question, we'll focus on the Discovery tactic).
   - Finally, the malware uses dynamic function calls and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection (Defense Evasion tactic).

Final Answer: The Discovery tactic most likely occurred before the Defense Evasion tactic, but it's not explicitly stated in the question that the Initial Access or Execution tactic occurred after the Discovery tactic. However, based on the sequence of events described, it seems reasonable to assume that the Initial Access or Execution tactic would occur after the Discovery tactic. So, the answer would be: Discovery (most likely), Initial Access/Execution (implied but not explicitly stated), Defense Evasion.
