 To answer this question, we need to understand the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the sequence of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that an attacker might use.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the SBDH malware contacted a remote server.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are Initial Access, Execution, Command and Control, and Lateral Movement.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access is the first step in an attack where an attacker gains access to a system. Once Initial Access is achieved, other TTPs can follow.
   - Execution refers to the running of malicious code on a compromised system. This could happen after Initial Access, but it doesn't necessarily have to be before the malware contacts a remote server.
   - Command and Control and Lateral Movement are tactics that typically occur after the malware has been executed and has established a connection to a remote server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The most logical sequence would be: Initial Access (to gain access to the system) -> Execution (to run the malware) -> Command and Control (to establish a connection for further commands) -> Lateral Movement (to move within the network).
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the SBDH malware contacted a remote server is Initial Access.

Final Answer: Initial Access.
