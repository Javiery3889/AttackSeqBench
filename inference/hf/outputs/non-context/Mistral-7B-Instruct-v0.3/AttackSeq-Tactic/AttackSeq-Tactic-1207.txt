 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BlueBravo's malware gathers victim system information and then establishes encrypted HTTPS communication using RC4 and Base64 encoding.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Resource Development (A) typically involves activities like data gathering for future use, but it doesn't directly involve establishing communication.
   - Discovery (B) involves information gathering, which aligns with the initial TTP of the malware gathering system information.
   - Execution (C) usually refers to the execution of malicious code or scripts, but it doesn't directly involve establishing communication.
   - Command and Control (D) is about maintaining persistence and communication between the attacker and compromised systems, which is what happens after the initial communication is established.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware first gathers system information (Discovery).
   - After gathering the information, it establishes encrypted communication (Command and Control). However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to enable the communication, we should look for the tactic that leads to the communication setup, which is Discovery.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Discovery (information gathering) leading to Command and Control (establishing encrypted communication). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to enable the communication, so the answer is B: Discovery.
