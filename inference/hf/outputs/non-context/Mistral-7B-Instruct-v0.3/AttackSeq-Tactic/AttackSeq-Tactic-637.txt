 Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is Reconnaissance (gathering information about the target), Initial Access (spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers), and then the ultimate goal, which is the attack on ICS control workstations.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Command and Control is a tactic used after Initial Access to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system. It does not provide information about the strategic targeting of ICS control workstations.
   - B: Resource Development is a tactic used to build capabilities for future operations, such as creating malware or recruiting insiders. It does not directly relate to the strategic targeting of ICS control workstations.
   - C: Collection is a tactic used to gather data from the compromised system. While this could be part of the process, it does not explain the strategic targeting of ICS control workstations.
   - D: Reconnaissance is the tactic used to gather information about the target before an attack. This tactic would provide the information needed to strategically target ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - First, GreyEnergy would need to gather information about potential targets (Reconnaissance).
   - Once they have identified ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers as a potential target, they would then use spearphishing and compromise public-facing web servers to gain Initial Access.
   - Finally, they would use the information gathered during the Reconnaissance phase to strategically attack the identified ICS control workstations.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Reconnaissance (D) before Initial Access (spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers).
