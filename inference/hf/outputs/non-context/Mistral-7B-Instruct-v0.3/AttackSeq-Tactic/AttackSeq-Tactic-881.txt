 Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the sequence of TTPs as follows: ADFind (gathering network information) and port scanning. The attackers then propagated beacons to other systems within the network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. While it could be a part of the initial reconnaissance phase, it doesn't directly relate to propagating beacons to other systems.
   - B: Execution - This tactic involves executing malicious code on the compromised system. While it could be a part of the attack sequence, it doesn't directly relate to propagating beacons to other systems.
   - C: Defense Evasion - This tactic involves the attacker taking steps to avoid detection by security solutions. This doesn't directly relate to propagating beacons to other systems.
   - D: Lateral Movement - This tactic involves moving within a network to spread the attack or compromise. After gathering network information through ADFind and port scanning, it is likely that the attackers would use this information to move laterally within the network and propagate beacons to other systems.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Discovery (gathering network information), Execution (compromising the initial system), and Lateral Movement (propagating beacons to other systems). However, the question only asks about the next step after propagating beacons, so the answer is D: Lateral Movement.
