 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the use of credential-stealing modules and monitoring network traffic, which are techniques often used in the Initial Access and Collection phases of an attack. However, the subsequent action of locating processes and memory utilization across the infected system is more indicative of the Discovery phase, where an attacker seeks to understand the target environment.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Collection (A) is the tactic where an attacker gathers data from the target, but it does not necessarily involve discovering processes and memory utilization.
   - Discovery (B) is the tactic where an attacker seeks to understand the target environment, including locating processes and memory utilization.
   - Reconnaissance (C) is the initial phase of an attack where an attacker collects information about the target before launching an attack. It does not necessarily involve locating processes and memory utilization.
   - Initial Access (D) is the phase where an attacker gains access to the target system. While it may involve some discovery, it does not specifically involve locating processes and memory utilization to the extent described in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the use of credential-stealing modules and monitoring network traffic, which are techniques often used in the Initial Access and Collection phases.
   - After gaining access and collecting data, the attacker would likely want to understand the target environment to plan further actions. This understanding includes locating processes and memory utilization, which is a Discovery tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Initial Access (or Collection) -> Discovery.
