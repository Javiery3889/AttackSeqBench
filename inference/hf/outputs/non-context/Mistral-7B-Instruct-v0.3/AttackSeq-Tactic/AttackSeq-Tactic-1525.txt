 Final Answer: B: Initial Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before RIG EK gained initial access.
2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Resource Development (A) is typically about building tools, infrastructure, or resources for future attacks. It doesn't directly relate to gaining initial access.
   - Exfiltration (C) is about stealing data from a compromised system, which happens after initial access has been gained.
   - Impact (D) is about causing damage or disrupting the targeted system, which also occurs after initial access.
   - Initial Access (B) is the tactic that involves gaining access to a system, which is a prerequisite for the RIG EK to gain access through malvertising and redirecting users.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (B) -> RIG EK Gains Initial Access (through malvertising and redirecting users to compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript).
