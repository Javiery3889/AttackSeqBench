 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - The RoyalDNS backdoor is a tool used for maintaining persistence on a victim's network and communicating using DNS.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Persistence - Since the RoyalDNS backdoor is designed to maintain persistence, this tactic is already achieved. However, we are looking for a tactic that occurred after the deployment of the backdoor.
   - B: Resource Development - This tactic involves the creation or acquisition of resources such as tools, infrastructure, or data. While the backdoor is a resource, it's not clear that additional resources were developed after its deployment.
   - C: Privilege Escalation - This tactic involves gaining higher levels of access to a system. After deploying the backdoor, APT15 might have used it to move laterally within the network or escalate privileges, but this is not explicitly stated.
   - D: Exfiltration - This tactic involves the theft of data from a system. After deploying the backdoor and potentially gaining higher privileges, APT15 might have used the backdoor to exfiltrate data from the victim's network.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor, APT15 has established persistence on the victim's network. They might have used the backdoor to move laterally within the network or escalate privileges, but this is not explicitly stated. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the backdoor deployment, and exfiltration is a logical next step after gaining access and potentially escalating privileges.
   - Final Answer: D: Exfiltration.
