 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after FIN7 gained admin privileges and before the exfiltration of data.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     a. Gaining admin privileges using RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT (Initial Access and Command and Control)
     b. Exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client (Exfiltration)

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Collection tactic involves gathering data from the victim environment, which could be before or after gaining admin privileges, but it doesn't necessarily have to happen before exfiltration.
   - Credential Access tactic is about obtaining, modifying, or validating credentials, which FIN7 has already done to gain admin privileges.
   - Defense Evasion tactic is used to avoid detection, which is less likely to occur after gaining admin privileges and before exfiltration, as the attacker already has control of the system.
   - Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the victim environment, which could be after gaining admin privileges but before exfiltration. However, it's more likely that the attacker would perform discovery after installing the PowerShell RAT, as it would provide more information about the network.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After gaining admin privileges, FIN7 installed a PowerShell RAT to maintain control and have a persistent presence on the system. This action falls under the Command and Control tactic.
   - Before exfiltrating data, it's more likely that the attacker would perform Discovery to gather more information about the network and locate valuable data.

Final Answer: Discovery.
