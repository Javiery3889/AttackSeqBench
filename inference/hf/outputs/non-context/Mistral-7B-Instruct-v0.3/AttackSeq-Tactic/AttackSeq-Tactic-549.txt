 Final Answer: B: Credential Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes UNC1151 gaining initial access through spear phishing campaigns and then stealing victim credentials via spoofed websites.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic of Initial Access (A) refers to the first step of an attack, which is gaining access to the target system. In this case, UNC1151 has already gained initial access.
   - The tactic of Exfiltration (A) refers to the act of stealing data from the target system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred during the effort to steal credentials, not data.
   - The tactic of Discovery (C) refers to the process of gathering information about the target system or network. While this could be part of the process to set up the spoofed websites, it does not directly relate to stealing credentials.
   - The tactic of Credential Access (B) is the most appropriate as it refers to the techniques used to obtain, dump, or otherwise acquire credentials. In this case, UNC1151 is trying to steal victim credentials via spoofed websites, making Credential Access the most likely tactic.

3. Provide a Step-by-step Reasoning:
   - UNC1151 gained initial access to the target system through spear phishing campaigns (Initial Access).
   - After gaining access, UNC1151 set up spoofed websites to steal victim credentials (Credential Access).
   - The data exfiltration (Exfiltration) could occur after the credentials are stolen, but it is not the tactic that occurred during the effort to steal the credentials.
   - Discovery (Discovery) could be part of the process to set up the spoofed websites, but it does not directly relate to stealing credentials.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access -> Credential Access.
