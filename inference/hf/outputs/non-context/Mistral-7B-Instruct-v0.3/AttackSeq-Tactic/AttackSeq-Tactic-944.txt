 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with gaining initial access through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Reconnaissance (B) typically involves gathering information about the target environment before an attack. However, it doesn't directly relate to the execution of PowerShell scripts or the decoding of backdoor components.
   - Execution (A) is the tactic that involves running malicious code, which is what happens when the PowerShell scripts are executed. But we are asked to find the tactic that occurred before this event.
   - Lateral Movement (D) is a tactic used to move within a network after initial access has been gained. It doesn't directly relate to the events described in the question.
   - Initial Access (C) is the tactic that involves gaining access to a system. In this case, the initial access was gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document, and it makes sense that after gaining initial access, the attacker would execute PowerShell scripts to further their attack, which is the next step in the sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before PowerShell scripts were executed.
   - The initial access was gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros.
   - After gaining initial access, it is logical that the attacker would perform actions to further their attack, such as executing PowerShell scripts to decode and run embedded backdoor components.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before PowerShell scripts were executed is Initial Access (C).
