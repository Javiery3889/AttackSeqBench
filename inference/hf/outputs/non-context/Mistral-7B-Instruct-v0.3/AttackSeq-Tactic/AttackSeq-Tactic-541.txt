 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the NewPass agent established communication with the command-and-control server and used a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Command and Control - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining communication with the command-and-control server, which is the initial step in the sequence described.
   - B: Exfiltration - This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While it could potentially follow the initial communication, it doesn't necessarily have to, as the attacker might want to perform other actions first.
   - C: Discovery - This tactic involves gathering information about the compromised system. While this could potentially happen after initial communication, using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests is not a typical TTP for this tactic.
   - D: Collection - This tactic involves gathering data from the compromised system. Similar to Exfiltration, it could potentially follow the initial communication, but it doesn't necessarily have to, and using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests is not a typical TTP for this tactic.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is:
     - Establishing communication with the command-and-control server
     - Using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests
   - The tactic that most likely follows this sequence is the one that involves using the established communication channel for further actions.
   - Exfiltration and Discovery could potentially follow, but they are not as directly related to the initial communication and custom encryption as Command and Control is.

Final Answer: A: Command and Control.
