 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that includes operations over HTTP for communication and command retrieval from its C&C server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Lateral Movement typically involves moving within a network, not necessarily using HTTP for communication or command retrieval.
   - B: Discovery involves information gathering, but it doesn't necessarily include HTTP for communication or command retrieval.
   - C: Command and Control (C2) involves establishing a connection to a remote server for command and control, which can be done over HTTP.
   - D: Impact is about causing harm or disrupting systems, not necessarily involving HTTP for communication or command retrieval.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that Grandoreiro collects victim information and then communicates and retrieves commands from its C&C server over HTTP.
   - This sequence of TTPs aligns best with the Command and Control (C2) tactic, as it involves establishing a connection to a remote server for command and control, which can be done over HTTP.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Information Gathering (Discovery) -> Command and Control (C2). However, the question asks for the tactic that includes HTTP for communication and command retrieval, so the answer is Command and Control (C2).
