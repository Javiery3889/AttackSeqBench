 Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the execution of an obfuscated VBScript named 'PlayList.vbs' using 'wscript.exe'. The script is then deleted before communicating with the C2 server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Persistence (A) refers to techniques that ensure the attacker's access persists over time, such as setting up a scheduled task or modifying the system's registry. In this case, there is no indication that the attacker is trying to establish persistence.
   - Lateral Movement (C) involves moving from one compromised system to another within a network. Deleting the script before moving to the next system does not seem to align with this tactic.
   - Credential Access (D) is about obtaining, modifying, or validating credentials to access resources. Deleting the script does not seem to be related to this tactic.
   - Defense Evasion (B) includes techniques that help the attacker hide their presence, such as obfuscating scripts, using legitimate tools in unintended ways, or deleting logs. In this case, deleting the script after execution to evade detection aligns best with the Defense Evasion tactic.
