 Final Answer: Defense Evasion

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question mentions that AES128-CBC and RC4 encryption were used to evade defenses. This tactic falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Defense Evasion.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Exfiltration typically occurs after data has been collected and is being sent out of the network. It does not necessarily involve encryption to evade defenses.
   - Discovery is about gathering information about the network, systems, and data. It does not involve encryption.
   - Collection is the process of gathering data from the target. While it could be a precursor to Defense Evasion, there's no indication in the question that data collection occurred before the encryption.
   - Since Defense Evasion is the tactic that involves the use of encryption to evade defenses, it is the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the detection of MsBuild.exe processes.

Therefore, the most likely sequence of TTPs is: Defense Evasion (encryption) -> <unknown TTP> (possibly Collection or Discovery) -> SUNSPOT detected MsBuild.exe processes.
