 Final Answer: Initial Access

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question mentions that malicious emails containing trojaned attachments were sent to Tibetan organizations. This suggests the Initial Access tactic, as it involves gaining access to a system through a user's interaction (in this case, opening the malicious email attachment).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Resource Development is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Execution would come after the malware is injected into a process, not before.
   - Impact is the final stage of an attack, where the attacker achieves their goal, such as data theft or system destruction. In this case, the impact stage has not been reached yet, as the 'Surtr' malware has not been executed.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Initial Access tactic is the first step in the attack chain, where the attacker gains access to a system. In this case, the malicious email with the trojaned attachment is the means of initial access.
   - After the initial access, the attacker would likely perform some reconnaissance or lateral movement, but those steps are not mentioned in the question.
   - The next TTP mentioned in the question is the execution of the 'Surtr' malware, which involves injecting it into a newly created explorer or iexplore process. This suggests that the Execution tactic would occur after Initial Access.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access (sending malicious emails) -> <unmentioned steps> -> Execution (executing 'Surtr' malware).
