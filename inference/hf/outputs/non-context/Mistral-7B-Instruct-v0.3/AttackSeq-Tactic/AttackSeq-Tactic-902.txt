 Final Answer: Initial Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic most likely involved in delivering the malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications before WinDealer's persistence was achieved through the registry's RUN key.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Collection: This tactic involves gathering data from the target, but it doesn't directly involve delivering malware.
   - Execution: This tactic involves running malicious code, but it doesn't necessarily involve the delivery of malware through an automatic update mechanism.
   - Reconnaissance: This tactic involves gathering information about the target, but it doesn't directly involve delivering malware.
   - Initial Access: This tactic involves gaining access to a system, and delivering malware through an automatic update mechanism falls under this category as it allows the attacker to gain access to the system and execute their malware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely involved in delivering the malware.
   - Delivering malware is part of the Initial Access tactic, as it involves gaining access to a system and executing the malware.
   - The automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications is a common method for delivering malware, as it can bypass security measures and appear as a legitimate update.
   - Therefore, the Initial Access tactic is the most plausible sequence of TTPs before WinDealer's persistence was achieved through the registry's RUN key.
