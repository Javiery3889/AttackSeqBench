 Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts before the Darkhotel APT gained initial access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Resource Development typically involves building and maintaining resources for future operations, such as creating malware or recruiting actors. It does not involve gathering information about victims' whereabouts.
   - C: Initial Access refers to the first step in an attack, where the attacker gains access to a system. It does not necessarily involve gathering information about victims' whereabouts.
   - D: Command and Control is a tactic used after initial access has been gained, to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems. It does not involve gathering information about victims' whereabouts.
   - B: Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about a target before an attack. This includes identifying potential victims, their locations, and other relevant information. In this case, it is the most plausible TTP that would involve obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks for the TTP that most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
   - Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about a target, which includes identifying potential victims and their locations.
   - The Darkhotel APT is known for targeting hotel guests, so it is likely that they would need to gather information about their victims' whereabouts as part of their reconnaissance phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible TTP that would involve obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts is Reconnaissance.
