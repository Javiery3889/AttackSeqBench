 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that SWEED exploited CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document, which falls under the Execution tactic.
   - The question also mentions that they employed techniques such as T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) for stealth, which are part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Privilege Escalation is the process of exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher access rights, which typically happens after initial execution and before defense evasion.
   - Resource Development is the creation or acquisition of resources for future use, which is not directly related to the sequence of events mentioned in the question.
   - Execution, as mentioned earlier, is the initial step in the attack sequence.
   - Defense Evasion is the tactic that comes after Execution and before File Deletion and Software Packing, as these techniques are used to hide the presence of the attacker in the system.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after Execution (exploiting CVE-2017-11882) and before Defense Evasion (File Deletion and Software Packing).
   - The only tactic that fits this sequence is Privilege Escalation, as it is a common step in an attack sequence where an attacker would gain higher access rights before attempting to hide their presence.

Final Answer: Privilege Escalation.
