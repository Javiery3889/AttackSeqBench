 Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Stuxnet used rootkit functionality for hiding its presence, used stolen digital certificates for evasion, and exploited MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - A: Defense Evasion - This tactic is related to techniques that an adversary uses to conceal their presence, which is already mentioned in the question. However, it does not directly relate to the spreading of the malware across networked systems.
   - B: Execution - This tactic is related to the initial execution of the malware, which is not the focus of the question as the malware is already assumed to be present.
   - C: Lateral Movement - This tactic is related to the spreading of the malware across networked systems, which is the focus of the question.
   - D: Command and Control - This tactic is related to the communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which is not directly mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes Stuxnet spreading across networked systems after employing rootkit functionality and using stolen digital certificates for evasion. This sequence of events suggests that the malware is moving laterally within the network, which aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: Lateral Movement.
