 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker identifies installed software through GET requests sent by Microsoft Word and bypasses detection by using an undocumented Word feature.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Initial Access (A) typically refers to the first step in an attack where an attacker gains access to a system. In this case, the attacker is already using Microsoft Word, which implies they have some level of access to the system.
   - Discovery (B) refers to the process of gathering information about the target before launching an attack. In this case, the attacker is discovering information about the installed software, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - Credential Access (C) usually involves stealing, dumping, or otherwise obtaining credentials to access resources. The sequence of TTPs does not suggest that the attacker is trying to access credentials at this point.
   - Defense Evasion (D) is about the techniques used to avoid detection by security solutions. While the attacker is bypassing detection, the initial TTP of sending GET requests to identify software suggests a Discovery tactic, which occurred before the Defense Evasion tactic.

3. Provide a Step-by-step Reasoning:
   - The attacker is using Microsoft Word, which implies they have some level of access to the system. This access could have been gained through various means, but it's not the focus of the question.
   - The attacker is sending GET requests to identify installed software, which is a Discovery tactic. This is the first step in the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - After discovering the installed software, the attacker bypasses detection by using an undocumented Word feature. This is a Defense Evasion tactic, but it occurs after the Discovery tactic.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is Discovery (B) followed by Defense Evasion (D).
