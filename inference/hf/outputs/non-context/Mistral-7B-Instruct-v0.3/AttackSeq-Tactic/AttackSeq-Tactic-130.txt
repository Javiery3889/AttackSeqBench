 Final Answer: Collection

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before files were automatically exfiltrated using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Impact.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Discovery (A) is the initial phase where an adversary gathers information about the target network. However, it doesn't directly involve the exfiltration of files.
   - Lateral Movement (B) is the phase where an adversary moves within a network to reach other systems. While it could be a part of the sequence, it doesn't necessarily have to occur before file exfiltration.
   - Impact (C) is the phase where an adversary takes action to disrupt, destroy, or modify the targeted system. This doesn't seem to be related to the exfiltration of files.
   - Collection (D) is the phase where an adversary gathers data from the target. This seems to be the most plausible choice as it involves the gathering of files of interest, which could then be exfiltrated.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that files of interest were discovered and system information was gathered, which aligns with the Collection tactic.
   - After collecting the files, the adversary would likely move to the next phase, which is exfiltration. The question mentions that the files were automatically exfiltrated using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections, which suggests the use of Lateral Movement and Exfiltration techniques. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the exfiltration, so we need to find the tactic that leads to the collection of files.
   - Therefore, the Collection tactic is the most plausible choice as it involves the gathering of files of interest, which is the first step in the sequence leading to their exfiltration.
