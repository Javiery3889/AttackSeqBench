 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes Earth Lusca acquiring credentials and then scanning the compromised network environment. The TTPs mentioned are Mimikatz, ZeroLogon, HUC Port Banner Scanner, and fscan.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Credential Access (C) is the tactic used to steal or dump credentials, but it does not involve scanning the network environment.
   - Lateral Movement (A) is the tactic used to move within a network, but it does not necessarily involve scanning the network environment.
   - Resource Development (D) is not directly related to the actions described in the question.
   - Discovery (B) is the tactic used to identify resources in the network, which aligns best with the action of scanning the network environment with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - First, Earth Lusca used Credential Access techniques (Mimikatz, ZeroLogon) to acquire valid credentials.
   - After acquiring these credentials, they used Discovery techniques (HUC Port Banner Scanner, fscan) to identify resources in the compromised network environment. This Discovery phase helps them understand the layout of the network and find additional targets or valuable resources.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Credential Access -> Discovery.
