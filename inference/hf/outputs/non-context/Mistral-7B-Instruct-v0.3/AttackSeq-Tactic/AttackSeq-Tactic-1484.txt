 To answer this question, let's break it down:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs related to the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The malware first gathered local network information and then sent data to servers.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Credential Access (A) is typically used to steal or dump credentials, which doesn't seem to follow the sequence described.
   - Initial Access (D) is the first step in an attack, so it's unlikely to occur after the malware has already infiltrated the network.
   - Lateral Movement (C) is a step that involves moving within a network, which could potentially follow the gathering of local network information.
   - Command and Control (B) is the step where the malware communicates with its command and control servers, which seems to follow the sending data to servers part of the sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is: Gathering local network information (by using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API) -> Sending data to servers.
   - The TTP "Sending data to servers" aligns best with the "Command and Control" tactic, as it involves communication with external entities (servers).

Final Answer: B: Command and Control.
