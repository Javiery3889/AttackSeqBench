 Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious file (System.doc) was executed (TONEDEAF) to establish communication with a C2 server. Then, an anomaly was detected and prevented by FireEye's ExploitGuard in Microsoft Excel.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Persistence (A) typically involves actions taken by an attacker to ensure their presence and access to a system after the initial compromise. In this case, the question does not provide any information about persistence tactics before the Microsoft Excel detection.
   - Reconnaissance (B) refers to the gathering of information about a target before an attack. In this case, the malicious file executed to establish communication with the C2 server could be part of the reconnaissance phase, as the attacker might need to gather more information about the system before launching an attack in Microsoft Excel.
   - Impact (C) usually involves actions taken to cause damage or disrupt the target system. The question does not provide any information about impact tactics before the Microsoft Excel detection.
   - Defense Evasion (D) is a tactic used to hide the presence of an attacker or their actions on a system. While the malicious file might have been designed to evade detection, the question does not provide any information about defense evasion tactics before the Microsoft Excel detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the execution of a malicious file (System.doc) to establish communication with a C2 server (TONEDEAF). This action could be part of the reconnaissance phase, as the attacker might need to gather more information about the system before launching an attack.
   - After the malicious file was executed, an anomaly was detected and prevented by FireEye's ExploitGuard in Microsoft Excel. This suggests that the attacker might have intended to launch an attack in Microsoft Excel, but the system's defense mechanisms prevented it.
   - Given the sequence of events, it is most likely that the reconnaissance phase occurred before the attack in Microsoft Excel, making answer choice B: Reconnaissance the most plausible sequence of TTPs.
