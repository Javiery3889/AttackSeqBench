 Final Answer: C: Exfiltration

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes SkinnyBoy collecting base64 encoded data from systeminfo, tasklist, and targeted directories using the CryptBinaryToStringA API. This action involves data gathering, which is a common TTP in exfiltration activities.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Command and Control (A) is typically associated with maintaining a connection with the C2 server and receiving commands, not sending data.
   - Privilege Escalation (B) is about gaining higher access levels within a system, not exfiltrating data.
   - Impact (D) is a tactic that aims to cause damage or disrupt the normal functioning of a system, not exfiltrating data.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the collection of data from various system sources, which is a common TTP in exfiltration activities.
   - The data is then transferred to a C2 server, which is another TTP associated with exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be data collection (Exfiltration) followed by data transfer (Exfiltration).

In conclusion, the most likely tactic that occurred to transfer the data to the C2 server is Exfiltration (Answer Choice C).
