 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes an attacker using disposable email services to evade detection by concealing C&C communications. This action is a form of Defense Evasion (T1036) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Command and Control (T1053) is the tactic that follows Defense Evasion in the attack sequence, as it involves establishing communication channels with the compromised system to control it.
   - Resource Development (T1078) is about gathering resources for future attacks, which is not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - Discovery (T1087) is about gathering information about the target environment, which is also not directly related to the described sequence of TTPs.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker used a disposable email service to evade detection, which is a form of Defense Evasion (T1036).
   - After evading detection, the next logical step would be to establish communication channels with the compromised system, which is Command and Control (T1053).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Defense Evasion (T1036) followed by Command and Control (T1053).
