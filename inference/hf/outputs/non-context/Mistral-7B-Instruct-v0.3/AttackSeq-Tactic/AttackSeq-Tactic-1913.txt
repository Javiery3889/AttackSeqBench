 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after NanHaiShu used techniques such as base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation to hide the decoy XLS and JScript file.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Reconnaissance (A) is about gathering information about the target before an attack. It doesn't directly follow the actions of obfuscating files.
   - Initial Access (B) is about gaining unauthorized access to a system. While obfuscation could be a method to bypass security measures, it doesn't necessarily lead to initial access.
   - Discovery (C) is about identifying valuable information within a compromised system. This could follow the obfuscation of files, as the attacker might need to discover the decoy files after they have been hidden.
   - Defense Evasion (D) is about the actions taken to avoid detection by the security solutions. While obfuscation can be a part of defense evasion, it's not the only tactic. In this case, obfuscation is a specific technique used to hide the decoy files, not a broad tactic of defense evasion.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The obfuscation techniques used by NanHaiShu are methods to hide the decoy files, making them less detectable. This suggests that the attacker has already gained access to the system (Initial Access) and is now trying to evade detection (Defense Evasion). However, Discovery (C) is the tactic that most logically follows the obfuscation of the files, as the attacker would need to discover the decoy files after they have been hidden. Therefore, the obfuscation techniques are part of the Discovery phase, not Defense Evasion.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
