 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes FastPOS employing keylogging and RAM scraping to steal sensitive information, specifically credit card data. The question then asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred to ensure the immediate transmission of stolen credit card data.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Collection (A) is the tactic used to gather data, which has already been done with keylogging and RAM scraping.
   - Discovery (B) is the tactic used to search for information or assets. It doesn't directly relate to the immediate transmission of stolen data.
   - Initial Access (D) is the tactic used to gain access to a system. Since FastPOS already has access, this tactic is not applicable.
   - Command and Control (C) is the tactic used to maintain persistence and communicate with the compromised system. This tactic is most likely to ensure the immediate transmission of stolen data, as it allows the attacker to send commands to the compromised system to transmit the data.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access: FastPOS gained access to the system.
   - Collection: FastPOS collected sensitive information (credit card data) using keylogging and RAM scraping.
   - Command and Control: FastPOS established a communication channel to transmit the stolen data immediately, focusing on cards with valid service codes.
