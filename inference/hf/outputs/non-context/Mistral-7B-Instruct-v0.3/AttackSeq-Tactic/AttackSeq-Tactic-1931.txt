 Final Answer: B: Exfiltration

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question mentions that Machete utilized standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control servers, which is a form of Command and Control (T1086). It also mentions the implementation of fallback channels for document exfiltration.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Credential Access (A) is about obtaining, modifying, or deleting credentials. While Machete may have used credentials for communication, the question specifically mentions document exfiltration, not credential access.
   - Defense Evasion (C) is about techniques that an adversary uses to avoid detection by security solutions. While Machete may have used defense evasion techniques, the question specifically mentions document exfiltration, not defense evasion.
   - Command and Control (T1086, mentioned in the question) is about establishing a connection back to the adversary's infrastructure. However, the question mentions that this has already been done, and it focuses on the subsequent action of document exfiltration.
   - Exfiltration (B) is about the removal of data from a compromised system. The question mentions the use of fallback channels for document exfiltration, which aligns best with this tactic.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Machete has already established a connection back to its command and control servers (T1086).
   - After this initial connection, it implemented fallback channels for document exfiltration. This suggests that the next logical step would be to exfiltrate the data, making Exfiltration (B) the most plausible tactic that followed.
