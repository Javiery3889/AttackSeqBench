 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Poison Ivy's network communications were encrypted and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Discovery (A) is about gathering information about the target environment. It doesn't directly involve encrypted network communications.
   - Command and Control (B) is about maintaining communication with the compromised system, which aligns well with encrypted network communications.
   - Defense Evasion (C) is about hiding the presence of the attacker or the malware, which doesn't directly involve encrypted network communications.
   - Persistence (D) is about ensuring the attacker can maintain access to the compromised system, which could be achieved by blending with normal SSL traffic to avoid detection, but it doesn't directly involve encrypted network communications.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question mentions that Poison Ivy's network communications were encrypted and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443. This action is more likely to be part of the Command and Control (B) tactic, as it allows the attacker to maintain communication with the compromised system in a way that is less likely to be detected.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control.
