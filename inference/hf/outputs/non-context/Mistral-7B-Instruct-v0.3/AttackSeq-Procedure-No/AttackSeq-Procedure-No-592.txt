 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the execution of the ISMAgent payload via a VBScript, which is a common TTP used by the OilRig threat group.
   - The question then mentions the potential abuse of Outlook Rules and the use of Ruler, another tool associated with OilRig.
   - Finally, the question mentions the Trojan communicating with its C2 server via HTTP requests and DNS tunneling, which are also common TTPs of OilRig.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that OilRig will abuse Outlook Rules using Ruler to establish persistence before the Trojan communicates with its C2 server via HTTP requests and DNS tunneling. This answer choice aligns best with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Answer choice B suggests that OilRig will not abuse Outlook Rules or use Ruler to establish persistence before communicating with its C2 server. This answer choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the execution of the ISMAgent payload, a known TTP of OilRig.
   - After the payload execution, it is likely that OilRig will establish persistence on the compromised system. One of the methods OilRig is known to use is abusing Outlook Rules with the Ruler tool.
   - Once persistence is established, the Trojan will communicate with its C2 server, and the question mentions that this communication will occur via HTTP requests and DNS tunneling, which are also known TTPs of OilRig.
   - Therefore, it is likely that OilRig will abuse Outlook Rules using Ruler to establish persistence before the Trojan communicates with its C2 server via HTTP requests and DNS tunneling.
