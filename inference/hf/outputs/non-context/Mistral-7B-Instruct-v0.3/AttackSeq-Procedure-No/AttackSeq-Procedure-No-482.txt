 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.
   - The question also mentions that FamousSparrow communicates with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol and employs multi-byte XOR keys for encrypted communications.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A: Yes aligns best with the attack sequence in the question. The question mentions that FamousSparrow communicates with the C&C server and employs encrypted communications, which is consistent with the use of multi-byte XOR keys. Additionally, the question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data every 10 minutes, which suggests a scheduled transfer method.
   - Answer choice B: No does not align with the attack sequence in the question. The question mentions that FamousSparrow communicates with the C&C server and employs encrypted communications, which is not consistent with not exfiltrating data.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FamousSparrow communicates with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol and multi-byte XOR keys for encrypted communications, and then exfiltrates data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method. The final answer is Yes.
