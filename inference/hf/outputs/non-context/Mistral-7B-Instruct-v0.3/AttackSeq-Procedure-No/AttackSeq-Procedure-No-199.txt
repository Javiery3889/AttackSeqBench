 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the GreyEnergy group in a cyber attack. The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
   - Compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini
   - Performing lateral movement across a compromised network
   - Mapping the network using Nmap
   - Collecting credentials using Mimikatz

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A suggests that the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools to perform lateral movement, then map the network and collect credentials. This sequence aligns with the attack sequence described in the question, as lateral movement is a common precursor to network mapping and credential collection.
   - Answer Choice B suggests that the GreyEnergy group will not use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools for lateral movement. However, these tools are commonly used by the GreyEnergy group for lateral movement, so it is unlikely that they would not use them in this scenario.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the initial compromise of a computer using GreyEnergy mini. This is the starting point of the attack sequence.
   - After compromising a computer, the attacker needs to move laterally across the network to infect other systems. The GreyEnergy group is known to use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for this purpose.
   - Once the attacker has moved laterally and gained access to multiple systems, they will want to map the network to understand its structure and identify potential targets. Nmap is a common tool used for network mapping.
   - Finally, the attacker will want to collect credentials to maintain persistence and move deeper into the network. Mimikatz is a popular tool for credential dumping.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - Compromise a computer using GreyEnergy mini
   - Perform lateral movement using SysInternals PsExec and WinExe
   - Map the network using Nmap
   - Collect credentials using Mimikatz

Final Answer: Yes.
