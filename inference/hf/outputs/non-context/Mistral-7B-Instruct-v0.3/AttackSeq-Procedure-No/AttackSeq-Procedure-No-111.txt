 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first install additional persistence points on new systems, then exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement. The question also mentions a discovery phase where attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence in the question. After installing persistence points, attackers would typically conduct a discovery phase to understand their target environment before moving laterally. This sequence allows them to plan their attack more effectively and potentially avoid detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attackers first install additional persistence points on new systems (Initial Access and Persistence TTPs).
   - After gaining a foothold, they conduct a discovery phase (Reconnaissance TTP) to gather information about the target environment, including systems, users, and data.
   - Once they have the necessary information, they exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement (Lateral Movement TTP). This sequence allows them to move through the network undetected or with minimal detection, as they have already gathered information about the target environment.
