 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group FIN13.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Passive backdoors (BLUEAGAVE)
     - Establishing a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports
     - Listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution
     - Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware
     - Establishing persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware after using other methods to establish persistence.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question do not suggest that FIN13 establishes persistence before exploiting external servers. Instead, they first use passive backdoors and establish a local HTTP server for command execution.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that FIN13 would first establish persistence using tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries before exploiting external servers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by FIN13, but the sequence does not suggest that they first establish persistence before exploiting external servers.
   - The TTPs suggest that FIN13 first uses passive backdoors (BLUEAGAVE) and establishes a local HTTP server for command execution.
   - It is more likely that FIN13 would first establish persistence using tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries before exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - Therefore, the answer is "No". FIN13 is not likely to exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware after using other methods to establish persistence.
