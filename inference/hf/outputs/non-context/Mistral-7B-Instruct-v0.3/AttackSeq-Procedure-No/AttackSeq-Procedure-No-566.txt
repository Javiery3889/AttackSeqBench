 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The MITRE ATT&CK technique T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) involves the attacker gaining access to a system through a compromised software update. However, this technique does not inherently involve the use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.
   - However, it is common for attackers to use multiple TTPs in a sequence to achieve their goals. One common sequence is to first gain access to a system using T1078 (Credential Dumping) or T1087 (Privilege Escalation) to obtain legitimate credentials, and then use these credentials to move laterally and perform actions such as T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise).
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs before the attackers used a compromised software update.
   - T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) involves gaining access to a system through a compromised software update.
   - To gain access to a system, attackers often use T1078 (Credential Dumping) or T1087 (Privilege Escalation) to obtain legitimate credentials.
   - Once they have legitimate credentials, they can use these credentials to log into external remote services (T1139).
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers used T1139 (Remote Services) before T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise).
