 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to a cyber attack. The TTPs mentioned are Discovery, Collection, and Exfiltration.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the target network or system. In this case, the callCam app collects extensive information from compromised devices during the Discovery phase.
   - The Collection phase involves gathering data from the target. ARP cache poisoning is a technique used to intercept and manipulate network traffic, which could be used to collect additional data during the Collection phase.
   - The Exfiltration phase involves sending the collected data to the attacker's Command and Control (C&C) server. The question mentions a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase, which could be used to obfuscate the data being sent to the C&C server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The callCam app collects information during the Discovery phase.
   - To further collect data, the attacker could use ARP cache poisoning during the Collection phase. This technique allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate network traffic, potentially collecting more data.
   - After collecting the data, the attacker could use a customized encoding routine during the Exfiltration phase to obfuscate the data before sending it to the C&C server.

Therefore, it is likely that the callCam app facilitates ARP cache poisoning during the Collection phase before sending the data to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase.
