 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the Sednit group delivering a Flash exploit to establish a victim's machine as a target. The question then asks if it is likely that the group will make and impersonate tokens for privilege escalation to gain persistence on the victim's machine.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists "Impersonate Privileged Entity" and "Privilege Escalation" as techniques used by the Sednit group. These techniques are often used to gain higher-level access to a system and maintain persistence on the victim's machine. Since the question mentions the delivery of a Flash exploit, which is a common initial step for the Sednit group, it is likely that they would follow up with privilege escalation and impersonation techniques to gain persistence on the victim's machine.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Sednit group has established a victim's machine as a target by delivering a Flash exploit.
   - To maintain persistence on the victim's machine, the group often uses techniques such as privilege escalation and impersonation.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the group will make and impersonate tokens for privilege escalation to gain persistence on the victim's machine.
