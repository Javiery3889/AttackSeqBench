 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of a NewPass implant, a loader library, decoding a configuration file, evading detection, downloading via FTP, and exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will initiate download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question does not provide a clear indication that the malware will download via FTP before exfiltrating data. In fact, the sequence suggests that the malware might first evade detection, then download configuration, and only after that, it might exfiltrate data using encrypted POST requests.
   - There is no mention of FTP in the sequence of TTPs after the malware has evaded detection and decoded the configuration file.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of a NewPass implant, a loader library, decoding a configuration file, evading detection, downloading via FTP, and exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.
   - The sequence of TTPs does not provide a clear indication that the malware will download via FTP before exfiltrating data.
   - The sequence suggests that the malware might first evade detection, then download configuration, and only after that, it might exfiltrate data using encrypted POST requests.
   - There is no mention of FTP in the sequence of TTPs after the malware has evaded detection and decoded the configuration file.

Therefore, it is not likely that the malware will initiate download via FTP before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.
