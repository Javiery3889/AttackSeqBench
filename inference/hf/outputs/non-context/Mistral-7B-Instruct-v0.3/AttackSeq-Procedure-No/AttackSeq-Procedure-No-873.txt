 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes downloading and executing a malware Dropper module, followed by the Stager module notifying of successful exploitation.
   - The question also mentions a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities exploitation and privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question does not explicitly state that the Stager module will only notify after exploiting the mentioned vulnerabilities and achieving privilege escalation.
   - The question only mentions the sequence of TTPs without specifying a causal relationship between the exploitation of the vulnerabilities and the Stager module notification.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes downloading and executing a malware Dropper module, but it does not specify that the Stager module will only notify after exploiting the mentioned vulnerabilities and achieving privilege escalation.
   - The question does not provide any information that suggests a causal relationship between the exploitation of the vulnerabilities and the Stager module notification.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the question, it is not plausible to conclude that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access and achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956. Therefore, the answer is "No".
