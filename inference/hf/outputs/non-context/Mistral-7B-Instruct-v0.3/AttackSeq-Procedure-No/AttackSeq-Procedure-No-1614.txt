 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts. However, the question does not mention any TTPs related to exfiltrating the collected email accounts over FTP to remote servers.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. However, there is no evidence in the question to support this claim.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the collected email accounts will not be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. This aligns better with the information provided in the question, as no TTPs related to FTP exfiltration were mentioned.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes an attacker accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts. This is a common TTP for initial access and discovery (Initial Access and Reconnaissance phases in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - However, the question does not provide any information about the next steps the attacker would take, such as exfiltrating the collected data. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say whether the email accounts will be exfiltrated or not.
   - However, the question does not mention any TTPs related to FTP exfiltration, so it is reasonable to assume that the collected email accounts will not be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. This is in line with answer choice B.
