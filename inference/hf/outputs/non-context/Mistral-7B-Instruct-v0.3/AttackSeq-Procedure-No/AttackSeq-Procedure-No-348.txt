 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to information gathering (System Information Discovery) and data exfiltration (Data from Victim).
   - The question does not mention any TTPs related to encrypting C2 data, converting it into a hexadecimal representation, or encoding it into base64.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the malware will perform a series of TTPs that were not mentioned in the question.
   - Answer choice B correctly states that the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include encrypting C2 data, converting it into a hexadecimal representation, or encoding it into base64.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs related to information gathering and data exfiltration, but it does not mention any TTPs related to encrypting, converting, or encoding C2 data.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the malware will encrypt C2 data, convert it into a hexadecimal representation, and then encode it into base64 before contacting the domain 'marina-info.net' for further operations.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
