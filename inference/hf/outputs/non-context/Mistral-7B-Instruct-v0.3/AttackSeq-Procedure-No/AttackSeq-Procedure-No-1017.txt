 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to the BlackEnergy Trojan. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Connecting to a hardcoded C&C server
   - Issuing an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information
   - Creating a LNK file in the system startup folder to execute "rundll32.exe" on every system boot

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the BlackEnergy Trojan will create a LNK file in the system startup folder to execute "rundll32.exe" on every system boot, which aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the BlackEnergy Trojan will not create a LNK file in the system startup folder, which contradicts the TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the BlackEnergy Trojan connecting to its C&C server and sending BASE64-encoded victim information. This is a common TTP for data exfiltration.
   - Creating a LNK file in the system startup folder to execute "rundll32.exe" on every system boot is a technique used by the BlackEnergy Trojan to ensure persistence, as it allows the malware to run automatically upon system startup.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will create a LNK file in the system startup folder to execute "rundll32.exe" on every system boot, making answer choice A the most plausible.
