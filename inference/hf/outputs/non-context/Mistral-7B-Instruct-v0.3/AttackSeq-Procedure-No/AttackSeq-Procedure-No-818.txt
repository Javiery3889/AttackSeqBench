 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer, a known malware, will use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication before it steals information from SNS applications and encrypts this data using AES.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists WinDealer's TTPs, which include Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Command and Control.
   - WinDealer is known to use various methods for Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, and Lateral Movement. However, it does not typically use FTP for Command and Control communication.
   - WinDealer is known to encrypt stolen data using AES, but this is usually done after it has stolen the information, not before.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that WinDealer would first perform Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, and Lateral Movement, and then steal information from SNS applications and encrypt it using AES, but not necessarily use FTP for C2 communication before these steps.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: WinDealer can gain access to a system through various methods such as phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.
   - Execution: Once it has gained access, WinDealer executes its malicious payload.
   - Persistence: WinDealer establishes persistence on the compromised system to ensure it remains on the system even after a reboot.
   - Privilege Escalation: WinDealer attempts to escalate its privileges to gain higher-level access to the system.
   - Defense Evasion: WinDealer takes steps to evade detection by antivirus software and other security measures.
   - Credential Access: WinDealer steals credentials to gain access to other systems.
   - Discovery: WinDealer discovers and maps the network to find other systems to target.
   - Lateral Movement: WinDealer moves laterally within the network to target other systems.
   - Data Theft: WinDealer steals sensitive data, such as from SNS applications.
   - Encryption: WinDealer encrypts the stolen data using AES to make it difficult to decipher.
   - Command and Control: WinDealer communicates with its C2 server to receive further instructions, but it does not typically use FTP for this communication.
