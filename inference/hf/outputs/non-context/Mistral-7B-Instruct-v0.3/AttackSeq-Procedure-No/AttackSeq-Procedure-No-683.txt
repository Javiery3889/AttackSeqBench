 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts, exploiting exposed Docker API ports for initial access, and then abusing command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence in the question does not mention the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.
   - If the attackers' ultimate objective was resource hijacking through malicious container images, they would likely perform actions such as uploading and executing malicious container images, not immediately moving on to cryptocurrency mining.
   - Cryptocurrency mining is often a secondary objective for attackers, used to generate revenue, and is not typically the primary goal in a resource hijacking attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts and exploiting exposed Docker API ports for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers are said to abuse command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
   - However, the question asks if this sequence of TTPs occurs after achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.
   - Since the sequence in the question does not include any actions related to resource hijacking through malicious container images, it is unlikely that the attackers would perform cryptocurrency mining only after achieving this objective.

Therefore, the answer is "No". The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not align with the attack sequence that includes the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images, followed by cryptocurrency mining.
