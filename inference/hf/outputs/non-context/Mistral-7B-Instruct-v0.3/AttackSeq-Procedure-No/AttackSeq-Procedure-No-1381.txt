 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor FIN13, which includes moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells, and gathering information on services.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are asking if FIN13 will gather information on services only after obtaining credentials. The question suggests that FIN13 has already moved laterally and gathered access to the system, so it is likely that they would use this access to gather information on services. The TTPs mentioned in the question, such as process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries, are techniques used to obtain credentials. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that FIN13 would use these techniques to obtain additional credentials, not just for gathering information on services.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN13 has already moved laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.
   - The question then asks if FIN13 will gather information on services. This implies that FIN13 has already gained access to the system and is now looking for more information.
   - The answer choices ask if FIN13 will gather information on services only after obtaining credentials. Since FIN13 has already moved laterally and gained access, it is likely that they would use this access to gather information on services.
   - However, the question also mentions that FIN13 might use techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries to obtain credentials. It is reasonable to assume that FIN13 would use these techniques to obtain additional credentials, not just for gathering information on services.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Move laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.
   - Obtain credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.
   - Gather information on services using system service discovery.
