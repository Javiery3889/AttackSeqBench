 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Get-NetComputer command from PowerView is a tool used for remote system discovery, which means it is used to gather information about systems on a network.
   - SocGholish is a framework used for initial compromise, meaning it is used to gain unauthorized access to a system.
   - It is plausible that an attacker would first use a tool like Get-NetComputer to discover potential targets, and then use a tool like SocGholish to exploit those targets.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Attackers use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView to discover systems on a network. This is a reconnaissance phase, where the attacker is gathering information about potential targets.
   - Step 2: Attackers use the SocGholish framework to compromise those discovered systems. This is the initial exploitation phase, where the attacker is exploiting the discovered systems to gain unauthorized access.

Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.
