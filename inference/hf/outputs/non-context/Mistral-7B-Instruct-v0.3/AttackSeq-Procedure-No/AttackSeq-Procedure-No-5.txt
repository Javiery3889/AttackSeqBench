 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to a spear phishing attack and the delivery of QuasarRAT via RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Option A suggests that the spear phishing emails containing RTF documents will only be received after the recipients have already been infected with QuasarRAT. However, this sequence is not plausible because the spear phishing email would be the initial infection vector, not a subsequent one.
   - Option B correctly states that the spear phishing email would come first, followed by the RTF document exploit. However, it does not necessarily imply that the recipients would be infected with QuasarRAT after getting infected with the RTF document exploit. The question does not provide information about the specific malware delivered by the RTF document, only that it is QuasarRAT.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a spear phishing attack where recipients are presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report. This is the initial TTP (Tactic: Hacking, Technique: Spear Phishing, Procedure: Use of malicious documents).
   - The RTF document exploiting CVE-2017-8750 is then mentioned, which is a technique used to deliver malware. This would be the next TTP (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: Exploit Public-Facing Application, Procedure: RTF Document Exploit).
   - The question does not provide information about the specific malware delivered by the RTF document, so it is not possible to definitively say that the recipients would be infected with QuasarRAT after getting infected with the RTF document exploit. However, it is clear that the spear phishing email and the RTF document exploit are separate TTPs that occur before any potential infection with QuasarRAT.
