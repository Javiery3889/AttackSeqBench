 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the initial execution of Poison Ivy malware through social engineering and mobile code delivery. Poison Ivy is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allows an attacker to control an infected system remotely.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the Command and Control (C2) phase, which is the stage where the attacker communicates with the compromised system. Google Drive is a cloud storage service provided by Google, and it's not typically used as a C2 channel for malware like Poison Ivy.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the use of Poison Ivy, a RAT that usually communicates with the attacker through a C2 server.
   - Google Drive is a cloud storage service, not a C2 server. It's not common for malware to use cloud storage services for C2 communications, as they are not designed for this purpose and have security measures in place to prevent such activities.
   - Therefore, it's unlikely that Google Drive would be used for C2 communications during the Command and Control phase of an attack involving Poison Ivy malware.

In conclusion, the answer is B: No. Google Drive is not likely to be used for Command and Control communications with the attacker's client during the Command and Control phase of an attack involving Poison Ivy malware.
