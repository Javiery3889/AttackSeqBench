 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving external communication for exfiltration, communication over HTTPS, and the use of a custom cryptographic protocol. However, it does not mention the configuration of a specific domain and IP address combination per target.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A suggests that Longhorn's malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This answer choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, as it includes an additional TTP (configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target) that is not present in the question.
   - Answer B suggests that Longhorn's malware will not configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This answer choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, as it only includes the TTPs that are explicitly stated in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is B: No.
