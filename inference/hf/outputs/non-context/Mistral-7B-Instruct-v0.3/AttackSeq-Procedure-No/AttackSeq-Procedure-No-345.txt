 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a malware using HTTPS communication for command and control operations. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A: Yes - This answer choice suggests that the malware will use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to discover system information and process lists. Since the malware is already using command and control operations, it is plausible that it could use additional commands to gather information about the compromised system.
   - Answer B: No - This answer choice suggests that the malware will not use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to discover system information and process lists. However, the question does not provide any information to suggest that the malware will not use this command, making this answer less likely.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware is using HTTPS communication for command and control operations, which is a common TTP for malware to communicate with its command and control server.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.
   - This command is a common method for malware to gather system information and process lists on a compromised system.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware will use this command to gather information about the compromised system.

In conclusion, the malware is likely to use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command to discover system information and process lists. Final Answer: A: Yes.
