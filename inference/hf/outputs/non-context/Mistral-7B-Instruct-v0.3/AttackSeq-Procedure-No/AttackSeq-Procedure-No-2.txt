 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Software discovery is a common TTP used by malware to gather information about the target system. Querying the registry for installed applications is a method used for software discovery.
   - Given that the malware has already achieved persistence and is evading detection, it is likely that the malware would want to gather more information about the system to further its objectives. Querying the registry for installed applications would provide valuable information for the malware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware has already achieved persistence and is evading detection, indicating that it is in a stealthy phase.
   - In this stealthy phase, the malware would want to gather as much information as possible about the target system to better understand its environment and plan its next steps.
   - Querying the registry for installed applications is a common TTP used by malware for software discovery, which would provide valuable information about the system's installed applications.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware will query the registry for installed applications as part of software discovery.
