 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving a custom screenshot tool (Harvester), a custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon), and Cobalt Strike Beacon. The question asks if it is likely that these tools will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not provide any information about the C2 communication method used by Backdoor.Graphon or Cobalt Strike Beacon. However, it is known that Cobalt Strike Beacon typically uses its own custom protocol for C2 communication, not FTP. Similarly, there is no information suggesting that Backdoor.Graphon uses FTP for C2 communication.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question does not provide any evidence that Backdoor.Graphon or Cobalt Strike Beacon use FTP for C2 communication.
   - Cobalt Strike Beacon is known to use its own custom protocol for C2 communication, not FTP.
   - Backdoor.Graphon is a custom malware, and without specific information about its C2 communication method, it is not reasonable to assume it uses FTP.

Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "No".
