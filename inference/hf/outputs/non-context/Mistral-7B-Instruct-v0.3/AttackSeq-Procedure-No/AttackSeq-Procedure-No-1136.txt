 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the WINDSHIFT APT, which includes gathering identifiable information through fake social media personas, and stealing contact lists, emails, and SMS contents using social media mobile apps. The question then asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will subsequently access external victim-owned websites for target development.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs described in the question are part of the Reconnaissance phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. Accessing external victim-owned websites is also a common TTP in the Reconnaissance phase, as it allows attackers to gather more information about their targets. Therefore, it is plausible that WINDSHIFT APT would perform this TTP after the initial reconnaissance activities described in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The initial TTPs described in the question involve gathering information through social media personas and mobile apps. These TTPs are part of the Reconnaissance phase, which is the first phase of an attack.
   - In the Reconnaissance phase, attackers gather as much information as possible about their targets to plan their attack. Accessing external victim-owned websites is a common TTP in this phase, as it allows attackers to gather more information about their targets.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that WINDSHIFT APT would perform this TTP after the initial reconnaissance activities described in the question, as it would help them further develop their targets for a potential attack.

4. Conclusion: Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the common TTPs used in the Reconnaissance phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will subsequently access external victim-owned websites for target development. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
