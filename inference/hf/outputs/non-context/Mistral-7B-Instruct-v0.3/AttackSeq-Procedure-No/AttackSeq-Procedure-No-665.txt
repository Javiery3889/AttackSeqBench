 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving Mimikatz, Impacket tools for pass-the-hash, and AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec for lateral movement. The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will perform permission groups discovery after these actions.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not involve any action related to permission groups discovery. The actions described are focused on credential access, lateral movement, and execution of commands.
   - The sequence of TTPs does not suggest that permission groups discovery would be performed after lateral movement. Typically, threat actors would perform discovery and reconnaissance activities before or during the initial access and credential access stages, not after lateral movement.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: Threat actors use Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - Credential Access: Threat actors employ Impacket tools to execute pass-the-hash.
   - Lateral Movement: Threat actors use AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec to move laterally within the network.
   - Command Execution: Threat actors run commands on the compromised systems.
   - Permission Groups Discovery: This activity is not part of the sequence described in the question and would typically be performed during the initial access or discovery phase.

Therefore, it is not likely that the threat actors will run commands to perform permission groups discovery only after moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.
