 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by AURORA PANDA, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
   - The sequence includes exploiting CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware, which is done through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organizationâ€™s website.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure before leveraging the exploit code again.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not mention the use of Sakula malware before leveraging the exploit code again. Instead, it mentions the use of ZxShell malware.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Sakula malware will be used to communicate with a C2 infrastructure before leveraging the exploit code again.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by AURORA PANDA, which includes exploiting CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware through SWC.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Sakula malware will be used before leveraging the exploit code again.
   - However, the question does not mention the use of Sakula malware after the initial exploitation with ZxShell malware.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Sakula malware will be used to communicate with a C2 infrastructure before leveraging the exploit code again.
   - Final Answer: No.
