 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Syrian Malware Team would use BlackWorm RAT for command and control before disabling Task Manager and killing analysis processes like Wireshark and MBAM.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     a. Disabling Task Manager
     b. Killing analysis processes like Wireshark and MBAM
     c. Using BlackWorm RAT for command and control by communicating to specific IP addresses and ports

   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that the malware team would first disable the tools used for monitoring and analysis (Task Manager, Wireshark, and MBAM) before using BlackWorm RAT for command and control.

   - Therefore, it is more likely that the malware team would disable the tools for monitoring and analysis before using BlackWorm RAT for command and control.

   - Answer A suggests that they would use BlackWorm RAT first, which contradicts the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

   - Answer B suggests that they would disable the tools for monitoring and analysis before using BlackWorm RAT for command and control, which aligns best with the attack sequence in the question.
