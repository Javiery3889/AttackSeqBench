 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the OceanLotus backdoor. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Initiating command and control communication
   - Using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The OceanLotus backdoor is known for its extensive data gathering capabilities, including the collection of system information and user details.
   - After establishing command and control communication, it is plausible for the backdoor to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information.
   - The use of a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode is a common method for secure communication, but it does not necessarily prevent the backdoor from gathering data.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initiating command and control communication: This is the first step where the backdoor establishes a connection with its server.
   - Using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode: This is a method used to secure the communication between the backdoor and its server.
   - Surveying the victim's computer to gather details: This is a common action taken by the OceanLotus backdoor after establishing communication to collect system and user information.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - Initiate command and control communication
   - Use a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode
   - Survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server.
