 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to the Discovery, Exfiltration, and Collection phases of an attack. The Discovery phase involves gathering information, the Exfiltration phase involves sending the collected data to a command and control (C&C) server, and the Collection phase involves encrypting the data.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if it is likely for the app to send the collected data to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase before encrypting it using RSA and AES encryption algorithms during the Collection phase. However, the sequence of TTPs in the question does not align with this scenario. Typically, data is encrypted before it is sent to a C&C server, not after.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - In the Discovery phase, the callCam app collects extensive information from compromised devices.
   - In the Exfiltration phase, the collected data is sent to the C&C server.
   - However, the Collection phase, as described in the question, involves encrypting the data using RSA and AES algorithms. This would typically happen before the data is sent to the C&C server, not after.

Therefore, it is not likely for the app to send the collected data to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase before encrypting it using RSA and AES encryption algorithms during the Collection phase.
