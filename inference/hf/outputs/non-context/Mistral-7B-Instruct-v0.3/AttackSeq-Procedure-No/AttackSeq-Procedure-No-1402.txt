 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to an attack by FIN13, a known cybercrime group. The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.
     - Using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for moving AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement.
     - Collecting data from network shared drives.
     - Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after using native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - FIN13 is known for using a variety of TTPs, but they are not typically associated with using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. They are more likely to use techniques such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute-forcing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or living off the land (using built-in tools and legitimate software for malicious purposes).
   - Using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement would be an unusual choice for FIN13, as it would require them to have legitimate access to the software and the network, which is not consistent with their typical modus operandi.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: FIN13 has initially used native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, which is a common TTP for initial access and discovery.
   - Step 2: After gaining a foothold, FIN13 would likely use techniques such as RDP brute-forcing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or living off the land to move laterally within the network.
   - Step 3: Once they have moved laterally, they would collect data from network shared drives and target specific information for fraudulent transactions.
   - Step 4: There is no evidence to suggest that FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement, as this would be an unusual choice for them.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for FIN13 in this scenario would not include the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement.
