 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) from the FHAPPI campaign, which includes delivering a phishing email, using a VBScript to download and open a .doc file, and leading to the execution of malware.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include any indication that the malware will use the cron utility for installation. Instead, it uses VBScript and a .doc file for execution.
   - PowerShell is a common tool used by malware for further execution, but there is no mention of it in the question after the initial execution of the malware.
   - Cron jobs are typically used in Unix-based systems, and it is less common for malware to use this method for persistence, especially when VBScript and PowerShell are already mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that includes VBScript and a .doc file for execution.
   - Malware often uses PowerShell for further execution after initial execution, but there is no mention of PowerShell after the initial execution in the question.
   - Cron jobs are typically used in Unix-based systems, and it is less common for malware to use this method for persistence, especially when VBScript and PowerShell are already mentioned in the question.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution.
