 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Mustang Panda. The sequence starts with phishing lures related to official European Union and Ukrainian government reports for initial access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists SSH tunneling under the "Command and Control" tactic. This technique allows an attacker to create a secure connection between their system and the compromised system, enabling them to exfiltrate data or issue commands without being detected.
   - Stagers and shellcode download are listed under the "Execution" tactic. These techniques involve downloading and executing malicious code on the compromised system to further the attacker's objectives.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After gaining initial access, Mustang Panda would typically establish a command and control channel to maintain persistence and issue commands on the compromised system. SSH tunneling is a common technique used for this purpose.
   - Once they have a secure connection, it is likely that they would download and execute additional malware (stagers and shellcode) to further their objectives, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement.

Therefore, it is plausible that Mustang Panda would use SSH tunneling during command and control before employing stagers to download additional shellcode for execution.
