 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes initial access (phishing), execution (COM object), information gathering (queries), and lateral movement/command and control (download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware).
   - Answer choice A: Yes, aligns best with the attack sequence in the question as it suggests that a COM object will execute queries and download payloads, which are the next logical steps after initial access.
   - Answer choice B: No, does not align with the attack sequence in the question as it suggests that no further actions will be taken after initial access, which is not plausible in a real-world attack scenario.
