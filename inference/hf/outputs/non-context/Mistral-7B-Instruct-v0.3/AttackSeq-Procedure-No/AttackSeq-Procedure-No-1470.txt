 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that includes reconnaissance activities, gathering publicly available information, active discovery methods, and the installation of malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 through employee-enabled macro execution.
   - The question asks if it is likely that these implants will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - BlackEnergy 3 is a known malware family that primarily uses Windows-based payloads, not Ruby scripts. According to MITRE ATT&CK, BlackEnergy 3 is associated with tactics such as Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Command and Control. It does not have a specific technique for using Ruby scripts to execute payloads.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - First, the attacker gathers publicly available information and conducts active discovery methods to learn about the target network and systems.
   - Next, the attacker gains initial access to the network, often through phishing emails with malicious attachments that exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office applications, such as Word or Excel. This is where employee-enabled macro execution comes in.
   - Once inside the network, the attacker installs malware like BlackEnergy 3. However, as mentioned earlier, BlackEnergy 3 does not typically use Ruby scripts to execute payloads. Instead, it uses Windows-based payloads.

Therefore, it is not likely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.
