 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving communication with C2 servers, using encrypted and base64-encoded commands, and a custom base64 alphabet.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - TTPs mentioned in the question suggest that the malware has already established a connection with C2 servers, which is often a precursor to further malicious activities.
   - One of the common TTPs associated with TDrop2 malware is the collection of system and network information, also known as Discovery in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information after communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that suggest the malware has established a connection with C2 servers.
   - TDrop2 malware is known for performing discovery activities to collect system and network information.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information after communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
