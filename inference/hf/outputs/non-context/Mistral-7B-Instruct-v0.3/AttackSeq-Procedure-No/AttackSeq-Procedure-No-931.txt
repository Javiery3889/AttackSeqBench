 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to Darkhotel APT's activities, which includes targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access, and potentially deploying malware components such as downloaders, stealers, or advanced keyloggers during execution. The question then asks if it is likely that Darkhotel APT will use sophisticated defense evasion techniques like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files only after deploying malware components.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not suggest that Darkhotel APT would wait to use defense evasion techniques after deploying malware components. In fact, the sequence of TTPs does not necessarily imply a specific order for the use of these techniques. However, it is more common for APTs to use defense evasion techniques earlier in the attack chain, such as during the initial access or execution phases, to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes Darkhotel APT's initial TTPs, which involve targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access. This is typically an initial access or reconnaissance phase.
   - The question then mentions the potential deployment of malware components such as downloaders, stealers, or advanced keyloggers during execution. This is a common tactic used by APTs to maintain persistence and gather more information.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Darkhotel APT will use defense evasion techniques like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files only after deploying malware components. However, the sequence of TTPs does not suggest that this is a likely sequence of events.
   - It is more likely that Darkhotel APT would use defense evasion techniques earlier in the attack chain, such as during the initial access or execution phases, to maintain persistence and avoid detection. For example, they might use techniques like using legitimate tools, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using social engineering to gain initial access, and then use defense evasion techniques to maintain access and avoid detection.

Therefore, the answer is "No". Darkhotel APT is not likely to use sophisticated defense evasion techniques like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files only after deploying malware components during execution.
