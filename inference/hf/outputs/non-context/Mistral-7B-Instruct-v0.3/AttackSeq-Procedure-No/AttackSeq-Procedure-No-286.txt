 To answer this question, we need to understand the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involved in the attack sequence and how they relate to the answer choices.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that Elfin established command and control using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.
   - The question then asks if it's likely that they exfiltrated data over Google Drive.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - POSHC2 and Quasar RAT are remote access tools, not typically associated with data exfiltration over Google Drive.
   - While it's possible that an attacker could use Google Drive as a data storage or command and control location, there's no direct evidence in the provided TTPs that suggest this is the case.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The TTPs mentioned (POSHC2 and Quasar RAT) are primarily used for establishing command and control and remote access, not data exfiltration over Google Drive.
   - While it's theoretically possible that an attacker could use Google Drive for data storage or command and control, the provided TTPs do not suggest this is the case.

Final Answer: No.
