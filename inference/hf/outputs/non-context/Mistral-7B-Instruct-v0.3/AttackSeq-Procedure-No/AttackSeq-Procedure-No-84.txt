 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the likelihood of Vyveva dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic, given that files were previously compressed with zlib during the Collection tactic.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information suggesting that Vyveva divides files during the Exfiltration phase specifically. The question only mentions the Collection tactic, where files were compressed with zlib. There is no evidence or indication that Vyveve would divide files during the Exfiltration phase based on their size.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks about the Exfiltration tactic, but the provided answer choices do not specify this tactic.
   - The question mentions that files were compressed with zlib during the Collection tactic, but there is no information suggesting that Vyveva divides files during the Exfiltration phase.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that Vyveva does not divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic.

Final Answer: B: No.
