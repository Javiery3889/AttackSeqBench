 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) related to the WastedLocker ransomware attack. The TTPs mentioned are Defense Evasion (using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender) and Impact (deleting system volume shadow copies).

2. Compare and Evaluate: The Defense Evasion technique is used to bypass security measures, making it easier for the attacker to execute their malicious actions. In this case, disabling Windows Defender allows the ransomware to operate without interference. The Impact phase is when the attacker causes damage or disruption to the system. Deleting system volume shadow copies can prevent the victim from recovering their data, which aligns with the typical impact of ransomware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies after deploying and disabling Windows Defender.
   - Deploying the ransomware and disabling Windows Defender (Defense Evasion) is a common tactic to ensure the ransomware can execute its malicious actions without being detected or stopped.
   - Deleting system volume shadow copies (Impact) is a common action taken by ransomware to prevent the victim from recovering their data, making it more difficult for the victim to restore their system to its previous state without paying the ransom.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies after deploying and disabling Windows Defender.
