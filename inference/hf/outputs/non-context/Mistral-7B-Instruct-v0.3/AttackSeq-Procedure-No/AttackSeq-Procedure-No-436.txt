 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to drop an HTA file. The question then asks if this HTA file will communicate with Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for Command and Control before executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not provide any information about the HTA file communicating with any cloud storage services (Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive) for Command and Control before executing the FinalBot backdoor.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include any steps that would indicate communication with cloud storage services for Command and Control.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the sequence of TTPs as follows:
     - Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to drop an HTA file.
     - No mention of communication with cloud storage services for Command and Control.
     - Potential execution of the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is not plausible that the HTA file would communicate with Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for Command and Control before executing the FinalBot backdoor.

Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
