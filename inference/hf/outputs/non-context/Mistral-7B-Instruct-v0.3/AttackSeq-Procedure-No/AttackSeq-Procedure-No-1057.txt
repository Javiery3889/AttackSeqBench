 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the execution of an obfuscated batch script, the execution of a PowerShell script (myScript.ps1), and the establishment of command and control by njRAT.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Persistence is a common tactic used by threat actors to maintain access to compromised systems. In this case, after gaining initial access and establishing command and control, it is likely that the attacker would perform actions to maintain persistence on the victim's computer.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker has already gained initial access to the system through the execution of the obfuscated batch script and myScript.ps1.
   - Establishing command and control (C2) over the victim's computer allows the attacker to issue commands and receive data from the compromised system.
   - To ensure continued access, the attacker would typically perform actions to maintain persistence, such as creating a scheduled task, modifying the system's registry, or injecting malware into legitimate processes.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the common tactics used by threat actors, it is likely that actions to maintain persistence will be performed after the initial access and C2 establishment. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
