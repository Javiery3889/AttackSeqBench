 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the GreyEnergy group, which includes compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini, using Nmap and Mimikatz, and collecting credentials.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network. PDQ Deploy is a remote software deployment tool, and while it can be used for malicious purposes, there is no known association between the GreyEnergy group and the use of PDQ Deploy for this purpose. The GreyEnergy group is known to use tools like PowerShell for lateral movement and payload delivery.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The GreyEnergy group has been observed using GreyEnergy mini to compromise a computer.
   - They then use Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.
   - However, there is no evidence to suggest that the GreyEnergy group uses PDQ Deploy for moving AvosLocker or other tools across the network. The group is known to use PowerShell for lateral movement and payload delivery. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of PDQ Deploy.
