 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the TTPs used by the Rising Sun implant, which includes initial reconnaissance, communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding. However, it does not mention any TTPs related to GitHub.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any evidence or indication that the Rising Sun implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration. The TTPs described in the question do not align with known TTPs used by threat actors for data exfiltration via GitHub.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance and communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding. These TTPs are common for initial access and command and control (C2) communication, but not for data exfiltration.
   - Data exfiltration via GitHub typically involves creating a repository, pushing data to the repository, and using Git commands to hide the data among legitimate code commits. The TTPs described in the question do not align with these common TTPs for data exfiltration via GitHub.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the Rising Sun implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration based on the TTPs described in the question.
