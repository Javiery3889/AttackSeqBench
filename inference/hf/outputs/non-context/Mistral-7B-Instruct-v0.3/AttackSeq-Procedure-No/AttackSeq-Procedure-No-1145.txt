 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the discovery of outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters. This information could be used by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to these systems.

2. Compare and Evaluate: Shodan and Censys are search engines that allow users to find specific types of devices connected to the internet. They are often used by cybercriminals to discover publicly available resources, including outdated or unsecured devices. Given that the question mentions outdated devices, it is likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover more of these devices in other medical organizations.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Cybercriminals have discovered outdated devices in the medical networks' perimeters.
   - These devices are likely to be publicly accessible due to their outdated nature and the use of the MQTT protocol, which is known to have security vulnerabilities.
   - To find more of these devices in other medical organizations, cybercriminals would likely use search engines like Shodan and Censys, which are designed to find publicly accessible devices.
   - Therefore, it is likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations.
