 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to RIG EK's command and control operations, which includes using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The use of an encrypted channel is a common technique to hide malicious activities, making it harder for security solutions to detect them. One way to further obfuscate these activities is by using proxy servers, as they can mask the true origin of the traffic. Therefore, it is plausible that RIG EK's infrastructure might use proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that RIG EK uses an encrypted channel for command and control operations, which is a technique to hide malicious activities.
   - Using proxy servers is another technique to further obfuscate these activities, making it harder for security solutions to detect them.
   - Since RIG EK has already taken steps to hide its activities by using an encrypted channel, it is likely that they would also use proxy servers to further enhance their evasion capabilities.
   - Therefore, the answer choice A: Yes, is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question.
