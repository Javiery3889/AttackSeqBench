 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Dexphot, after using fileless techniques for defense evasion, is likely to use process hollowing during the execution stage.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Dexphot is known to use fileless techniques for defense evasion, which means it avoids using traditional files for its malicious activities. This makes it harder for security solutions to detect the malware.
   - Process hollowing is a technique used by malware to load executables into legitimate system processes, which can help evade detection as the malicious code is hidden within a legitimate process.
   - Given that Dexphot is already using techniques to evade detection, it is plausible that it would also use process hollowing to further obfuscate its activities during the execution stage.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Dexphot uses fileless techniques for defense evasion to avoid detection (Step 1).
   - Process hollowing is a technique used to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage, which can help evade detection (Step 2).
   - Since Dexphot is already using techniques to evade detection, it is likely to use process hollowing to further obfuscate its activities during the execution stage (Step 3).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Defense Evasion (Fileless Techniques)
   - Execution (Process Hollowing)
