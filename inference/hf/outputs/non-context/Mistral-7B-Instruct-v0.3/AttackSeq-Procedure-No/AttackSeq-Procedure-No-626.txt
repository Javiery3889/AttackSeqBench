 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The CostaRicto Campaign is known to use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for communication with C2 servers. The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor, which is part of the CostaRicto Campaign, will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign has already been established to use HTTP and DNS for communication, which are not considered non-C2 protocols.
   - If the CostaRicto Campaign were to use HTTPS or SMTPS for data exfiltration, it would still be using a C2-related protocol, as HTTPS is an encrypted version of HTTP and SMTPS is a secure version of SMTP, both of which are commonly used in C2 communication.
   - Using a non-C2 protocol for data exfiltration would be an unusual choice, as it would deviate from the established TTPs of the CostaRicto Campaign.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign has been observed using DNS and HTTP for communication with C2 servers.
   - Data exfiltration is a common activity in a cyber attack, and it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor, being part of the CostaRicto Campaign, would use a method consistent with the campaign's TTPs.
   - Using HTTPS or SMTPS for data exfiltration would still be using a C2-related protocol, as they are secure versions of HTTP and SMTP, respectively.
   - Using a non-C2 protocol for data exfiltration would be an unusual choice, as it would deviate from the established TTPs of the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
