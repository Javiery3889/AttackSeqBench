 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used in a phishing attack. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade security systems.
   - Gathering account credentials.
   - Using a keylogger plugin.
   - Verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Using images instead of text in phishing emails is a technique to bypass security systems that rely on text analysis.
   - Gathering account credentials can be done in several ways, including using a keylogger plugin. This tool can capture keystrokes, including passwords, without the need for real-time verification.
   - Verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code is a more active approach and may not be necessary if the attacker has already obtained the password through a keylogger.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The attacker sends a phishing email with images to bypass security systems.
   - Step 2: The victim clicks on the malicious link in the email, downloading a keylogger plugin without realizing.
   - Step 3: The keylogger captures the victim's password when they enter it on a legitimate login page.
   - Step 4: The attacker gains access to the victim's account without the need for real-time verification or prompting for the 2-step verification code.

Therefore, it is more likely that the attackers will gather account credentials via a keylogger plugin instead of verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code.
