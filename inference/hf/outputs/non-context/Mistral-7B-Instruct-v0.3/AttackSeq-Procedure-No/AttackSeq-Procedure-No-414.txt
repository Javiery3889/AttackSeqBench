 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs in two different phases - Discovery and Lateral Movement. The TTPs mentioned in the Discovery phase are the use of reconnaissance tools within custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation. The question then asks about TTPs in the Lateral Movement phase, specifically the abuse of OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts and moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The Discovery phase TTPs (use of reconnaissance tools, internal scanning, and network exploitation) do not directly relate to the Lateral Movement phase TTPs (abuse of OAuth access tokens and RDP). While it is possible for an attacker to perform these actions in different phases, the question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs in the Lateral Movement phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Discovery phase TTPs (use of reconnaissance tools, internal scanning, and network exploitation) are used to gather information about the target network and identify vulnerabilities.
   - The Lateral Movement phase TTPs (abuse of OAuth access tokens and RDP) are used to move within the compromised network and gain access to additional systems.
   - In the given sequence, the Discovery phase TTPs do not logically lead to the Lateral Movement phase TTPs as described in the question. Therefore, the answer is "No".
