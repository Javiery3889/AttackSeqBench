 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance during the Discovery phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase is focused on gathering information about the target network and systems. Abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token is more associated with the Lateral Movement phase, where an attacker moves from one compromised system to another within the network.
   - However, the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not indicate any action that would lead to the compromise of an AD FS server or the acquisition of SAML tokens.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes TG1021 using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance during the Discovery phase. These tools are typically used to gather information about the target network, such as user accounts, group memberships, and system configurations.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase. However, the sequence of TTPs described does not suggest any action that would lead to the compromise of an AD FS server or the acquisition of SAML tokens.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
