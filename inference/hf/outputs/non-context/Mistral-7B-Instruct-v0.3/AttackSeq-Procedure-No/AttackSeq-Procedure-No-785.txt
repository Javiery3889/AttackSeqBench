 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Using an LNK file to initiate multi-stage commands
     - Executing a JavaScript file as part of the attack's execution phase
     - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence
     - Adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question does not provide a clear indication that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - It is possible that the Higaisa APT group could perform these actions in a different order or even separately.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The TTPs do not provide a clear indication that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the JavaScript file will perform a specific action (copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory) only after another action (adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks) has been performed.
   - However, the sequence of TTPs does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between these two actions.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
