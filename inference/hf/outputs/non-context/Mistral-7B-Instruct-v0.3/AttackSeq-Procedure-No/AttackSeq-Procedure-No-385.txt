 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15, including deploying backdoors, bypassing command prompt policy settings, and using RoyalCLI.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that APT15 has already gained a foothold in the network (by deploying backdoors and bypassing command prompt policy settings) and is using RoyalCLI for further actions.
   - Mimikatz is a tool often used to extract credentials from the memory of Windows systems, which would allow APT15 to obtain domain administrator credentials.
   - Stealing a VPN certificate would enable APT15 to access the network remotely, which aligns with the goal of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group like APT15.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not rule out the use of Mimikatz and stealing a VPN certificate, so it is plausible that these TTPs were used.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - APT15 has deployed backdoors and bypassed command prompt policy settings, indicating they have gained initial access to the network.
   - Using RoyalCLI for further actions suggests that APT15 is looking to escalate their privileges or move laterally within the network.
   - Mimikatz is a tool that can be used to extract credentials from the memory of Windows systems, which would allow APT15 to obtain domain administrator credentials.
   - Stealing a VPN certificate would enable APT15 to access the network remotely, which aligns with the goal of an APT group like APT15.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
