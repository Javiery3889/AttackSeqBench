 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of Seaduke malware, which is known for retrieving detailed bot/system information and self-deleting. However, it does not mention any TTPs related to calculating the command-and-control (C2) port using a specific method involving IP address octets.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are either "Yes" or "No". The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include any indication that Seaduke calculates the C2 port in the manner described in the question. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "No".

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the use of Seaduke malware, which is known for retrieving detailed system information and self-deleting.
   - The question does not provide any evidence or context suggesting that Seaduke calculates the C2 port using the method described in the answer choices.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that Seaduke would calculate the C2 port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value.

Final Answer: B: No.
