 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to a cyber attack campaign. The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by DDOS C2 servers.
     - Wiping processes on the target system.
     - Potential reboot of the target system.
     - Potential Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.
     - Potential 'total failure' of Next Media's network.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that attackers rebooted the target system after the wiping processes were complete instead of launching DDoS attacks.
   - The use of single-byte XOR keys and the wiping processes are not directly related to rebooting the system or launching DDoS attacks.
   - However, the sequence of TTPs that makes the most sense is:
     - Use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files.
     - Wiping processes on the target system (to erase traces of the attack).
     - Rebooting the target system (to ensure the wiped system starts fresh).
     - Potential DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong (as a part of the attack campaign).
     - Potential 'total failure' of Next Media's network (as a result of the DDoS attacks).
   - Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "No", as rebooting the system is not a likely action after the DDoS attacks.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if attackers rebooted the system after the wiping processes were complete.
   - The sequence of TTPs suggests that the wiping processes are followed by a reboot of the system.
   - However, the question also mentions the potential DDoS attacks and 'total failure' of Next Media's network, which are not related to rebooting the system.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that the attackers launched DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure', rather than rebooting the target system.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
