 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where a macro downloads malicious payloads from a C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure. This is an initial access technique.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The next logical step in this attack sequence would be to gain further control over the victim's system to execute the malicious payload effectively. Disabling security controls would allow the attacker to move laterally within the network, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence without being detected. Embedding malicious MS Office documents in phishing emails is a common initial access technique, so it makes sense that the attacker would instruct victims to disable security controls after gaining initial access.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: The macro downloads malicious payloads from the threat actor's C2 infrastructure.
   - Initial Access (Phishing): The malicious payload was embedded in a phishing email to trick the victim into opening the document and enabling the macro.
   - Gaining Further Control: After gaining initial access, the attacker would want to disable security controls to maintain persistence and move laterally within the network.

Therefore, it is likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls only after gaining initial access by embedding malicious MS Office documents in phishing emails.
