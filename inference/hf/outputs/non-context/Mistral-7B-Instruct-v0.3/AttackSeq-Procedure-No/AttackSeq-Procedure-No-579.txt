 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker gains initial access by downloading and executing a script from a domain mapped by the sslip.io service and leveraging BADHATCH to execute commands in CMD or POWERSHELL mode.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will conduct domain trust discovery using tools such as nltest.exe and ping.exe before performing system owner/user discovery by issuing commands like whoami.exe.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question suggests that the attacker has gained access to a system and is executing commands.
   - To further escalate their privileges and move laterally within the network, it is common for attackers to perform domain trust discovery to identify other systems they can access. This can be done using tools like nltest.exe and ping.exe.
   - After discovering the domain structure, attackers often perform system owner/user discovery to understand their current context and potentially find higher-privileged accounts. This can be done using commands like whoami.exe.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will conduct domain trust discovery before performing system owner/user discovery.
