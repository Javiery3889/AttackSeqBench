 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that involve spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links, followed by Microsoft Word sending a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Freakyshelly attackers are known to use spear phishing emails as an initial access vector, often using malicious documents to trick victims into opening them. OLE2 format documents are a common choice for such attacks.
   - After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to perform reconnaissance to gather information about the target environment. Microsoft Word, when opening a document, may send information about the installed software to remote servers, which could be used for this purpose.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Freakyshelly attackers send spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links.
   - Step 2: Victims are tricked into opening the malicious documents, granting the attackers initial access.
   - Step 3: The attackers perform reconnaissance by having Microsoft Word send a GET request to their servers, providing information about the installed software on the victim's machine.

Given this sequence of TTPs, it is plausible that the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents in spear phishing emails before using a technique in which Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
