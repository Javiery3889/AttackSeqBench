 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files during the Collection phase. It does not mention any TTPs related to the Exfiltration phase, specifically exfiltrating data to a C2 server every 10 minutes.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are either "Yes" or "No". Since the question does not provide any information about the Exfiltration phase, it is not likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs related to the Collection phase, but not the Exfiltration phase.
   - The question does not provide any information about the malware exfiltrating data to a C2 server every 10 minutes.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes.
