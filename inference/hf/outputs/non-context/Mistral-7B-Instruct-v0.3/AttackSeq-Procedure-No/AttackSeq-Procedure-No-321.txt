 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the app uploading files via FTP, followed by sending the gathered information via HTTP.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the app sends the information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device. However, the question does not specify any routines on the iOS device before sending the information via HTTP.
   - Answer choice B correctly states that the app does not necessarily send the information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device. The question only mentions the FTP upload and does not imply any specific sequence of TTPs after the FTP upload.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the app uploading files via FTP.
   - The question does not specify any routines on the iOS device before sending the information via HTTP.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the app sends the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.

Final Answer: B: No.
