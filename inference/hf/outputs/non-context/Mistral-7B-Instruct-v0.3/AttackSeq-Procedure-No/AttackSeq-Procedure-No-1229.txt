 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the Lazarus group deploying Hermes ransomware and encrypting files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm.
   - It also mentions the presence of ransom notes in encrypted directories.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group established command and control communication by utilizing backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question describes the Lazarus group deploying ransomware, which is a common tactic used by threat actors to encrypt files and demand ransom.
   - Establishing command and control communication is a common technique used by threat actors to maintain control over compromised systems and execute further malicious activities.
   - Backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) is a type of malware that provides unauthorized access to a system, which can be used for command and control communication.
   - Given that the Lazarus group is known for using multiple stages of malware in their attacks, it is plausible that they would use backdoor malware to maintain control over the compromised systems after deploying the ransomware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files and left ransom notes, indicating that they have compromised a system and encrypted the files for ransom.
   - Establishing command and control communication is a common technique used by threat actors to maintain control over compromised systems and execute further malicious activities.
   - Backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) is a type of malware that provides unauthorized access to a system, which can be used for command and control communication.
   - Given that the Lazarus group is known for using multiple stages of malware in their attacks, it is plausible that they would use backdoor malware to maintain control over the compromised systems after deploying the ransomware.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Lazarus group established command and control communication by utilizing backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
