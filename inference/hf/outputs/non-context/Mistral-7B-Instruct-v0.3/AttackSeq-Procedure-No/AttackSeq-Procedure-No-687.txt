 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tools, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers for Initial Access and Reconnaissance.
   - For Initial Access, the TTPs mentioned are AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat.
   - For Reconnaissance, the TTPs mentioned are Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that attackers will employ Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package for Initial Access after using tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 for Reconnaissance.
   - However, the TTPs mentioned for Initial Access (AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat) are different from the TTPs mentioned for Reconnaissance.
   - Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC are more likely to be used for Initial Access or Post-Exploitation, not Reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that attackers will use these TTPs for Initial Access only after using tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 for Reconnaissance.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs for Initial Access and Reconnaissance.
   - The TTPs for Initial Access are AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat, which are different from the TTPs for Reconnaissance (Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3).
   - Therefore, it is not likely that attackers will employ Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package for Initial Access only after using tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 for Reconnaissance.
   - Final Answer: No.
