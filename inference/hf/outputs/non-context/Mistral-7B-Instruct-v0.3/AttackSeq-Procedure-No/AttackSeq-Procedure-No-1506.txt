 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes RIG EK's use of proxy servers within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect. This indicates an initial step to evade detection.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists domain fronting as a technique under the "Command and Control" category (T1036). This technique is often used to disguise the destination of network traffic, making it appear as if it's going to another server hosted in the same Content Delivery Network (CDN). Given that RIG EK is trying to make its operations harder to detect, it is plausible that they would use domain fronting for their command and control operations.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect (Initial Evasion).
   - To further evade detection, it is likely that RIG EK would use additional techniques to disguise its command and control operations.
   - Domain fronting is a technique that can be used to disguise the destination of network traffic, making it appear as if it's going to another server hosted in the same CDN.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that RIG EK would use domain fronting for its command and control operations after using proxy servers for initial evasion.
