 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that client software vulnerabilities, such as Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158, will be exploited for execution instead of malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper being executed.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The initial access was gained through Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities, not Microsoft Word. Therefore, it is less likely that the attacker would immediately switch to exploiting a different Microsoft Word vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) for execution.
   - It is more plausible that the attacker would continue using the already-exploited Equation Editor vulnerability to download and execute the malicious dropper, as this is the sequence of TTPs they have already initiated.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: Tropic Trooper exploits Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - Delivery: The attacker downloads and installs an MSI package.
   - Execution: It is more likely that the attacker will execute the malicious dropper from the MSI package, rather than switching to exploit a different client software vulnerability (Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158) for execution.

Therefore, the answer is B: No.
