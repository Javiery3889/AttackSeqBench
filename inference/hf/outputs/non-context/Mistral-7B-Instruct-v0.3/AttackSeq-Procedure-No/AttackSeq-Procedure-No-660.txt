 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of Mimikatz for credential dumping, Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks, and lateral movement using the atexec tool. However, it does not mention the deployment of BlackEnergy's network sniffer module.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include the use of BlackEnergy's network sniffer module. Therefore, it is unlikely that the threat actors would deploy this module after the actions already described.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that involves credential dumping, pass-the-hash attacks, and lateral movement using the atexec tool.
   - BlackEnergy's network sniffer module is a tool used for network traffic analysis and discovery of user credentials being sent over the network.
   - Since the question does not mention the use of this module, it is unlikely that the threat actors would deploy it after the actions already described, as it would not be necessary to discover credentials already obtained through Mimikatz.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the deployment of BlackEnergy's network sniffer module.
