 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors use AtomBombing for malicious code injection and execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the threat actors may use a VBA script as part of their strategy, such as embedding it within a malicious Word document. This could be a plausible next step, as VBA scripts can be used to execute malicious code within Microsoft Office applications, which includes Word.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the threat actors will not use a VBA script. However, given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is not unlikely for threat actors to use multiple techniques for code execution, and VBA scripting is a common method for malicious actors to exploit Microsoft Office applications.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Threat actors have already used AtomBombing for malicious code injection and execution. This technique is often used to bypass security controls and execute malicious code within the context of a legitimate process.
   - Using a VBA script within a malicious Word document is another technique that threat actors can use to execute malicious code. This technique can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office applications, such as the infamous "Macro Viruses".
   - Therefore, it is plausible that threat actors may use a VBA script as part of their strategy after using AtomBombing, as it allows them to further evade detection and execute malicious code within a legitimate application.
