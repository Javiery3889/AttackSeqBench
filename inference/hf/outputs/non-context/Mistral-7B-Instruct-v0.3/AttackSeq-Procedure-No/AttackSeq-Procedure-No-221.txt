 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an IRC channel is used for Command and Control (C&C) communication, and the question asks if a Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A suggests that the Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host. This is plausible because Shellbots are often designed to perform reconnaissance on the compromised system to gain more control and understanding of the environment.
   - Answer Choice B suggests that the Shellbot is not likely to gather information about the infected host. This is less plausible because Shellbots are designed to be versatile and often include reconnaissance capabilities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a Shellbot gathering information about the infected host.
   - A Shellbot, once it has established C&C communication, may perform various tasks, including reconnaissance to better understand the compromised system.
   - Gathering information such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions are installed can help the attacker in further exploitation and maintaining persistence on the compromised system.
   - Therefore, it is likely that a Shellbot will gather information about the infected host.
