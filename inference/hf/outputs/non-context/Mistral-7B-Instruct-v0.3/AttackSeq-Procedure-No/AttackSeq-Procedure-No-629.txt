 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs related to the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT malware, which includes defense evasion techniques such as process injection and deobfuscation, followed by the collection of data related to the SombRAT backdoor.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question does not provide any information about the malware archiving collected data or using a custom storage file format before employing process discovery and system time discovery capabilities. However, these two capabilities (process discovery and system time discovery) are typically used for reconnaissance purposes, not for data archiving.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions the use of defense evasion techniques and data collection, but does not provide any information about data archiving or the use of a custom storage file format.
   - Process discovery and system time discovery are reconnaissance techniques used to gather information about the target system, not for data archiving.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT malware will archive collected data using a custom storage file format before employing its process discovery and system time discovery capabilities.
