 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the deployment of njRAT malware for credential harvesting, followed by the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases.
   - The question also mentions SideCopy as a potential tool for exfiltration and suggests a specific infection chain involving malicious LNK files and a convoluted delivery method.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not provide any information that directly links SideCopy to the specific infection chain mentioned (malicious LNK files and a convoluted delivery method).
   - While it is possible that SideCopy could be used for exfiltration after gaining initial access through other means, the question does not provide evidence to support the claim that SideCopy is only used in this specific, convoluted infection chain.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the deployment of njRAT malware for credential harvesting. This is the initial step in the attack.
   - The question then mentions the possibility of SideCopy being used for exfiltration. However, it does not provide any evidence to suggest that SideCopy is only used after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
   - Therefore, it is not plausible to conclude that SideCopy is only used in this specific, convoluted infection chain.

In conclusion, the answer is B: No, SideCopy is not likely to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices only after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
