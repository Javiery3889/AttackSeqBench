 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) related to the Nemesis bootkit's persistence and potential evasion of detection. The question specifically asks if it is likely that the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR), which is a low-level boot sector of a hard disk. This technique does not involve placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.
   - Evasion techniques such as fileless malware, steganography, or using excluded directories are usually employed after the initial infection to avoid detection. However, the question does not mention any of these techniques following the initial persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.
   - The Nemesis bootkit infects the VBR, which is not a directory where files are stored. Therefore, it is not likely for the malware to place install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.
   - The question does not mention any other evasion techniques following the initial persistence, which further supports the conclusion that it is not likely for the malware to evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.
