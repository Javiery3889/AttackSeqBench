 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) related to a cyber attack. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Credential Access (using web session cookies)
   - Cloud Resource Access (implied by the use of web session cookies)
   - Credential Hopping
   - Malware Configuration (TrailBlazer for WMI persistence)
   - Stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.
   - However, the question does not provide any information that suggests a direct link between credential hopping, malware configuration, and stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations.
   - The initial TTP mentioned is the use of web session cookies for cloud resource access, which is not directly related to the subsequent TTPs of credential hopping and malware configuration.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs related to a cyber attack.
   - The initial TTP is the use of web session cookies for cloud resource access.
   - There is no information provided that suggests a direct link between this initial TTP and the subsequent TTPs of credential hopping and malware configuration.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.
