 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the target system, but it does not necessarily imply the use of specific tools or infrastructure for C2 communication.
   - While it is possible for an attacker to use blogs or WordPress for C2 purposes, there is no evidence in the question that suggests this is the case for the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor.
   - The question does not mention any TTPs related to setting up C2 infrastructure using blogs or WordPress, so it is not the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery, which are typical TTPs during the Discovery phase of an attack.
   - These TTPs do not inherently imply the use of blogs or WordPress for C2 infrastructure.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2, but there is no evidence in the question to support this.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure.
