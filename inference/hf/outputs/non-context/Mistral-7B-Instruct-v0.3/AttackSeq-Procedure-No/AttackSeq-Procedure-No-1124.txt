 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (TTP: Exploitation of CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - The question then mentions the download of a Flash file (show.swf) and a GIF image, which likely contain the payload.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Flash file will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question does not include any TTPs related to downgrading NTLM or capturing NTLM hashes.
   - The sequence of TTPs suggests that the attacker first gains initial access through the Adobe Flash exploit, then downloads the Flash file and GIF image, and finally installs the payload.
   - There is no mention of downgrading NTLM or capturing NTLM hashes in this sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with a spear-phishing attack using a malicious Adobe Flash exploit.
   - This is followed by the download of a Flash file and a GIF image, which likely contain the payload.
   - However, there is no mention of any TTPs related to downgrading NTLM or capturing NTLM hashes in this sequence.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the Flash file will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.
