 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a campaign involving phishing emails and a malicious Microsoft Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the VBS macros will be executed after gaining initial access through phishing emails, which aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the VBS macros will not be executed before gaining initial access, which contradicts the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The phishing email is the initial access point for the attacker.
   - The attacker sends a malicious Microsoft Word document (Richard_Johnson.doc) through the phishing email.
   - The victim opens the document, which contains VBS macros.
   - The VBS macros are executed, potentially leading to further compromise.

Therefore, it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only after gaining initial access through phishing emails.
