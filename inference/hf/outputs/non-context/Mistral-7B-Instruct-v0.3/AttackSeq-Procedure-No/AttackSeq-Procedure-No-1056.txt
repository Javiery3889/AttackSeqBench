 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving phishing attacks, gaining initial access, and targeting news organizations. The attacker is then said to be employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The TTP of clearing logs from specific directories (/var/logs and /Library/logs) is a common technique used by threat actors to cover their tracks and evade detection. This TTP is often employed after gaining initial access to a system. Since the question mentions that the attacker has already gained initial access, it is likely that they would want to clear logs to avoid detection before moving on to the next steps, which include runtime packers and obfuscation techniques.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker has gained initial access to the target system through phishing attacks and targeting news organizations.
   - To avoid detection, the attacker would want to clear logs from the system.
   - Clearing logs from /var/logs and /Library/logs is a common TTP used to cover tracks.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attacker will clear logs before employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.
