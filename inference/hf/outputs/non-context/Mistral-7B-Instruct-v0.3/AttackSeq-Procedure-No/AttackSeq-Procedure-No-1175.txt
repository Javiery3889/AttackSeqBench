 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving spear-phishing emails (Reconnaissance tactic), Taidoor malware beaconing, and exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Taidoor malware will execute beaconing communications before exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - Beaconing is a technique used by malware to communicate with its command and control (C2) server, often for further instructions or data exfiltration.
   - Taidoor malware is known to use beaconing communications, as mentioned in various CTI reports.
   - After gaining a foothold in the system through spear-phishing, it is common for malware to establish communication with its C2 server before proceeding with further actions, such as exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to drop the malware onto the target's system is a subsequent action that typically follows the beaconing phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - It is likely that the Taidoor malware will execute beaconing communications using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern before exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to drop itself onto the target's system. This sequence aligns with the common tactics, techniques, and procedures used by malware in a cyber attack.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
