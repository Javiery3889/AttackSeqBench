 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the use of InstallUtil.exe for Defense Evasion, which is a technique used to bypass security controls such as Smartscreen and AppLocker. The question then asks if the malware is likely to create a scheduled task with appropriate privileges to ensure persistence.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The use of InstallUtil.exe is often employed to bypass security controls, but it does not inherently create a scheduled task for persistence. However, creating a scheduled task is a common technique for persistence in an attack sequence. Therefore, it is plausible that after bypassing security controls, the malware would create a scheduled task to ensure its continued operation on the compromised system.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware first uses InstallUtil.exe to bypass security controls (Defense Evasion).
   - After successfully bypassing these controls, the malware creates a scheduled task with appropriate privileges to ensure its persistence on the compromised system. This scheduled task would be set to run at system startup or at specific intervals, allowing the malware to continue its operations even if the initial point of entry is discovered and closed.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario would be: Defense Evasion (using InstallUtil.exe) followed by Persistence (creating a scheduled task). The final answer is "Yes".
