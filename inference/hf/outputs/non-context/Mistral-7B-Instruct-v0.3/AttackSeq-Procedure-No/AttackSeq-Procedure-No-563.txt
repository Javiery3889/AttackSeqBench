 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs: T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, T1071 Application Layer Protocol, and T1057 Process Discovery.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1553 Subvert Trust Controls is used to evade defenses, and T1071 Application Layer Protocol is used for command and control over compromised infrastructure.
   - After establishing command and control, it is plausible that threat actors would want to gain more knowledge about the systems and internal networks of the compromised organizations. This is where T1057 Process Discovery comes in, as it is used to gather information about running processes on a compromised system.
   - Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question (T1553, T1071, T1057) seems logical and plausible.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - T1553 Subvert Trust Controls is used to bypass security controls, allowing the attacker to move freely within the system.
   - T1071 Application Layer Protocol is then used to establish a command and control channel, allowing the attacker to issue commands to the compromised system.
   - After having a stable command and control channel, it is likely that the attacker would want to gather more information about the compromised system and internal networks to plan further actions. This is where T1057 Process Discovery comes in, as it allows the attacker to discover running processes, which can provide valuable information about the system's configuration and installed software.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes, it is likely that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery for gaining knowledge about the systems and internal networks of the compromised organizations only after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.
