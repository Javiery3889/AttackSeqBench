 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before collecting system information and probing files.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Phishing (email), Initial Access (via stolen application access tokens), Discovery (collecting system information and probing files).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that FamousSparrow will first steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links, then move on to the Discovery phase (collecting system information and probing files). This sequence aligns with the attack sequence mentioned in the question.
   - Answer choice B suggests that FamousSparrow will not steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before the Discovery phase. This sequence does not align with the attack sequence mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by FamousSparrow.
   - Phishing is a common initial access vector used by threat actors to gain access to a system. In this case, FamousSparrow is using phishing emails containing malicious links to steal application access tokens.
   - Once the threat actor has stolen the application access tokens, they can use these tokens to access the targeted application and perform actions on behalf of the user.
   - After gaining initial access, the threat actor will likely move on to the Discovery phase, where they collect system information and probe files to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
   - Therefore, it is likely that FamousSparrow will steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before collecting system information and probing files.
