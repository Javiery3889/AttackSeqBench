 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that RIG EK, a known malware family that delivers various types of malware, creates system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - RIG EK is primarily known for delivering various types of malware, including adware, ransomware, and cryptocurrency miners. However, it does not typically create system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software as a first step.
   - RIG EK usually delivers its payload through exploit kits, which often involve obfuscated PowerShell scripts to download and execute the malware.
   - Creating system services and executing cryptocurrency mining software would be a more complex and time-consuming process, which is not typically the first step in a RIG EK attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - RIG EK typically delivers its payload through exploit kits, which involve obfuscated PowerShell scripts to download and execute the malware.
   - Creating system services and executing cryptocurrency mining software is a more complex and time-consuming process, which is not typically the first step in a RIG EK attack.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that RIG EK would first run an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter, and then potentially execute cryptocurrency mining software or other malware, but not necessarily create system services as a first step.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided and the typical behavior of RIG EK, it is more likely that RIG EK would first run an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter, and not create system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software before this step. Therefore, the answer is "No".
