 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) involving the use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads, followed by the dropping of RegAsm.exe and injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that Tropic Trooper is likely to drop RegAsm.exe and then inject a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, which aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - Answer choice B suggests that Tropic Trooper is not likely to perform these actions, which contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. This is a technique often used by Tropic Trooper in the initial stages of an attack to gain access to a system.
   - After gaining access, Tropic Trooper is likely to drop RegAsm.exe, a legitimate Microsoft tool, onto the system for performing malicious activity. This is a common technique used by Tropic Trooper to maintain persistence and execute further commands.
   - Finally, Tropic Trooper is likely to inject a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to facilitate their attack. This is another common technique used by Tropic Trooper to maintain access to the system and execute commands covertly.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - Use Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
   - Drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity.
   - Inject a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to facilitate their attack.

And the final answer is: A: Yes.
