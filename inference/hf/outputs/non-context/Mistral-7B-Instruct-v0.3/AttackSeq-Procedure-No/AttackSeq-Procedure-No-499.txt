 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that includes using a UAC bypass module, executing the main payload with elevated privileges, downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site, and using batch files in a multi-step process.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not specify that the malware infection method uses batch files in a multi-step process after downloading the base64-encoded CAB file. In fact, the sequence of TTPs suggests that the UAC bypass and payload execution occur before the CAB file download. Therefore, it is less likely that the malware infection method would involve a multi-step process with batch files after the CAB file download.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware first uses a UAC bypass module to gain elevated privileges.
   - Then, it executes the main payload with these elevated privileges.
   - Afterward, it downloads a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site.
   - The question does not provide evidence that a multi-step process involving batch files occurs after the CAB file download.

Therefore, it is less likely that the malware infection method will use batch files in a multi-step process only after downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document.
