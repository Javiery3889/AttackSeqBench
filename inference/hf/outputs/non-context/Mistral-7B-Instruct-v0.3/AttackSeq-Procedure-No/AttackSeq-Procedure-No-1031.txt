 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used for lateral movement within a network, specifically the use of direct shell commands, Cobalt Strike features like psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, and ssh. The question then asks if it is likely that attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question is typical for an attacker to establish a foothold within a network and move laterally to other systems. Once an attacker has gained access to a system, they would likely want to gather more information about the network and Active Directory to further their attack. ADFind is a tool used for searching Active Directory, and port scanning is a common technique for gathering network information. Therefore, it is plausible that an attacker would use these tools after the initial lateral movement.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After gaining access to a system within the network, attackers often use lateral movement techniques to move from one system to another. In this case, the attacker used direct shell commands, Cobalt Strike features, and other remote execution tools to propagate beacons to other systems.
   - Once an attacker has moved laterally, they would want to gather more information about the network and Active Directory to further their attack. This is part of the discovery process.
   - ADFind is a tool used for searching Active Directory, and port scanning is a common technique for gathering network information. Therefore, it is plausible that an attacker would use these tools after the initial lateral movement.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
