 To answer this question, let's first identify the TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Initial Access (exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802)
2. Command and Control (presumably, since a backdoor installer is mentioned)
3. Initial Creation (implied, since a system configuration file is dropped)
4. Defense Evasion (not explicitly mentioned, but a backdoor installer could be used for this purpose)
5. Discovery (not explicitly mentioned, but the attacker needs to discover the system to perform the attack)
6. Lateral Movement (not explicitly mentioned, but a backdoor could be used for this purpose)
7. Collection (not explicitly mentioned, but the attacker might collect information after installing the backdoor)
8. Exfiltration (not explicitly mentioned, but the attacker might exfiltrate data after collecting it)
9. Persistence (implied, since a backdoor is installed)
10. Command and Control (implied, since a backdoor is installed)

Now, let's compare and evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
- The question mentions that a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) was dropped, which suggests that the attacker has established persistence and command and control over the system. However, the question does not explicitly state that social media channels were used for spearphishing before the backdoor installer was dropped.

B: No
- The question does mention the use of a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which implies that some form of social engineering or initial access was used to gain entry into the system. While it's not explicitly stated that social media channels were used for spearphishing, it's not impossible or unlikely either.

Since the question does not provide enough information to definitively say that social media channels were not used for spearphishing, the most plausible answer is B: No. However, it's important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and further investigation would be needed to confirm this.

Final Answer: B: No.
