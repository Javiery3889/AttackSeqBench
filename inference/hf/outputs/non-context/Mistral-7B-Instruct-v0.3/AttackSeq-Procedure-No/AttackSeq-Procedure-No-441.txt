 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a backdoor configuration with an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address.
   - The question then asks if API hooking techniques are likely to be used to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - API hooking is a technique used by malware to intercept and modify the behavior of system calls, making it difficult for security solutions to detect the malicious activity.
   - Modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' functions in memory can help the malware to open processes and manipulate network connections without raising suspicion, which aligns with the goal of evading detection.
   - The backdoor configuration with encryption and XOR-encrypted C&C server address does not necessarily imply the use of API hooking, but it is a common technique used in conjunction with such configurations to maintain stealth.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The backdoor configuration includes an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address, which suggests that the malware is designed to communicate securely with its command and control server.
   - To maintain stealth and evade detection, the malware may use API hooking techniques to intercept and modify system calls related to process management (ZwOpenProcess) and network connections (GetExtendedTcpTable).
   - By hooking these functions, the malware can open processes and manipulate network connections without raising alarms, making it more difficult for security solutions to detect its activity.

Therefore, it is likely that API hooking techniques will be used to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.
