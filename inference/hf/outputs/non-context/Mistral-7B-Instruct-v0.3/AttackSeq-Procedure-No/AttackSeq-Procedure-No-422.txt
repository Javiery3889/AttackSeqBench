 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that a campaign involving phishing emails will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) mentioned in the question are:
     - Tactic: Initial Access (Phishing)
     - Tactic: Initial Access (Exploit)
     - Target: FortiOS devices
     - Specific Exploit: CVE-2018-13379

   - The answer choices are:
     - A: Yes
     - B: No

   - The sequence of TTPs in the question does not include an Initial Access through an exploit of CVE-2018-13379 on FortiOS devices immediately after a phishing attack. The phishing attack provides initial access, but the exploit of CVE-2018-13379 is a separate step that requires additional actions, such as gaining a foothold and lateral movement within the network.

   - Therefore, it is not likely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices immediately after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The attacker sends a phishing email containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
   - Step 2: The victim opens the malicious document, allowing the attacker to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - Step 3: The attacker may perform further actions, such as gaining a foothold and lateral movement within the network, before attempting to exploit CVE-2018-13379 on FortiOS devices.
   - Step 4: If the attacker finds FortiOS devices on the network, they may attempt to exploit CVE-2018-13379 to gain deeper access to the network. However, this sequence of events does not occur immediately after the initial phishing attack.

   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is not likely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. Therefore, the correct answer is B: No.
