 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server. This is an initial reconnaissance and communication phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists "Use External Proxy" as a technique under the "Command and Control" category. This technique involves using compromised systems to relay command traffic, which can help maintain Command and Control by making it harder to trace the attacker's activities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The initial TTPs mentioned in the question (collecting system information and sending it to the C2 server) are part of the Reconnaissance and Initial Access phases in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - After establishing initial access and reconnaissance, an attacker may move to the Command and Control phase, where they would seek to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
   - Using external proxies is a technique that can be employed during the Command and Control phase to maintain persistence and make it harder to trace the attacker's activities.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that POWERSHOWER, after collecting system information and sending it to the C2 server, would use external proxy techniques as part of maintaining Command and Control.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access: Collect system information and send it to the C2 server (POWERSHOWER)
   - Command and Control: Use external proxy techniques (compromising residential endpoints to relay command traffic) to maintain Command and Control.
