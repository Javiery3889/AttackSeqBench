 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the execution of encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute payloads from URLs. This is an initial stage of an attack, often used for initial access or execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The FHAPPI campaign is known for using fileless techniques to avoid detection. Fileless techniques are often employed after initial access to the system to maintain persistence and perform further actions without leaving traces on the system. In this case, it is plausible that after establishing a connection with the C2 server (Command and Control server), the attacker would utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the initial stage of the attack, which involves executing encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute payloads from URLs. This is a common TTP for initial access or execution.
   - After initial access, it is common for attackers to establish a connection with a C2 server to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - The FHAPPI campaign is known for using fileless techniques to avoid detection. These techniques are often employed after initial access to the system to maintain persistence and perform further actions without leaving traces on the system.
   - Therefore, it is likely that after establishing a connection with the C2 server, the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection.
