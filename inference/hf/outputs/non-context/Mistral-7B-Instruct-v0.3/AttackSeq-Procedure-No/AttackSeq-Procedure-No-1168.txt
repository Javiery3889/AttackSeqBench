 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where the ProjectM actors first conduct reconnaissance, then collect location information, and finally execute Trojans.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. After conducting reconnaissance, it is plausible that the actors would collect location information from their phishing site visitors before moving on to executing Trojans.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This answer choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. If the actors did not collect location information, it would not be plausible for them to execute Trojans next.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is: Reconnaissance -> Collect Location Information -> Execute Trojans. The answer that best aligns with this sequence is Answer Choice A: Yes.
