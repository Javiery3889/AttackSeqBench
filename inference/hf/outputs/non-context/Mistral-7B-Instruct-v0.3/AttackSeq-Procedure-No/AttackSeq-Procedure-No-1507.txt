 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A: Yes aligns best with the attack sequence described in the question. RIG EK is a malware family known for delivering exploits through malvertising. It often uses obfuscated PowerShell scripts to download and execute malware. So, it is likely that RIG EK would first redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites and then run an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The user is lured to a compromised website or an advertising page due to malvertising.
   - Step 2: The compromised website or advertising page contains an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - Step 3: The PowerShell script is executed, which acts as a downloader for the malware.
   - Step 4: The malware is downloaded and executed on the victim's system.

Therefore, it is likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.
