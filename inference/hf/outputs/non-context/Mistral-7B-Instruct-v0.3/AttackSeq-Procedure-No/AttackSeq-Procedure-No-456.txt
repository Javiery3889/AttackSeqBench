 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes an attack sequence where APT-TOCS gained initial access using "powershell.exe" and executed Shellcode scripts for remote control. The core step of the attack is then described as evading defenses by running a credential harvesting tool in memory.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A suggests that PowerShell scripts were utilized to run a credential harvesting tool in memory. This aligns with the attack sequence described in the question, as it follows the initial access and evasion of defenses.
   - Answer B suggests that Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory during the core step. However, the question does not mention any further Shellcode script execution after the initial access, making this less likely.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: APT-TOCS gained access using "powershell.exe".
   - Core Step: The attacker evaded defenses by running a credential harvesting tool in memory.
   - Based on the sequence of events and the need for the attacker to evade defenses, it is more likely that PowerShell scripts were utilized to run the credential harvesting tool in memory, as suggested by answer A.
