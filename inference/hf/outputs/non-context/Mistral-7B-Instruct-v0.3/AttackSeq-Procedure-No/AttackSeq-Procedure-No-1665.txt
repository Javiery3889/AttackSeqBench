 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Trojanized installation executables via spear-phishing emails for initial access, discovery activities, and execution using process hollowing).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A: Yes aligns with the sequence described in the question. After initial access, it is common for malware to gather system information and network views (discovery activities) to understand the environment better before executing its main function (process hollowing).
   - Answer B: No does not align with the sequence described in the question, as it suggests that discovery activities would not occur before process hollowing, which is not plausible in this context.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: The attacker gains access to the system through spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.
   - Discovery Activities: The malware (TDrop2) gathers system information and network views to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - Execution: The malware performs execution using process hollowing to evade detection by creating a new process and replacing its code with the malicious payload.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access (spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables) -> Discovery Activities (gathering system information and network views) -> Execution (process hollowing). The answer is A: Yes.
