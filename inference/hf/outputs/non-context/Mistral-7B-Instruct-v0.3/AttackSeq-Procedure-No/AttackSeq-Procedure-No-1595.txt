 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker (Rocket Kitten) establishes communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server and then either downloads malware or monitors the victim's communications.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if Rocket Kitten will employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under Credential Access. The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the attacker has already gained a foothold in the victim's system through the C&C server. Employing a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under Credential Access is a common tactic used by threat actors to escalate their privileges and move laterally within a network.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attacker (Rocket Kitten) has established communication with a C&C server, which is often used to download malware or monitor the victim's communications.
   - After gaining a foothold in the victim's system, it is common for threat actors to employ additional TTPs to escalate their privileges and move laterally within a network.
   - One such TTP is the use of a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under Credential Access. This allows the attacker to potentially access sensitive information, such as passwords, and move laterally within the network.

Therefore, based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is plausible that Rocket Kitten will employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under Credential Access.
