 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the downloader retrieving an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase. The question then asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not provide any information about PowerShell scripts downloading a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase. The question only mentions the download of an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include the download of a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with the download of an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase.
   - The question does not provide any information about PowerShell scripts downloading a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that PowerShell scripts will download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase based on the information provided in the question.
