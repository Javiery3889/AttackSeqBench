 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 (a known advanced persistent threat group) will retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and then gather information on network and host configurations.
   - The TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question are:
     - Retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager (a cloud-based secrets management service)
     - Gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer choice aligns with the attack sequence in the question, as it suggests that FIN13 will first retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and then gather information on network and host configurations.
   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer choice contradicts the attack sequence in the question, as it suggests that FIN13 will not retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager before gathering information on network and host configurations.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: FIN13 retrieves secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using the enum_secrets module (a tool known to be used by FIN13 for enumerating secrets in cloud environments).
   - Step 2: FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance. This is a common TTP for initial reconnaissance in an attack.

Given the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question and the known behavior of FIN13, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
   - Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance

Therefore, the final answer is: Yes (Answer Choice A).
