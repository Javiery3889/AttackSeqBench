 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to Charming Kitten's activities, which includes impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate: To gather targeted individuals' e-mail addresses, Charming Kitten could have used various methods, including open source research and website contact forms. These methods are typically associated with the Reconnaissance phase, where an attacker gathers information about the target before launching an attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that Charming Kitten created fake websites to obtain credentials. This action is part of the Resource Development phase, where attackers prepare the tools and resources needed for the attack.
   - To target specific individuals, Charming Kitten would need to know their e-mail addresses.
   - Gathering e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms is a common TTP associated with the Reconnaissance phase, where an attacker collects information about the target before launching an attack.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Charming Kitten gathered targeted individuals' e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase.
