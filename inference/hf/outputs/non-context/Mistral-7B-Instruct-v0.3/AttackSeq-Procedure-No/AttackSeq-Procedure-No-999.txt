 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The TTPs mentioned are:
     - System Fingerprinting and Exfiltration (Collection)
     - Longhorn Malware (Initial Access, Command and Control, Defense Evasion, Execution, Persistence, Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration)
     - Wipe-on-Use and In-memory string de-obfuscation (Defense Evasion)
     - System Information Discovery (Discovery)

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if Longhorn is likely to perform System Information Discovery as part of its Discovery operations only after employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion.
   - However, the sequence of TTPs in the question does not suggest that Longhorn performs system information discovery after wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation. Instead, it suggests that Longhorn uses these tactics for defense evasion after system fingerprinting and exfiltration, and then uses its malware for various purposes, including system information discovery.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs as follows:
     - System Fingerprinting and Exfiltration (Collection)
     - Longhorn Malware (Initial Access, Command and Control, Defense Evasion, Execution, Persistence, Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration)
     - Wipe-on-Use and In-memory string de-obfuscation (Defense Evasion)
     - System Information Discovery (Discovery)
   - The sequence in the question does not suggest that Longhorn performs system information discovery after wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation. Instead, it suggests that Longhorn uses these tactics for defense evasion after system fingerprinting and exfiltration, and then uses its malware for various purposes, including system information discovery. Therefore, Longhorn is not likely to perform system information discovery only after employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion.
