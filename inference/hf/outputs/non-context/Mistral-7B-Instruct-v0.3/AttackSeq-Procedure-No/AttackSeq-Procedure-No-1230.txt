 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question and the possible subsequent TTPs that could follow based on the known activities of the Lazarus group.

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that the Lazarus group established command and control communication using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6).
   - The question then asks if it's likely that they engaged in double-extortion ransomware, exfiltrating files and then encrypting them to prompt victims to pay a ransom.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Lazarus group is known for various malicious activities, including cyber espionage, data theft, and financial theft. They have been linked to several high-profile attacks, such as the WannaCry and Sony Pictures attacks.
   - While the Lazarus group has been known to use ransomware in some attacks, their primary focus is typically data theft and financial gain. Double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating data before encrypting it, is a tactic more commonly associated with ransomware groups like REvil or Maze.
   - However, it's not impossible for the Lazarus group to adapt their tactics to include double-extortion ransomware, given their history of evolving their attack methods.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Given the TTPs mentioned in the question, the Lazarus group has established command and control communication, which is a common precursor to various types of attacks, including ransomware.
   - However, the question specifically asks about double-extortion ransomware, a tactic that is less commonly associated with the Lazarus group. While it's not impossible for them to use this tactic, it's more likely that they would focus on data theft or financial gain rather than double-extortion ransomware.

Final Answer: B: No. It is not likely that the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware after establishing command and control communication.
