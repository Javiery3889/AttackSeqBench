 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Mustang Panda, after using the double extension trick in a spearphishing campaign, is likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The double extension trick is a method used to evade defenses by disguising a malicious file as a harmless one. This technique is often used in the initial stages of an attack to gain access to a system. A reverse SOCKS proxy, on the other hand, is a tool used for anonymity and secure remote access. While it can be used in the later stages of an attack for command and control (C2) communication, it is not directly related to the double extension trick.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The double extension trick is a method used to evade defenses and gain initial access to a system.
   - A reverse SOCKS proxy is a tool used for anonymity and secure remote access, often in the later stages of an attack for C2 communication.
   - The question asks about Mustang Panda's behavior after using the double extension trick.
   - Since the double extension trick is an initial access technique, it is less likely that Mustang Panda would immediately switch to using a reverse SOCKS proxy. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would not include the use of a reverse SOCKS proxy immediately after the double extension trick.

Therefore, the answer is B: No, Mustang Panda is not likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy immediately after utilizing the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaign.
