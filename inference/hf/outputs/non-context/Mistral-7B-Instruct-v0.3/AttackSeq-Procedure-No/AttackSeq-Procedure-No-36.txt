 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) where the malware (Machete) has already enumerated running processes and gathered browser data such as bookmarks and stored credentials.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Option A: Yes - This answer choice aligns well with the attack sequence in the question. After gathering local credentials, it is a common TTP for malware to deploy a network sniffer module to capture user credentials being sent over the network. This would allow the malware to capture credentials for services that are not stored locally but are sent over the network, such as email or FTP credentials.
   - Option B: No - This answer choice does not align with the attack sequence in the question. While it is possible that the malware might not deploy a network sniffer after gathering local credentials, the question specifically asks about the likelihood of this happening after the described sequence of TTPs, and the sequence suggests that the malware would likely continue to gather more credentials.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Gather local credentials (browser data, stored credentials)
   - Deploy a network sniffer module to capture network traffic and discover user credentials being sent over the network
   - Target and exfiltrate credentials from password stores.
