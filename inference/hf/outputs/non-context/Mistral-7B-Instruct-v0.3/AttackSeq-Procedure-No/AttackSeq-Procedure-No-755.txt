 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists "Exfiltration Over Command and Control" (T1078) as a common technique used by threat actors after establishing a connection with the command and control server. However, it is also common for threat actors to perform initial reconnaissance to gather network and system information before exfiltrating data.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After establishing a connection with the command and control server, the Rising Sun implant receives commands.
   - One of these commands could be to perform initial reconnaissance, which would involve decrypting and collecting network and system information.
   - This information could be used to further compromise the network, move laterally, or exfiltrate data.

Therefore, it is likely that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information after communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests.
