 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT42, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group. The TTPs mentioned are internal reconnaissance, pass the hash, and spear-phishing emails.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question does not suggest that pass the hash is used for lateral movement before sending spear-phishing emails. Pass the hash is typically used for gaining unauthorized access to systems, while spear-phishing emails are used for initial access or further spreading the attack.
   - In the given sequence, APT42 first conducts internal reconnaissance, which involves gathering system and network information. This is followed by pass the hash, which is a technique used to authenticate to a system without sending the password over the network. However, there's no indication that this is used for lateral movement.
   - Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets leveraging the victim's trusted relationships is a different TTP and is not directly related to pass the hash.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT42.
   - The sequence in the question is: Internal Reconnaissance > Pass the Hash.
   - Sending spear-phishing emails is a different TTP and is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that APT42 will use pass the hash for lateral movement before sending spear-phishing emails.
