 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Lazarus, a known threat actor, ensured web servers in a victim environment are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware to it.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A suggests that Lazarus first made the web servers accessible before copying malware, which aligns with the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This tactic often involves reconnaissance activities, such as discovering system network connections, which would require the web servers to be Internet accessible.
   - Answer B suggests that Lazarus did not make the web servers accessible before copying malware, which contradicts the Discovery tactic and the question's context.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves reconnaissance activities to gather information about the target environment.
   - Making web servers Internet accessible is a prerequisite for many Discovery techniques, such as system network connections discovery.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Lazarus would ensure web servers are Internet accessible before conducting discovery activities, as suggested in answer choice A.
