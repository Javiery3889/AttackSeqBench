 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question suggests a sequence of TTPs: Credential Access (dumping credentials using Mimikatz) -> Discovery (collecting system information and probing files).
   - Each answer choice is a yes or no response to this sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that the Discovery phase activities (collecting system information and probing files) are likely to occur after the Credential Access phase (dumping credentials using Mimikatz). This is because the Discovery phase often relies on the information obtained during the Credential Access phase to navigate and gather more information about the compromised system.
   - Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes". FamousSparrow is likely to collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.
