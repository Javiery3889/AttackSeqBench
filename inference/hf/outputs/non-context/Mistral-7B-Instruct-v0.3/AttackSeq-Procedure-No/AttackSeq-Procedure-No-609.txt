 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Hidden Cobra (a known threat actor) distributed Bankshot implants during the resource development phase. The question then asks if it is likely that the group would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during their reconnaissance phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs described in the question suggest that Hidden Cobra has already gained access to the victim's system through the Bankshot implant. It is plausible that after gaining access, they would use this implant to collect information on the victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase, as this is a common TTP for threat actors during the initial stages of an attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The resource development phase involves creating and distributing tools or implants to gain access to the target system. In this case, Hidden Cobra distributed Bankshot implants.
   - Once the implant is successfully installed, the threat actor can move to the next phase, which is often the reconnaissance phase. During this phase, the attacker gathers information about the target system and its environment to plan further actions.
   - Given that the Bankshot implant provides access to the target system, it is likely that Hidden Cobra would use this implant to collect information during the reconnaissance phase.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
