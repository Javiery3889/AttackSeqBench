 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor communicating with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves an adversary gathering information about the target environment. Process discovery and system information discovery are two techniques that fall under this phase. Since the backdoor has established a C2 channel, it is likely that it will use this channel to gather information about the target system, including process and system information.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor has established a C2 channel with the attacker.
   - After establishing a C2 channel, it is common for an adversary to gather information about the target system to better understand its environment and plan further actions.
   - Process discovery and system information discovery are techniques used to gather information about the target system during the Discovery phase.
   - Given that the backdoor has a C2 channel, it is likely that it will use this channel to perform process discovery and system information discovery.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.
