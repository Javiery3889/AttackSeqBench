 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an initial access method (weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The MSIL/Crimson malware is known to perform various TTPs, including executing native Windows functions to gather system information and prepare for further actions.
   - Executing native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo is a common practice for malware to gather information about the system, which can help it adapt its behavior to the target environment.
   - After gathering system information, it is likely that the malware will establish command and control to receive further instructions or communicate with its command server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: Weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 are used to gain access to the system and drop an embedded downloader file.
   - Post-Initial Access: The dropped downloader file, which is likely the MSIL/Crimson malware, will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo to gather system information.
   - Command and Control: After gathering system information, the malware will likely establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol to communicate with its command server and receive further instructions.

Therefore, it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.
