 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to drop the Taidoor malware and gain initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Taidoor will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks are techniques used by malware to evade detection and analysis in controlled environments such as sandboxes or virtual machines.
   - Taidoor is known to employ various evasion techniques, including anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks, to maintain its stealth and persistence.
   - Given that the question describes an attack sequence that involves dropping Taidoor malware, it is plausible that the malware would perform these checks before communicating with its CnC servers to ensure it is operating in a real environment and not being analyzed.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that involves dropping Taidoor malware and gaining initial access.
   - Taidoor is known to employ anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks as part of its evasion techniques.
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and Taidoor's known behavior, it is likely that Taidoor will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.
   - Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
