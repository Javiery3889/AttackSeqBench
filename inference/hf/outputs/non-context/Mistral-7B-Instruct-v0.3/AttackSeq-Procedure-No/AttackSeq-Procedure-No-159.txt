 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Targeted Attack (APT) 10 using remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives).
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that APT10 has gained initial access to the systems of interest and has started data exfiltration by using compression tools and multi-part archives.
   - Conducting internal reconnaissance to map out the network is a common TTP for APT groups, as it allows them to understand the network layout, identify additional targets, and move laterally within the network.
   - Using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for internal reconnaissance is a plausible TTP for APT groups, as these tools are widely available and can provide valuable information about the network infrastructure.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - APT10 has gained initial access to the systems of interest and has started data exfiltration by using remote command execution scripts and compression tools.
   - To further their attack, APT groups often conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network and identify additional targets.
   - Using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for internal reconnaissance is a common TTP for APT groups, as these tools can provide valuable information about the network infrastructure.
   - Therefore, it is likely that APT10 will conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
