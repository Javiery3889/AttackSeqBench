 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the execution of SparrowDoor, communication with a C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel, and no specific mention of Initial Access method other than internet-facing applications.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A suggests that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access. This is plausible because after executing SparrowDoor, it is likely that the attacker would need to gain initial access to the target system. Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications is a common method for Initial Access.
   - Answer B suggests that SparrowDoor did not exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access. However, this is less likely because the question mentions the execution of SparrowDoor, which is often used for Initial Access, and no other Initial Access method is specified.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the execution of SparrowDoor and communication with a C&C server.
   - SparrowDoor is a known malware that is often used for Initial Access.
   - The question does not specify any other Initial Access method, so it is reasonable to assume that SparrowDoor was used for Initial Access.
   - Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications is a common method for Initial Access.
   - Therefore, it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.
