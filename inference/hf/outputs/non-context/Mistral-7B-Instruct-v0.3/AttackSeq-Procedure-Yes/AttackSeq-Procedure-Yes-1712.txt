 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Mustang Panda, after using the double extension trick in a spearphishing campaign, is likely to utilize documents attempting to connect to Command and Control (C2) domains and IP addresses as part of their communication strategy.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Mustang Panda is known for using spearphishing campaigns and employing various TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to evade defenses. The double extension trick is one such TTP they use to bypass security measures.
   - Once the malicious document is opened, it can communicate with C2 servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. This is a common TTP used by many Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, including Mustang Panda.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that after using the double extension trick, Mustang Panda would continue their attack sequence by attempting to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Mustang Panda uses the double extension trick to evade defenses in a spearphishing campaign.
   - Step 2: The malicious document is opened, and it contains malware that communicates with C2 servers.
   - Step 3: The malware receives further instructions or exfiltrates data from the compromised system.

Therefore, it is likely that Mustang Panda would utilize documents attempting to connect to Command and Control (C2) domains and IP addresses as part of their communication strategy. Final Answer: Yes.
