 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group Gamaredon. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Backdoors to automatically list interesting files on a system for future exfiltration.
   - Malware to take screenshots every minute.
   - HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute before employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question does not suggest that Gamaredon would take screenshots before using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control. In fact, the sequence in the question shows that they use backdoors, then list files for future exfiltration, and only after that, they might use malware for screenshots.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Gamaredon.
   - The sequence starts with the use of backdoors to automatically list interesting files on a system for future exfiltration.
   - After that, it is possible that they might use malware for other purposes, such as taking screenshots.
   - However, the question asks if they will use malware for screenshots before employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.
   - The sequence in the question does not suggest this, as HTTP and HTTPS for command and control is not mentioned before the potential use of malware for screenshots.

Therefore, it is not likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute before employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.
