 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group Rocket Kitten. The TTPs mentioned are C&C communication, monitoring, and extracting information from victims, spear phishing, and social engineering.

2. Compare and Evaluate: To establish initial access on target machines, threat actors often use spear phishing and social engineering techniques. After gaining a foothold in the network, they can then monitor and extract information. In this case, it is plausible that Rocket Kitten would employ spear phishing and social engineering to establish initial access on target machines after using C&C communication to monitor and extract information from victims.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Rocket Kitten has already used C&C communication to monitor and extract information from victims, indicating they have some level of access or presence in the network.
   - To further penetrate the network and gain more control, they would need to establish initial access on target machines.
   - Spear phishing and social engineering are common techniques used by threat actors to trick users into providing credentials or downloading malware, which can grant the attacker initial access to a target machine.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Rocket Kitten would employ spear phishing and social engineering to establish initial access on target machines.
