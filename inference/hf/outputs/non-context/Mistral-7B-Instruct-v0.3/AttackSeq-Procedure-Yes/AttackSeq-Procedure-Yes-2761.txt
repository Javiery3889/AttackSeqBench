 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a UEFI firmware-level compromise and tampering with the CORE_DXE component for execution. This indicates an initial access and persistence phase of an attack.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - MoonBounce is a malware known for its in-memory execution and lateral movement capabilities. By securing a foothold at the firmware level, the attacker has already bypassed traditional antivirus and endpoint detection systems, making it more likely for MoonBounce to operate entirely in memory to evade further detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access and Persistence: The attacker has compromised the UEFI firmware and tampered with the CORE_DXE component for execution, securing a foothold in the system.
   - Evasion: To evade detection, MoonBounce is designed to operate entirely in memory, making it difficult for traditional antivirus and endpoint detection systems to detect its presence.
   - Lateral Movement: Once the attacker has established a foothold and evaded detection, they can use MoonBounce's lateral movement capabilities to move within the network.
