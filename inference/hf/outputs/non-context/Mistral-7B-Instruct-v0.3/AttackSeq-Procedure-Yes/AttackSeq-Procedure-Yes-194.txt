 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving Initial Access (exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities), Execution (running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor), and Command and Control (SparrowDoor communicating with the C&C server).

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are Yes and No. To determine the most plausible sequence, we need to consider the nature of Command and Control (C&C) communication in a typical attack scenario. It is common for malware like SparrowDoor to communicate with its C&C server to receive further instructions, and using an encrypted HTTPS channel for this communication is a common method to evade detection. Therefore, it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications allows the attacker to gain access to the target system.
   - Execution: Running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor allows the attacker to install the malware on the target system.
   - Command and Control: SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server to receive further instructions. Using an encrypted HTTPS channel for this communication is a common method to evade detection, making it likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.
