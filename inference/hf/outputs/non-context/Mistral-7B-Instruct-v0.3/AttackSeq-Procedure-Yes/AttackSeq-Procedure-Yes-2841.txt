 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an initial access to a victim's machine through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and attempt to download the full RAT component from a specific IP address before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and attempt to download the full RAT component from the specified IP address before establishing command and control.
   - This sequence aligns with the attack sequence described in the question, as the initial access leads to the execution of the malware, followed by the download of the RAT component, and finally the establishment of command and control.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the MSIL/Crimson malware will not execute or attempt to download the RAT component, which contradicts the sequence of events described in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: Weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 are used to gain access to the victim's machine and drop an embedded downloader file.
   - Execution of Malware: The dropped downloader file executes, leading to the installation of the MSIL/Crimson malware on the victim's machine.
   - Download of RAT Component: The MSIL/Crimson malware downloads the full RAT component from the specified IP address (213.136.87[.]122:10001).
   - Establishment of Command and Control: The MSIL/Crimson malware establishes command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

Given this sequence of events, answer choice A is the most plausible.
