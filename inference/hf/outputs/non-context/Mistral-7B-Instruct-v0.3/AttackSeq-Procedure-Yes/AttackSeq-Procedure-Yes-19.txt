 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the TTPs of establishing persistence and installing malware.
   - The question asks if "Machete" is likely to log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not provide any information about "Machete" or its TTPs related to logging keystrokes or copying files to a USB device.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question (establishing persistence and installing malware) do not inherently imply that "Machete" will perform the additional TTPs of logging keystrokes and copying files to a USB device.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the TTPs of establishing persistence and installing malware, but does not provide any information about "Machete" or its TTPs related to logging keystrokes or copying files to a USB device.
   - Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say that "Machete" will log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device based on the information provided in the question.
   - Since the question does not provide enough evidence to support the answer "Yes", the most plausible answer is "No".
