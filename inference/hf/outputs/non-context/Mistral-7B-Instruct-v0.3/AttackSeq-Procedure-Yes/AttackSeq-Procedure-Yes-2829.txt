 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Nemesis bootkit, after infecting the system's VBR, will evade detection by executing before the Windows operating system fully loads, bypassing typical operating system integrity checks.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Nemesis bootkit infects the VBR, which is executed during the boot process before the Windows operating system fully loads. This means the malware has the opportunity to execute before the operating system integrity checks are performed, making it more likely to evade detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Nemesis bootkit infects the VBR, which is the master boot record of a hard disk.
   - When the system boots, the VBR is executed first, loading the operating system.
   - Since the malware is part of the VBR, it executes before the Windows operating system fully loads, giving it the opportunity to bypass typical operating system integrity checks.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware will evade detection by executing before the Windows operating system fully loads, as stated in answer choice A.
