 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to CosmicDuke's discovery phase, where it searches removable drives for files while skipping certain file types.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - CosmicDuke is known for its data exfiltration capabilities, and it often uses various methods to collect sensitive information.
   - One of the techniques CosmicDuke employs is a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.
   - After collecting data, it exfiltrates the information to remote servers via FTP.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types (Discovery), it is likely that CosmicDuke will want to collect data from the system (Collection).
   - One of the methods CosmicDuke uses for data collection is a clipboard stealer (Collection).
   - Once it has collected the data, it will exfiltrate the information to remote servers via FTP (Exfiltration).

Therefore, it is likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.
