 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) related to a cyber attack by Tropic Trooper. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Initial Access: Exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package.
   - Delivery: Malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper.
   - Execution: Execution of malicious documents.
   - Persistence: Decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the command-and-control servers via SSL.

2. Compare and Evaluate: To determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs, we need to consider the logical flow of the attack.
   - After gaining initial access, it is likely that the attacker would deliver the malicious document (Dropper) to the compromised system.
   - Once the document is delivered, it will be executed, which triggers the backdoor.
   - After the backdoor is executed, it establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the command-and-control servers via SSL.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package.
   - Step 2: The malicious document hosting the backdoor's dropper is delivered to the compromised system.
   - Step 3: The malicious document is executed, triggering the backdoor.
   - Step 4: The backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the command-and-control servers via SSL.

Given this sequence, the most plausible answer is A: Yes, malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.
