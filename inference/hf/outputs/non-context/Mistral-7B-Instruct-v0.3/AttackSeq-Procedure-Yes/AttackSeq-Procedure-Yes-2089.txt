 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes credential access, discovery, and movement across the infrastructure.
   - The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with this sequence, as finding admin-level credentials (credential access) is a common step before moving laterally (movement) across the infrastructure, especially after compromising additional endpoints through discovery.
   - The answer choice "No" would imply that the attackers moved directly to compromising the Domain Administrator account without first finding admin-level credentials, which is less likely given the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - Credential Access (attackers obtain domain administrative credentials)
   - Discovery (attackers use the obtained credentials to compromise additional endpoints)
   - Movement (attackers move across the infrastructure using the compromised endpoints as a stepping stone)
   - Potential next step: Privilege Escalation (attackers aim to find admin-level credentials on the compromised endpoints)
   - Final Movement: Domain Administrator account is compromised and used to move across the entire infrastructure.
