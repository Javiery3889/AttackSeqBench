 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15, a known advanced persistent threat group. The sequence includes:
     - Gaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz
     - Using the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network
     - Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that APT15 will use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network before deploying backdoors. This sequence aligns with the attack sequence described in the question, as gaining access to the network is a prerequisite for deploying backdoors.
   - Answer choice B suggests that APT15 will not use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network before deploying backdoors. This sequence does not align with the attack sequence described in the question, as gaining access to the network is a necessary step before deploying backdoors.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: APT15 uses Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - Step 2: APT15 uses the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network. This allows them to move laterally within the network.
   - Step 3: APT15 deploys backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution. These backdoors provide persistence and allow APT15 to maintain access to the network and perform further actions.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Gain domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz
   - Use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network
   - Deploy backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution.

And the final answer is A: Yes.
