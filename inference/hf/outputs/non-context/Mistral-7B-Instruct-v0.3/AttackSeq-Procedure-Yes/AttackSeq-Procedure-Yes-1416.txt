 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving ChromeLoader overriding macOS security technology, an animated image, and potential use of public cloud storage services for C2 communication.
   - The question also mentions CloudMensis and CVE-2020-9934, which is a vulnerability in XcodeGhost that allows arbitrary code execution on iOS and macOS.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not provide any information about CloudMensis exploiting CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC restrictions.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not necessarily imply that CloudMensis would use CVE-2020-9934 before using public cloud storage services for C2 communication.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions ChromeLoader, but it does not specify any connection between ChromeLoader and CloudMensis.
   - The question also mentions an animated image, which is a technique often used for phishing or social engineering, but it does not necessarily imply the use of CVE-2020-9934.
   - The question mentions public cloud storage services for C2 communication, but it does not specify any connection between this and CVE-2020-9934.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not plausible to assume that CloudMensis would exploit CVE-2020-9934 for bypassing TCC restrictions before using public cloud storage services for C2 communication.

In conclusion, the answer is B: No.
