 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the execution of a backdoor (Milestone) on infected systems using PowerShell scripts and batch files.
   - It also mentions the possibility of Deep Panda (an Advanced Persistent Threat group) performing system information discovery and communicating with a Command and Control (C2) server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In many APT attacks, including those attributed to Deep Panda, the initial compromise is followed by a reconnaissance phase where the attacker gathers system information to better understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - Communication with a C2 server is often a later stage in the attack, after the attacker has gathered enough information about the system.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Deep Panda would perform system information discovery before utilizing the backdoor to communicate with a C2 server.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests an initial compromise followed by system information discovery and communication with a C2 server.
   - This sequence aligns best with the attack sequence often seen in APT attacks, where the initial compromise is followed by a reconnaissance phase and then communication with a C2 server.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Deep Panda would perform system information discovery before utilizing the backdoor to communicate with a C2 server.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
