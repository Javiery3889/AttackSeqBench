 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a Flash zero-day exploit is used to gain arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, followed by the execution of a second stage shellcode. The question then asks if it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns best with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. After gaining arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, the second stage shellcode could be designed to download the FinSpy payload and establish communication with C2 servers.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This answer choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. If the second stage shellcode does not download the FinSpy payload and establish communication with C2 servers, it would not be following a typical sequence of TTPs for an attack using a zero-day exploit.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: A Flash zero-day exploit is used to gain arbitrary read/write memory capabilities.
   - Step 2: A second stage shellcode is executed using the arbitrary read/write memory capabilities.
   - Step 3: The second stage shellcode downloads the FinSpy payload from a specified location.
   - Step 4: The second stage shellcode establishes communication with C2 servers to receive further instructions and control.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control. Therefore, the final answer is Yes.
