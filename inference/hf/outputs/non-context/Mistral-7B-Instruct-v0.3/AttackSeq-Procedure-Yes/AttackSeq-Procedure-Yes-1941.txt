 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Smooth Operator malware. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Establishing communication with C2 servers over HTTPS
   - Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation
   - Exfiltrating collected data

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not provide information about the method used for exfiltrating data from the second-stage payload.
   - The answer choices do not specify a specific method for exfiltration after the second-stage payload.
   - However, the question mentions the use of HTTPS for communication and a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, which are more likely to be used for initial communication and data transfer, not necessarily for exfiltration from the second-stage payload.
   - The question does not suggest that the malware will automatically exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request after the second-stage payload.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the initial communication and obfuscation methods used by the malware.
   - The question does not provide information about the method used for exfiltrating data from the second-stage payload.
   - The question does not suggest that the malware will automatically exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request after the second-stage payload.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the Smooth Operator malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.
