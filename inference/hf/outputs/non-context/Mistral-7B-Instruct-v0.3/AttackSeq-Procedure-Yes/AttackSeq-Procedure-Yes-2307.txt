 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary uses Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and discovery of target systems and data of interest. The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the attack sequence described in the question. After discovering the target systems and data of interest, it is a common TTP for an adversary to copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This answer choice contradicts the attack sequence described in the question. It is not likely that an adversary would skip copying the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The adversary uses Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and discovers target systems and data of interest.
   - Step 2: The adversary copies the results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives.
   - Step 3: The adversary exfiltrates the copied data using cloud storage web services.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is likely that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is represented by Answer Choice A: Yes.
