 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving credential dumping using a PowerShell script (likely related to Mimikatz) and reading the memory of lsass.exe.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - After gaining credentials, attackers often perform system fingerprinting to understand the target system's configuration and vulnerabilities. This is a common TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Domain trust discovery is another common TTP that helps attackers move laterally within a network. Using tools like nltest.exe and ping.exe for this purpose is also a common practice.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the attackers have already gained initial access to the system and are now looking to expand their reach within the network. System fingerprinting and domain trust discovery are logical next steps in this scenario.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After successfully dumping credentials, attackers often aim to escalate their privileges and move laterally within the network.
   - System fingerprinting is a crucial step in understanding the target system's configuration and vulnerabilities, which can help the attacker tailor their attack to the specific environment.
   - Domain trust discovery allows the attacker to identify other systems within the network that they can potentially access using the stolen credentials. This is often done using tools like nltest.exe and ping.exe.
   - In this case, the attackers have already performed credential dumping and memory reading, suggesting they have initial access to the system. Given these TTPs, it is likely that they will proceed with system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - Credential dumping using a PowerShell script (likely related to Mimikatz) and reading the memory of lsass.exe
   - System fingerprinting
   - Domain trust discovery using commands like nltest.exe and ping.exe.
