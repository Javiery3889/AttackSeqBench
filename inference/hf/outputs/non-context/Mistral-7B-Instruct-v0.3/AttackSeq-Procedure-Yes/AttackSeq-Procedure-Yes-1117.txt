 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker named LYCEUM.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks
     - Delivering DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments
     - Deploying an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop
     - Execution of arbitrary commands via cmd.exe

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would deploy an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware before utilizing it for execution of arbitrary commands via cmd.exe.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that LYCEUM first gained initial access, then delivered the DanBot malware, and now we are asked if they would deploy DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware.
   - Deploying DanDrop as a tool to drop the DanBot malware before executing arbitrary commands via cmd.exe aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by LYCEUM, which includes initial access, delivering DanBot malware, and executing arbitrary commands via cmd.exe.
   - The sequence suggests that LYCEUM would first gain initial access, then deliver the DanBot malware, and then deploy an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware before executing arbitrary commands via cmd.exe.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     - Initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks
     - Delivering DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments
     - Deploying an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware
     - Execution of arbitrary commands via cmd.exe
   - Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that LYCEUM would deploy an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware before utilizing it for execution of arbitrary commands via cmd.exe.
