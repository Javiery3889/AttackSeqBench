 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that Blind Eagle might use after gaining initial access through a JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord CDN. The sequence in question includes using PowerShell to load DLLs, performing AMSI bypass, and achieving persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language used by many threat actors for various purposes, including loading DLLs and bypassing security solutions like AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface). However, the sequence in the question skips several common steps that are typically seen in an attack sequence. For instance, Blind Eagle might first establish command and control (C2) communication, perform reconnaissance, or laterally move within the network before focusing on evasion techniques like AMSI bypass.
   - Placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup is a common persistence technique, but it is not typically the first persistence method used after performing AMSI bypass with PowerShell. More often, threat actors would use PowerShell itself for persistence, such as by creating a scheduled task or modifying the Windows Registry.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question, it is unlikely that Blind Eagle would first use PowerShell to load DLLs and perform AMSI bypass before achieving persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup. A more plausible sequence would involve establishing C2 communication, performing reconnaissance, and then using PowerShell for persistence before focusing on evasion techniques like AMSI bypass.

Therefore, the answer is "No".
