 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where attackers have executed a backdoor (Backdoor.Agent.Hza) and installed additional malware on SK Communications computers.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that these infected computers communicated with the command and control server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the infected computers communicated with the command and control server, which aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question. The backdoor (Backdoor.Agent.Hza) is typically used to establish a persistent connection for the attacker to control the infected system, and the additional malware installed could be designed to communicate with a command and control server.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the infected computers did not communicate with the command and control server, which contradicts the TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The backdoor (Backdoor.Agent.Hza) is a technique used to establish a persistent connection for the attacker to control the infected system.
   - The additional malware installed could be designed to communicate with a command and control server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - The question mentions that the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41. This IP address could be the location of the command and control server.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the infected computers communicated with the command and control server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41.
