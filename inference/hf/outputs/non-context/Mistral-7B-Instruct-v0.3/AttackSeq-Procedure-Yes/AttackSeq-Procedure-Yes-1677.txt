 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) associated with the WastedLocker ransomware. The TTPs mentioned are Defense Evasion (using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender) and Impact (encrypting computers and servers, causing disruption, and demanding a ransom).

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are binary (Yes or No). The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the ransomware will indeed encrypt computers and servers, causing disruption, and demanding a ransom in the Impact phase. Therefore, the correct answer is "Yes".

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the deployment of WastedLocker ransomware using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender, which is a Defense Evasion tactic.
   - After Defense Evasion, the next logical step in a ransomware attack is the Impact phase, where the ransomware encrypts files on the targeted systems.
   - The question also mentions that this encryption will cause significant disruption and demand a multimillion-dollar ransom, which are typical characteristics of the Impact phase in a ransomware attack.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a ransom in the Impact phase.
