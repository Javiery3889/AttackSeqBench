 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of Mimikatz to dump credentials, Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks, and Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement. The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will execute commands to discover system network configuration on the compromised server before using lateral movement techniques.

2. Compare and Evaluate: To answer this question, we need to consider the logical flow of an attack. After gaining access to a system (using Mimikatz and pass-the-hash), the attacker would likely want to understand the network layout to plan their next moves effectively. This would involve discovering system network configuration. Once they have this information, they can use it to execute lateral movement techniques, such as Impacket's atexec tool, to move across the network using the dumped credentials.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The attacker gains access to a system using Mimikatz and pass-the-hash attacks.
   - Step 2: To maximize the impact of their attack, the attacker would likely want to understand the network layout to plan their next moves effectively. This would involve discovering system network configuration.
   - Step 3: With the network configuration, the attacker can use it to execute lateral movement techniques, such as Impacket's atexec tool, to move across the network using the dumped credentials.

Therefore, it is likely that the threat actors will execute commands to discover system network configuration on the compromised server before using lateral movement techniques involving dumped credentials and Impacket's atexec tool.
