 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the Bandook campaign, specifically focusing on Defense Evasion, Process Hollowing, and AES encryption.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Defense Evasion technique is used to conceal malicious components, which is the initial step in the sequence.
   - Process Hollowing is a technique used to load a malicious executable into a legitimate process's memory space, replacing the original executable. This technique is often used for Execution and Command & Control (C2) phases, not necessarily for Defense Evasion.
   - AES encryption is a technique used for secure communication between the attacker and the compromised system (Command & Control phase).

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions Defense Evasion first, which is the initial step in the attack sequence.
   - Process Hollowing is not typically used during the Defense Evasion phase but rather during the Execution phase, where the attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process.
   - AES encryption is used during the Command & Control phase, where the attacker communicates with the compromised system securely.

4. Conclusion: Given the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, it is not likely that the Bandook campaign would use Process Hollowing within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload before employing AES encryption for communication with the C&C server. The most plausible sequence would be Defense Evasion -> Execution (Process Hollowing) -> Command & Control (AES encryption). However, the question does not provide enough information to definitively state this sequence for the Bandook campaign.
