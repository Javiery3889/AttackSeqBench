 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by Russian-speaking cybercriminals, which includes deploying malicious attachments or web-links via spear-phishing and phishing mass-mailing to gain initial access. The question then asks if it is likely that they will download programs for remote administration tools to compromise systems' administrators' credentials during the execution phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. After gaining initial access, it is a common tactic for cybercriminals to download and execute remote administration tools to further compromise the system and gain more control, including accessing administrator credentials.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This answer choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. If the cybercriminals have gained initial access, it is unlikely that they would not attempt to download and execute remote administration tools to further compromise the system.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The cybercriminals have gained initial access to the system through spear-phishing and phishing mass-mailing.
   - Step 2: To maintain control and access more sensitive information, they would likely download and execute remote administration tools.
   - Step 3: These tools can be used to compromise systems' administrators' credentials, giving the cybercriminals even more control over the compromised system.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Gain initial access (via spear-phishing and phishing mass-mailing)
   - Download and execute remote administration tools
   - Compromise systems' administrators' credentials.
