 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving initial access, delivery of phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments, employees enabling macros, and the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will establish a connection from the malicious implant to an attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server before enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A: Yes
     - This answer choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. After gaining initial access and installing the malware, it is common for malware to establish a connection to a C2 server to receive further instructions. This connection allows the attacker to control the malware and direct it to perform additional actions, such as internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
   - Answer choice B: No
     - This answer choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. It is likely that the malware will establish a connection to a C2 server before performing internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting, as the C2 server is often used to provide the malware with instructions on what actions to perform next.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After gaining initial access and installing the BlackEnergy 3 malware, it is likely that the malware will establish a connection to an attacker-controlled C2 server to receive further instructions. This connection allows the attacker to control the malware and direct it to perform additional actions, such as internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
