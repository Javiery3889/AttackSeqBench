 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that attackers will use the SocGholish framework for initial compromise and then use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - SocGholish is a malicious document that exploits CVE-2017-0199 (Microsoft Equation Editor) to deliver malware. This technique is often used for initial compromise, as it allows attackers to gain access to a system by tricking the user into opening a malicious document.
   - The Get-NetComputer command from PowerView is a post-exploitation tool used for remote system discovery. It allows an attacker to enumerate information about other systems on the network once they have gained initial access.
   - Given that SocGholish is used for initial compromise and Get-NetComputer is used for post-exploitation, it is plausible that an attacker would use SocGholish first to gain access and then use Get-NetComputer to discover more systems on the network.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Attackers use SocGholish to deliver malware and gain initial access to a system.
   - Step 2: Once inside the system, the attacker uses PowerView's Get-NetComputer command to discover other systems on the network.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes", it is likely that the attackers will use the SocGholish framework for initial compromise before using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery.
