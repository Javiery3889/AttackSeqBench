 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that includes reconnaissance activities, gathering publicly available information, active discovery methods, and the installation of malicious implants (BlackEnergy 3) through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate: After the malware is installed on the network, it is likely that it will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers to receive further instructions and carry out its intended malicious activities. This is a common TTP for many types of malware, including BlackEnergy 3.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After reconnaissance activities, the attacker has gathered enough information about the target network to plan their attack.
   - The attacker then uses employee-enabled macro execution to install the BlackEnergy 3 malware on the network.
   - Once installed, BlackEnergy 3 will typically establish communication with its C2 servers to receive further instructions and carry out its malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, data destruction, or creating a foothold for further attacks.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Reconnaissance > Employee-enabled macro execution > Installation of BlackEnergy 3 > Establish communication with C2 servers. The answer is A: Yes.
