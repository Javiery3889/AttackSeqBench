 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a VBS script that has been obfuscated and configured to delete itself after execution for defense evasion.
   - It does not mention any communication with a command and control (C&C) server.
   - The question does not provide any information about the script's intended malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or privilege escalation, which are common TTPs associated with C&C communication.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server, but the question does not provide any evidence to support this.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the VBS script will not communicate with a C&C server, which aligns better with the information provided in the question, as there is no mention of C&C communication.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a VBS script that has been obfuscated and configured to delete itself after execution, which are TTPs associated with defense evasion.
   - These TTPs do not necessarily imply C&C communication, as the script could be designed to perform other malicious activities such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or privilege escalation without the need for C&C communication.
   - Since the question does not provide any evidence to suggest C&C communication, the most plausible answer is that the VBS script will not communicate with a C&C server.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
