 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to a cyber attack by Turla, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group. The sequence includes Persistence, Defense Evasion, and Collection.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Persistence: Turla is known for establishing hidden footholds in infected networks for long-term access. This is the initial step in the attack sequence.
   - Defense Evasion: To maintain their access and avoid detection, APT groups like Turla often use rootkits to conceal their activities. This would be a logical step to ensure the spying operation remains undetected.
   - Collection: After establishing persistence and evading detection, Turla operators would likely download specialized tools, such as password stealers, to gather sensitive information during the Collection phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Persistence: Turla establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks for long-term access.
   - Defense Evasion: To maintain their access and avoid detection, Turla uses a rootkit to conceal their spying operation.
   - Collection: After maintaining persistence and evading detection, Turla operators download specialized tools, like password stealers, to gather sensitive information.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the known tactics of Turla, it is likely that the malware will include a rootkit for Defense Evasion before its operators download specialized tools for the Collection phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
