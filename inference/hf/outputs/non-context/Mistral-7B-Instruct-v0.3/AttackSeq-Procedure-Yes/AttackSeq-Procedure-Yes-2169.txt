 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that includes spear phishing emails, OLE2 format documents, and Microsoft Word sending a GET request for reconnaissance.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that the attackers first send spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents. This is a common initial access vector for many attackers.
   - After gaining access through the OLE2 documents, the attackers perform reconnaissance by having Microsoft Word send a GET request to inform them about the installed software on the victim's system. This technique is often used by advanced threat actors to gather information about their target environment.
   - Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns best with answer choice A: Yes.
