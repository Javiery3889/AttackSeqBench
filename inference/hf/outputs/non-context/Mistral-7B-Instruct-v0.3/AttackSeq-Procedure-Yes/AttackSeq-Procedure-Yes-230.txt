 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Defense Evasion: Using a loader DLL to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory.
   - Command and Control (C2): Connecting to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if the Lazarus group is likely to have the backdoors connect to command and control servers after decrypting and executing the backdoor in memory. This is a common TTP used by APT groups like Lazarus to maintain control over compromised systems and conduct further activities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After decrypting and executing the backdoor in memory, the Lazarus group needs a way to communicate with the compromised system to issue commands and conduct activities.
   - Connecting to command and control servers is a common method used by APT groups to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Lazarus group will have the backdoors connect to command and control servers to continue their activities.

In conclusion, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - Defense Evasion: Using a loader DLL to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory.
   - Command and Control (C2): Connecting to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities.
