 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the Initial Access phase where an adversary sends emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s during the Resource Development phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Resource Development phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves the adversary establishing and maintaining access to resources for future operations.
   - Using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s (Command and Control) can be considered as establishing resources for future operations, such as delivering malware to additional targets or maintaining persistence in the compromised network.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the adversary would perform these TTPs during the Resource Development phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - In the Initial Access phase, the adversary gains access to the target network through a phishing email with a malicious PDF link (TTP: Phishing, Initial Access).
   - In the Resource Development phase, the adversary needs to establish and maintain resources for future operations. One way to do this is by compromising webservers to host delivery scripts for further distribution of malware and using VPSs to host malware C2s (TTP: Command and Control, Resource Development).
   - Since the question asks if it is likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers and VPSs for these purposes, and given the nature of the Resource Development phase, it is plausible that the adversary will perform these TTPs in this sequence.
