 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the TAIDOOR loader decrypts and executes RAT files in memory. This suggests that the malware is already active and running in the system.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The malware, once active, would typically establish command and control (C2) communication to receive further instructions. This is a common TTP in many types of malware, including RATs (Remote Access Trojans). The question also mentions that the C2 servers' domains and IP addresses have been identified, which further supports the likelihood of C2 establishment.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The TAIDOOR loader has decrypted and executed the RAT files, indicating that the malware is now active in the system.
   - Malware, especially RATs, often establish C2 communication to receive further instructions.
   - The question mentions that the C2 servers' domains and IP addresses have been identified, which suggests that the malware is likely to use these for C2 communication.

Therefore, it is likely that the malware will establish command and control by connecting to C2 servers using the identified domains and IP addresses.
