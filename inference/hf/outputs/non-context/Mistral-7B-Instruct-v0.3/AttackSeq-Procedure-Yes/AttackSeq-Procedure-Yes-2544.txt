 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen on the infected system.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Milestone backdoor, once installed, typically has discovery capabilities to gather system information and capture the screen.
   - After gaining this information, it is a common TTP for malware to exfiltrate data, often through the Command and Control (C2) channel, to the attacker's server for further analysis or exploitation.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Milestone backdoor, once installed, will first use its discovery capabilities to gather system information and capture the screen on the infected system (TTP 1).
   - After successfully gathering this information, it is likely that the backdoor will then use the C2 channel to exfiltrate the data to the attacker's server for further analysis or exploitation (TTP 2).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
   - TTP 1: Discover system information and capture the screen
   - TTP 2: Exfiltrate data over the C2 channel

Final Answer: Yes.
