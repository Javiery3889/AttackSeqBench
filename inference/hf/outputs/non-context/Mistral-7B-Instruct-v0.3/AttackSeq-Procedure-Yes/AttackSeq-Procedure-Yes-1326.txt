 To answer this question, let's first analyze the given sequence of TTPs:

1. Targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery.
2. (The question asks if it's likely that the malware searches removable drives for files.)

Now, let's compare and evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
B: No

The question asks if it's likely that the malware searches removable drives for files, but we don't have specific information in the given sequence of TTPs that confirms or denies this action. However, malware often seeks to expand its reach and collect as much data as possible. Given this context, it's plausible that the malware might search removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes. It is likely that the malware searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.
