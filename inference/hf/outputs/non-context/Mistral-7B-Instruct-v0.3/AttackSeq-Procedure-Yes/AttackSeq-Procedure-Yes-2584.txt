 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the discovery of system information and active TCP connections, which are common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware during the Initial Access and Reconnaissance phases of an attack.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are binary, either the malware communicates with the C&C servers or it does not. The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the malware has already gained access to the system and has performed reconnaissance, making it likely that it would then proceed to communicate with the Command and Control (C&C) servers.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After gaining initial access and performing reconnaissance, malware often establishes communication with its C&C servers to receive further instructions or report back its findings.
   - The question mentions the discovery of system information and active TCP connections, which are common TTPs during the Initial Access and Reconnaissance phases.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware would communicate with the identified C&C servers at the given IP addresses using application layer protocols.

In conclusion, the malware is likely to communicate with the C&C servers at IP addresses 125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218 using application layer protocols.
