 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the use of API hooking techniques to evade detection and modify functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory. This suggests an advanced persistent threat (APT) or sophisticated attacker, such as Waterbear, is involved.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns well with the attack sequence described in the question. Advanced attackers like Waterbear often use encryption/decryption keys to secure their communication with external entities to avoid detection. XOR-encrypted C&C server addresses are also a common technique used to obfuscate command and control infrastructure.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This answer choice contradicts the use of API hooking techniques, which is a common method used by advanced attackers to maintain persistence and evade detection. The use of encryption/decryption keys and XOR-encrypted C&C server addresses are also common practices among such attackers, making this answer less likely.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The question describes the use of API hooking techniques to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory. This suggests an advanced attacker is involved.
   - Step 2: Advanced attackers like Waterbear often use encryption/decryption keys to secure their communication with external entities to avoid detection.
   - Step 3: XOR-encrypted C&C server addresses are also a common technique used to obfuscate command and control infrastructure.
   - Step 4: Given the advanced nature of the attack described in the question, it is likely that the backdoor configuration will include an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address for its communication with external entities.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is that Waterbear's backdoor configuration will include an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address for its communication with external entities.
