 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Regin, after performing certain TTPs during the discovery phase, is likely to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes. The TTPs mentioned in the question are gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, and monitoring network traffic.

2. Compare and Evaluate: Regin is a highly advanced and sophisticated malware known for its stealthy and persistent nature. It is capable of a wide range of TTPs, including the ones mentioned in the question. In particular, Regin is known to perform network traffic analysis and low-level network traffic sniffing for data exfiltration and command and control communication.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Regin gathers information on processes and memory utilization during the discovery phase to understand the target environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - Regin scans for deleted files to recover any data that may have been deleted but still resides on the disk.
   - After establishing a foothold, Regin is likely to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes, such as data exfiltration, command and control communication, and reconnaissance.

Therefore, based on the attack sequence described in the question and the known TTPs of Regin, the most plausible answer is "Yes". Regin is likely to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes after performing the mentioned TTPs during the discovery phase.
