 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the establishment of persistence using a scheduled task to execute a payload, which in this case is SideTwist.
2. Compare and Evaluate: The SideTwist backdoor is known to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server using encrypted HTTP channels. Since the question mentions the SideTwist backdoor and the C&C server's domain (sarmsoftware[.]com), it is likely that the SideTwist backdoor would communicate with the C&C server using encrypted HTTP channels.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
- Persistence established using a scheduled task
- SideTwist payload executed
- SideTwist backdoor communicates with the C&C server (sarmsoftware[.]com) using encrypted HTTP channels.
