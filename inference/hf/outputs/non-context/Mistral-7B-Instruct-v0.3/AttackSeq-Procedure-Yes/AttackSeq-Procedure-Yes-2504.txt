 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes two separate attacks by different Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, APT3 and APT18.
   - APT3 exploits a zero-day vulnerability to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor, while APT18 delivers GH0ST RAT via phishing emails.
   - The question asks if it's likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses while GH0ST RAT calls out to an APT18 CnC address.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The SHOTPUT backdoor, delivered by APT3, is a malware that typically communicates with hardcoded Command and Control (CnC) addresses. This is a common TTP for this malware.
   - GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18, also communicates with CnC servers, but these servers are usually controlled by APT18, not hardcoded into the malware.
   - In this scenario, it's unlikely that the SHOTPUT backdoor, delivered by APT3, would communicate with APT18's CnC addresses, as these are separate attacks by different threat groups.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - APT3 delivers the SHOTPUT backdoor, which typically communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses.
   - APT18 delivers GH0ST RAT, which communicates with CnC servers controlled by APT18.
   - The question asks if it's likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with APT18's CnC addresses.
   - Since the SHOTPUT backdoor communicates with its own hardcoded CnC addresses and not APT18's CnC addresses, it's not likely that this will occur.

Therefore, the final answer is "No".
