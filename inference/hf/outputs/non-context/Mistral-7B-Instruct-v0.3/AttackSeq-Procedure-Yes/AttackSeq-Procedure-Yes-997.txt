 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to a cyber attack.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client (Collection phase)
     - Deployment of RYUK ransomware using both manual and scripted methods (Impact phase)
     - Remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The answer choices are either "Yes" or "No".
   - To determine the most plausible sequence, we need to consider if the described TTPs are likely to occur in the sequence mentioned in the question.
   - In a typical ransomware attack, the attacker would first exfiltrate data from the victim network (Collection phase) to have leverage over the victim before deploying the ransomware (Impact phase).
   - The use of remote code execution techniques such as WMI command execution and PsExec during the Impact phase is common for ransomware deployment, as it allows the attacker to execute the ransomware on multiple systems within the network.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the RYUK ransomware would be deployed a week later using both manual and scripted methods, which included remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs related to a cyber attack, where data is exfiltrated using the SmartFTP Client (Collection phase) and RYUK ransomware is deployed using both manual and scripted methods, which included remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec (Impact phase).
   - It is plausible that the RYUK ransomware would be deployed a week later using both manual and scripted methods, which included remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec, as this sequence aligns with the typical progression of a ransomware attack.
   - Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
