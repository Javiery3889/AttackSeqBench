 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to information gathering about the infected host and the absence of Shellbot establishing C&C communication.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A: Yes - This answer choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, as it suggests that Shellbot will establish C&C communication after information gathering, but the question does not provide any indication that this is the next step.
   - Answer B: No - This answer choice aligns best with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, as it suggests that Shellbot is not likely to establish C&C communication after the described information gathering, which is consistent with the absence of this TTP in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that Shellbot is not likely to establish C&C communication by using an IRC channel.
