 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a phishing campaign, the use of a malicious Microsoft Word document (Richard_Johnson.doc), and the execution of VBS (Visual Basic Script) macros.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that the attacker first gains initial access through phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document. After gaining access, it is likely that the attacker would use the document to execute VBS macros, as this is a common technique used in phishing attacks to download and execute malware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The attacker sends a phishing email containing a malicious Microsoft Word document (Richard_Johnson.doc).
   - Step 2: The victim opens the email and the malicious document, unknowingly granting the attacker initial access.
   - Step 3: The malicious document contains VBS macros, which the attacker triggers to download and execute malware.

Given this sequence of TTPs, the most plausible answer is "Yes", as it aligns with the common tactics used in phishing attacks.
