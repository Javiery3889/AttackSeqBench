 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs starting with gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails exploiting specific vulnerabilities.
   - The question then asks if Dropping Elephant, a known threat actor, uses a UPX packed backdoor to download PowerShell command line scripts and employs encoded blobs for defense evasion techniques after that.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Dropping Elephant is known to use various TTPs, but the specific sequence mentioned in the question is not a common pattern for them.
   - While Dropping Elephant does use PowerShell scripts and defense evasion techniques, they typically do not use UPX packed backdoors in this sequence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Dropping Elephant is known to use spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, they often use PowerShell scripts for further actions.
   - However, using UPX packed backdoors to download PowerShell scripts is not a common TTP for Dropping Elephant.
   - Encoded blobs are used by Dropping Elephant for defense evasion, but not typically after using UPX packed backdoors.

Therefore, the sequence described in the question is not a common TTP for Dropping Elephant, and the answer is "No".
