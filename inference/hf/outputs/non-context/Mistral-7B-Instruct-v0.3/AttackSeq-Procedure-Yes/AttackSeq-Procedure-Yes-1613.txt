 To answer this question, let's first analyze the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:

1. Backdoor malware used for communication with command-and-control servers and executing remote commands.
2. Deployment of Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.

Now, let's compare and evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
   - This answer choice suggests that after the Lazarus group used backdoor malware, they immediately deployed Hermes ransomware. However, there is no direct evidence in the question that the Lazarus group is known to deploy Hermes ransomware after using backdoor malware.

B: No
   - This answer choice suggests that the Lazarus group did not deploy Hermes ransomware after using backdoor malware. This is more plausible since the question does not provide any evidence that the Lazarus group deploys Hermes ransomware as part of their standard TTPs after using backdoor malware.

Final Answer: B: No. The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not suggest that the Lazarus group would deploy Hermes ransomware after using backdoor malware.
