 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, Procedure) used by Hidden Cobra (also known as Lazarus Group) in a spear phishing attack against Turkish financial organizations.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Spear phishing (Tactic: Initial Access)
     - Exploitation of CVE-2018-4878 (Technique: Exploit Public Facing Application)
     - Development of Bankshot implants (Tactic: Resource Development)
     - Full control over victim systems (Technique: Privilege Escalation)
     - Wiping files from the targeted system (Technique: Data Encrypted for Impact)

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.
   - All the TTPs mentioned in the question are part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and they are sequential in nature.
   - The question does not provide any information that would suggest that Hidden Cobra would not develop the Bankshot implants after gaining initial access through the spear phishing attack and exploiting CVE-2018-4878.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Hidden Cobra would develop the Bankshot implants with the capabilities mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Hidden Cobra targets Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access.
   - Step 2: After gaining initial access, Hidden Cobra develops the Bankshot implants, which provide them with full control over the victim systems (Resource Development).
   - Step 3: With full control over the victim systems, Hidden Cobra can perform privilege escalation to gain higher-level access (Privilege Escalation).
   - Step 4: Finally, Hidden Cobra can wipe files from the targeted system (Data Encrypted for Impact).

Therefore, it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.
