 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a scenario where Earth Wendigo has established a WebSocket connection for Command and Control (TTP 0009 - External Remote Services) and has a JavaScript backdoor (TTP 0007 - Scripting).

2. Compare and Evaluate: The JavaScript backdoor (TTP 0007) can be used to execute commands on the victim's machine (TTP 0008 - Command and Scripting Interpreter). One of the possible commands could be to collect email data (TTP 0016 - Data from Local System) and attachments (TTP 0017 - Data from Local File System). Once the data is collected, it can be sent back to the WebSocket server (TTP 0009) for exfiltration.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Earth Wendigo establishes a WebSocket connection for Command and Control (TTP 0009).
   - Step 2: JavaScript backdoor is used to execute commands on the victim's machine (TTP 0007).
   - Step 3: One of the commands is to collect email data and attachments (TTP 0016 and TTP 0017).
   - Step 4: The collected data is sent back to the WebSocket server for exfiltration (TTP 0009).

Therefore, it is likely that the JavaScript backdoor facilitated the exfiltration of mailbox content and attachments.
