 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving communication with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests, and the potential exfiltration of files to the C2 server and downloading files to the infected machine.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The KopiLuwak backdoor is a type of malware known for its ability to communicate with a C2 server, exfiltrate data, and download additional malicious payloads.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the known behavior of the KopiLuwak backdoor.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the KopiLuwak backdoor could exfiltrate files to the C2 server while also being able to download files to the infected machine.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The attacker compromises two legitimate websites.
   - Step 2: The infected machine communicates with these compromised websites using HTTP POST requests.
   - Step 3: The KopiLuwak backdoor, which is now present on the infected machine, establishes a connection with its C2 server.
   - Step 4: The backdoor exfiltrates files from the infected machine to the C2 server.
   - Step 5: The backdoor downloads additional malicious payloads from the C2 server to the infected machine.

Given this sequence of TTPs, it is likely that the KopiLuwak backdoor could exfiltrate files to the C2 server while also being able to download files to the infected machine. Therefore, the correct answer is "Yes".
