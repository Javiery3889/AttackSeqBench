 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving exploiting public-facing applications to upload webshells, using RDP for lateral movement, and the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' being utilized for data exfiltration.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' would be utilized for data exfiltration after the initial TTPs.
   - Using RDP for lateral movement suggests that the attacker has gained access to multiple systems within the network.
   - The backdoor 'IPsec Helper' is a known tool used for various purposes, including VPN configuration and data exfiltration.
   - Given that the attacker has gained access to the network and has moved laterally, it is plausible that they would use the 'IPsec Helper' to exfiltrate data to C2 servers as part of its execution functionality.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The attacker exploits public-facing applications to upload webshells, gaining initial access to the network.
   - Step 2: The attacker uses RDP for lateral movement, indicating they have gained access to multiple systems within the network.
   - Step 3: It is likely that the attacker would use the 'IPsec Helper' to exfiltrate data to C2 servers, as it is a known tool for data exfiltration and the attacker has already demonstrated the ability to execute commands on the network.

Therefore, the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' would be utilized to exfiltrate data to C2 servers as part of its execution functionality.
