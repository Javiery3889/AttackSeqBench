 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to the Collection phase (use of keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer) and asks about the Exfiltration phase (uploading collected information and contacting remote sites).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - CosmicDuke is a sophisticated cyber espionage group known for using various TTPs, including those mentioned in the question (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer).
   - According to various threat intelligence reports, CosmicDuke is also known to use FTP for data exfiltration, which aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question (uploading collected information to remote servers via FTP).
   - CosmicDuke is also known to use stored login credentials for FTP, and they may contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs in the Exfiltration phase after the Collection phase.
   - CosmicDuke is known to use FTP for data exfiltration, which involves uploading collected information to remote servers and potentially contacting live remote sites.
   - The use of stored login credentials for FTP is a common TTP for CosmicDuke, which further supports the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question and the known TTPs of CosmicDuke is that they would automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.
