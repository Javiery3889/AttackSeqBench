 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the NewPass implant, a loader library, decoding a configuration file, evading detection, communicating with a command-and-control server, and exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that the NewPass implant first evades detection and then communicates with the command-and-control server. This communication is often used for receiving further instructions or for the malware to report its status.
   - After the communication with the command-and-control server, the malware is then expected to perform the final action, which is exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The NewPass implant uses a loader library to decode its configuration file and evade detection (TTP 1 and TTP 2).
   - After evading detection, the malware communicates with the command-and-control server (TTP 3).
   - Finally, the malware exfiltrates information using encrypted POST requests (TTP 4).

Therefore, it is likely that the malware will communicate with the command-and-control server before exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.
