 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Agrius, which includes using an IPsec Helper backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP and perform actions such as updating relays or downloading files. However, the question does not provide any evidence or indication that Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' after these actions.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are 'Yes' and 'No'. The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not inherently lead to the deployment of wipers like 'Apostle'. While Agrius is known for using various malware, the question does not provide enough information to suggest that they would deploy wipers after the specific actions mentioned.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the use of an IPsec Helper backdoor and HTTP communication with C2 servers for file downloading and relay updating. These TTPs are common in various types of malware, including data stealers, backdoors, and remote access trojans.
   - However, the question does not provide any evidence or indication that Agrius would deploy wipers like 'Apostle' after these actions. The question does not mention any data destruction or ransomware-like activities, which are typical indicators of wiper malware.
   - Therefore, based on the information provided, it is more likely that Agrius did not deploy wipers like 'Apostle' after the described sequence of TTPs.
