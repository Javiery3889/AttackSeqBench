 To answer this question, let's break it down:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question is asking if the observed use of two different single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by DDOS C2 servers is likely to be related to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, causing Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files is a common technique used in DDoS attacks to obfuscate the command and control (C2) communication between the attacker and the compromised systems. However, this technique alone does not definitively prove that DDoS attacks were launched.
   - The question mentions a 'total failure' of Next Media's network, which could be a result of various types of cyber attacks, not just DDoS attacks.
   - The question also mentions websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, but there's no direct link established between these websites and the use of XOR keys.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files is a TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) often associated with DDoS attacks, but it's not conclusive evidence of a DDoS attack.
   - The question does not provide enough information to definitively link the observed TTP to the 'total failure' of Next Media's network or the targeting of websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.
   - Therefore, it's not possible to confirm with certainty that the observed TTPs are related to the described attack sequence.

Final Answer: No (This answer choice does not align best with the attack sequence in the question as there's insufficient information to confirm the sequence of events).
