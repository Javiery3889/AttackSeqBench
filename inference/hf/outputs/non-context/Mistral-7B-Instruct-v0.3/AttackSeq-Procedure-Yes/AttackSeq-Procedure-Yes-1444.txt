 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Taidoor malware uses a downloader to decrypt a modified version of itself to avoid detection. It does not mention any communication with the command-and-control servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are Yes and No. The sequence of TTPs described does not include any communication with the specified command-and-control servers, so it is unlikely that the new Taidoor variant will communicate with them.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the use of a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the Taidoor malware. This TTP is about evading detection, not communication.
   - The question does not mention any TTPs related to communication with the specified command-and-control servers.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the command-and-control servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.
