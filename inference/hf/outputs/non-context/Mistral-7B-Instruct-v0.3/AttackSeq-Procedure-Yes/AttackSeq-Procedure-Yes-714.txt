 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the initial access being achieved through the Sharpshooter downloader injected into Word via a malicious macro. The question then asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Sharpshooter downloader is often used as a first-stage malware to establish a foothold in a system. Once it's executed, it typically downloads and executes a second-stage payload, which can be another malware or a malicious implant like Rising Sun.
   - Rising Sun is known for its modular design, allowing it to download and execute additional modules for various malicious activities.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Rising Sun, as a second-stage payload, would download another payload to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access: Sharpshooter downloader is injected into Word through a malicious macro.
   - Initial Execution: Sharpshooter downloader executes and establishes a foothold in the system.
   - Download and Execution of Rising Sun: Sharpshooter downloads and executes the Rising Sun implant.
   - Rising Sun as a Downloader: Rising Sun downloads and executes another payload to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

Therefore, it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.
