 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT34 in their campaign.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Execution of malicious macros within a Word document
     - Verifying a mouse connection for anti-sandboxing
     - Communicating with the C2 server
     - Dropping an embedded executable with a '.doc' extension
     - Employing DNS tunneling for evasion using the requestbin.net DNS tunneling service

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malicious macros within the Word document executed actions such as verifying a mouse connection, communicating with the C2 server, and dropping an embedded executable before employing DNS tunneling.
   - It is plausible that these TTPs would occur in this sequence, as the malicious macros would first need to be executed to perform these actions, and then DNS tunneling could be employed for evasion once these initial steps have been taken.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malicious macros within the Word document would first be executed, allowing them to perform actions such as verifying a mouse connection, communicating with the C2 server, and dropping an embedded executable.
   - Once these initial steps have been taken, it is likely that APT34 would employ DNS tunneling for evasion using the requestbin.net DNS tunneling service.
   - Therefore, the malicious macros within the Word document would have executed these actions before DNS tunneling was employed.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
