 To answer this question, let's first understand the TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) involved and then compare them with the known tactics used by the Black Energy 2 malware.

1. Injecting a DLL into the svchost.exe process: This technique is used to maintain persistence by loading the malicious code into a legitimate system process, making it harder to detect.

2. Communicating with the malware through HTTP requests: This is a common technique for command-and-control (C2) communication, where the attacker sends commands to the infected system through HTTP requests.

Black Energy 2 is a known malware that primarily uses the EternalBlue exploit (CVE-2017-0144) and the DoublePulsar backdoor for initial compromise and lateral movement within a network. It is also known to use various methods for persistence, such as modifying the Windows Registry, but it does not typically inject DLLs into svchost.exe for persistence.

However, it does use HTTP for C2 communication.

So, based on the known TTPs of Black Energy 2, it is more likely that the malware will communicate with the C2 server through HTTP requests before injecting a DLL into the svchost.exe process.

Final Answer: No. Black Energy 2 is not likely to inject a DLL into the svchost.exe process to maintain persistence before the botnet's command-and-control center communicates with the malware through HTTP requests.
