 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elderwood Project attackers, which includes deploying zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks to gain initial access.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The establishment of command and control (C&C) servers is a common TTP used by attackers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers. Given that the attackers have gained initial access, it is likely that they would want to maintain that access for further operations. Establishing C&C servers is a logical next step to achieve this.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attackers have gained initial access to the target systems through zero-day exploits and watering hole attacks.
   - To maintain control over these compromised systems, the attackers need a way to issue commands and receive data from the systems.
   - Establishing C&C servers allows them to do this, as it provides a centralized location for communication and control.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will establish C&C servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.
