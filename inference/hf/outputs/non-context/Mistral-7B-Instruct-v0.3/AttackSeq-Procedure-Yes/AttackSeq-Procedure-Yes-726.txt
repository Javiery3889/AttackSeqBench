 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance and communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if it is likely that the implant would use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding to facilitate data exfiltration to the control server. Given that the implant has already used these encryption methods for communication, it is plausible that it would continue to use the same methods for data exfiltration to maintain consistency and avoid detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Rising Sun implant has already used RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for initial communication with the control server.
   - Maintaining consistency in encryption methods is a common tactic used by threat actors to avoid detection.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the implant would use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration to the control server.
