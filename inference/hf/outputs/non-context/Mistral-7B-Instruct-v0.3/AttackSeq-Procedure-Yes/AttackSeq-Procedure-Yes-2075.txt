 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - RIG Exploit Kit (RIG EK) is a malware delivery platform that often uses malvertising to redirect users to compromised websites. Once the user visits the compromised site, the RIG EK will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the user's system to deliver malware.
   - One of the techniques used by RIG EK is to use obfuscated PowerShell scripts to download and execute malware on the compromised system. This is done through the Command and Scripting Interpreter.
   - Therefore, the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question aligns with the known behavior of RIG EK.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The user is redirected to a compromised website due to malvertising.
   - Step 2: RIG EK attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the user's system.
   - Step 3: If successful, RIG EK delivers malware by running an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - Step 4: The PowerShell script fetches malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

The answer choice "Yes" is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question and the known behavior of RIG EK.
