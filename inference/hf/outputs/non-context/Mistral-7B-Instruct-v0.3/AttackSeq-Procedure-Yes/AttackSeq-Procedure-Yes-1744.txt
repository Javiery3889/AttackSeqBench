 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where TG1021 used a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation. The question then asks if it is likely that they removed all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question does not provide any information about the removal of disk-resident tools after the privilege escalation. However, it is common for attackers to maintain persistence on the compromised system, which would require leaving some form of disk-resident tool.
   - In this case, the attacker has already used a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, which suggests they are interested in maintaining access to the system for further activities.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that they would not remove all disk-resident tools, as this would limit their ability to maintain persistence and continue their attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where TG1021 used a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.
   - Attackers often maintain persistence on compromised systems to continue their attack, which requires leaving some form of disk-resident tool.
   - In this case, the attacker has already used a custom version of the Potato family tools, which suggests they are interested in maintaining access to the system for further activities.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that they would not remove all disk-resident tools, as this would limit their ability to maintain persistence and continue their attack.
   - Thus, the answer choice "No" is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the information provided in the question.
