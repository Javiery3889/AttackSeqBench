 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance and then communicates with control servers.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A suggests that the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests. This TTP is plausible as attackers often use HTTP for command and control communication due to its ubiquity and ease of blending in with normal network traffic.
   - Answer B suggests that the Rising Sun implant does not communicate with control servers via HTTP POST requests. However, given that the question mentions the implant performing initial reconnaissance and then communicating with control servers, it is more likely that it would use a common communication method like HTTP for this purpose.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Rising Sun implant has performed initial reconnaissance, which typically involves gathering network and system information.
   - After gathering this information, it is likely that the implant would need to communicate this information to its control servers for further instructions or analysis.
   - Using HTTP POST requests for command and control is a common TTP for many types of malware, including those known to use the Rising Sun implant. Therefore, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant would communicate with control servers via HTTP POST requests.
