 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials and locking out original account owners.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Option A: Yes - This answer choice aligns well with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. After gaining access to the accounts, the cybercriminals could demand ransom payments from the original account owners to regain control of their accounts. Additionally, they could use these accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams, such as promoting phishing sites, selling products, or spreading malware.
   - Option B: No - This answer choice does not align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. There is no reason given in the question that would prevent the cybercriminals from demanding ransom payments or using the stolen accounts for further scams.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials and locking out original account owners.
   - After gaining access to the accounts, it is likely that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments from the original account owners to regain control of their accounts.
   - Furthermore, they could use these accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams, such as promoting phishing sites, selling products, or spreading malware.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: Yes.
