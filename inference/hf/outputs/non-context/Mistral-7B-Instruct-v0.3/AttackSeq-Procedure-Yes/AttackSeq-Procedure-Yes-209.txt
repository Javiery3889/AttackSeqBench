 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker named FamousSparrow. The TTPs include using SparrowDoor for communication with the C&C server, using HTTPS for secure communication, and employing multi-byte XOR keys for encrypted communications.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor. Given that FamousSparrow has already established a secure communication channel with the C&C server using SparrowDoor and HTTPS, and they are using encrypted communications, it is plausible that they would also use this established channel for data exfiltration.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - FamousSparrow has already used SparrowDoor for secure communication with the C&C server.
   - They have also used encrypted communications, which suggests they are taking steps to secure their data.
   - Exfiltration of data is a common tactic in many types of attacks, and it would make sense for FamousSparrow to use the already established secure channel for this purpose.
   - Therefore, it is likely that FamousSparrow will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.
