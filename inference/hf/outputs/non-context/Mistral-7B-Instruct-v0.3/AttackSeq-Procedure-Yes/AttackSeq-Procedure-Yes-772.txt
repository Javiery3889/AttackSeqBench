 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving spear phishing emails with RTF document exploits (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: Spearphishing Attachment), followed by the delivery of QuasarRAT (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: Exploit for CVE-2017-8750).

2. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices are asking if the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the target user gets infected with QuasarRAT.

   - Answer A: Yes, suggests that the recipients will be presented with a document (a blog post or report) before the infection with QuasarRAT. This is plausible because attackers often use social engineering tactics to lure victims into opening the malicious RTF document by disguising it as a legitimate file.

   - Answer B: No, suggests that the recipients will not be presented with a document before the infection. However, this is less likely because it contradicts the common practice of using deceptive documents to trick victims into opening the malicious RTF file.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a spear phishing attack using RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery.
   - To make the attack more convincing, attackers often use social engineering tactics, such as disguising the malicious RTF document as a legitimate file (e.g., a blog post or report).
   - Therefore, it is likely that the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the target user gets infected with QuasarRAT.

In conclusion, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Spear phishing email with RTF document attachment
   - Document simulating a legitimate blog post or report (social engineering)
   - Exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery.
