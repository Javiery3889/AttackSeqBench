 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving obfuscated VBA-Macro functions, decoding JavaScript payloads, dropping a file into the system's temporary directory, and a JavaScript downloader dropping a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL. Additionally, it mentions 'surprise.php' revealing its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include the TTPs related to 'surprise.php' revealing its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe. The TTPs mentioned in the question are obfuscated VBA-Macro functions, decoding JavaScript payloads, dropping a file into the system's temporary directory, and a JavaScript downloader dropping a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL while 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include the TTPs related to 'surprise.php'. Therefore, it is not likely that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL while 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
