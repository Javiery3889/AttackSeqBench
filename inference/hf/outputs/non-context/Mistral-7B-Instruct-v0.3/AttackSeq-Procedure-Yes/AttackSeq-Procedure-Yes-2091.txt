 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker has gained access to the organization's internal network using Cobalt Strike beacon and collected administrative-level credentials.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer A: Yes - This answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence in the question. Once an attacker has gained access to the network and collected administrative-level credentials, it is likely that they will use these credentials to move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.
   - Answer B: No - This answer choice contradicts the attack sequence in the question. If the attacker has gained access to the network and collected administrative-level credentials, it is highly unlikely that they would not attempt to move laterally and compromise more systems.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is:
- Gain access to the network using Cobalt Strike beacon
- Collect administrative-level credentials
- Move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.
