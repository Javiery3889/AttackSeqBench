 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists several TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that FIN13 is known to use.
   - T1080 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) and T1087 (PowerShell) are techniques used for executing commands and scripts, which can be used for reconnaissance by gathering information on network and host configurations.
   - T1003 (File and Directory Discovery) and T1056 (PowerShell) are techniques used for discovering information about the system, which can also be used for reconnaissance.
   - T1007 (Process Injection) is a technique used for injecting code into a running process, and T1518 (DLL Search Order Modification) is a technique used for modifying the DLL search order to load a malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one. Both of these techniques can be used to dump LSASS process memory (T1005 - Process Dumping) to obtain credentials.
   - FIN13 is known to use a combination of these TTPs in their operations.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - First, FIN13 would likely use T1080, T1087, T1080, or T1056 to gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.
   - After gathering the necessary information, they would then use T1007 or T1518 to inject code into a running process, specifically the LSASS process.
   - Once they have injected the code, they would use T1005 to dump the LSASS process memory, which would contain the credentials they need for their operations.

Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations. The answer is "Yes".
