 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15:
     a. Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials
     b. Stealing a VPN certificate to access the network remotely
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS while leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that APT15 has already gained a high level of access within the network (domain administrator credentials and VPN certificate).
   - Deploying backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS) would be a common next step for an APT group to maintain persistence and further compromise the network.
   - Using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution is a known technique used by APT15 to execute commands without being detected.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - APT15 has already gained high-level access to the network (domain administrator credentials and VPN certificate).
   - Deploying backdoors is a common tactic for APT groups to maintain persistence and further compromise the network.
   - RoyalCLI is a known tool used by APT15 to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution, making it a likely choice for executing the backdoors without being detected.

Therefore, it is likely that APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS while leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.
