 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the delivery of KerrDown malware via Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives, and DLL side-loading. The question then asks if it is likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not include the use of an image file to instruct the victim to enable macros. The TTPs mentioned are delivery of the malware, use of macros or RAR archives, and DLL side-loading. While it is possible for an attacker to use various methods to trick victims into enabling macros, the question specifically asks about an image file being used for this purpose, which is not part of the sequence described.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the delivery of KerrDown malware via Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives, and DLL side-loading. This sequence of TTPs does not include the use of an image file to instruct the victim to enable macros.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture. However, the sequence of TTPs described does not include the use of an image file for this purpose.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

Final Answer: No.
