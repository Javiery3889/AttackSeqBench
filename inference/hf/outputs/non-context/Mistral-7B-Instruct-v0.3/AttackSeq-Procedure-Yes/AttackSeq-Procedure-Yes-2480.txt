 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spear phishing emails containing malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444. The goal of this attack is to execute code on victim systems.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence in the question. After gaining access to victim systems, it is a common TTP for attackers to establish command and control (C2) infrastructure, such as domains, to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.
   - Answer choice B: No - This answer choice contradicts the attack sequence in the question. If the attackers have gained access to victim systems, it is likely that they would need some form of C2 infrastructure to maintain control over the compromised systems.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario would be:
- Spear phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems.
- Acquiring infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control servers during resource development.
