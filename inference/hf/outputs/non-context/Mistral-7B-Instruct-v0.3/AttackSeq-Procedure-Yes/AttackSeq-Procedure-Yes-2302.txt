 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) during the Discovery phase, which includes using PsLogList for account discovery and potentially executing Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz to dump credentials of privileged users.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will attempt to clean-up traces from their intrusions during the Defense Evasion phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question (PsLogList, Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz, and potential data exfiltration) are all offensive actions that could leave traces in the system.
   - Cleaning up traces from intrusions is a common tactic used by adversaries during the Defense Evasion phase to avoid detection and analysis.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the adversary would attempt to clean up traces after their initial discovery and credential dumping activities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs during the Discovery phase that could potentially leave traces in the system.
   - Cleaning up traces is a common tactic used by adversaries during the Defense Evasion phase to avoid detection and analysis.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the adversary will attempt to clean up traces from their intrusions through activities such as Windows event logs clearing, file deletion, and timestomping during the Defense Evasion phase.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
