 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes the execution of the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices, which is a known behavior of certain malware. The app is designed to run in the background and hide its icon.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists "Discovery" as one of the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that malware often uses after initial access. Discovery involves gathering information about the system, including a list of processes.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning: After gaining access to the system, malware like XAgent would typically perform a series of actions. First, it would establish itself on the system by hiding its icon and running in the background. Next, it would perform Discovery to gather information about the system, including a list of processes. This information would then be sent out via HTTP to the Command and Control (C2) server for further analysis and control.

Therefore, it is likely that the app will collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server.
