 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by the threat group Gamaredon. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Using Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement
   - Sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets

2. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs suggests that Gamaredon has already gained access to a network (through the Outlook VBA macro and email attachment) and has the ability to move laterally within the network. Once an attacker has access to a network, it is a common TTP for them to deploy scripts or tools to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After gaining access to a network through the Outlook VBA macro and email attachment, Gamaredon has the ability to move laterally within the network.
   - Once an attacker has access to a network, they often seek to collect sensitive information.
   - Deploying scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents is a common TTP for attackers in the collection phase of an attack.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Gamaredon will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.
