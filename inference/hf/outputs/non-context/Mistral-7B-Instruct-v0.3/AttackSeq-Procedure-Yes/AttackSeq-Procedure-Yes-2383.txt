 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving initial access via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would perform execution using process hollowing before engaging in discovery activities.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Process hollowing is a technique used by malware to evade detection by replacing a legitimate process with malicious code. This technique is often used after initial access to avoid detection during the execution of malicious code.
   - Gathering system information and network views are discovery activities that malware may perform after initial access to understand the environment better.
   - Given that TDrop2 is a malware and the question mentions initial access, it is likely that the malware would want to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Initial Access (via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables) -> Process Hollowing (to evade detection) -> Discovery Activities (gathering system information and network views).
