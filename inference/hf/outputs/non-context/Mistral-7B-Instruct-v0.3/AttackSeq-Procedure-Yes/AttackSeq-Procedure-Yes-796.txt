 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the question:

1. Distribution of malicious LNK files (Social Engineering TTP)
2. Spear-phishing (Initial Access TTP)
3. Execution of a JavaScript file (Command and Control TTP)
4. Creation and execution of 'd3reEW.exe' (Command and Control TTP)
5. Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory (Persistence TTP)
6. Sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL (Command and Control TTP)

Now, let's compare and evaluate each answer choice:

A: Yes
   - The Higaisa APT group is known for using spear-phishing and LNK files for initial access, which aligns with the first two TTPs in the sequence.
   - They have also been observed using JavaScript for command and control, which aligns with the third TTP.
   - The creation and execution of 'd3reEW.exe' and copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory are common persistence techniques used by APT groups, which aligns with the fourth and fifth TTPs.
   - Sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL is a common command and control technique, which aligns with the sixth TTP.

B: No
   - While it's not impossible for the Higaisa APT group to perform these actions, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns more closely with the known tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the group.

Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will execute a JavaScript file to perform actions such as creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL after distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
