 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) where Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking for Defense Evasion. The question then asks about the Command and Control phase, specifically whether TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a technique often used to ensure secure communication between the attacker and the compromised system (in this case, TClient). However, the use of SSL does not necessarily follow the DLL hijacking technique used for Defense Evasion. The attacker could use various methods for Command and Control, and SSL is just one of them. The question does not provide any information suggesting that Tropic Trooper will use SSL for Command and Control.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question asks about the Command and Control phase, which is a separate phase from Defense Evasion.
   - DLL hijacking is a technique used for Defense Evasion, not Command and Control.
   - The question does not provide any information suggesting that Tropic Trooper will use SSL for Command and Control. Therefore, it is not likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.
