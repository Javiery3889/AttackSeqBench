 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) involving the use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads, followed by the execution of FakeRun loader and the injection of a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Tropic Trooper is a threat group known for using various techniques to establish persistence and maintain access to compromised systems. One of their tactics is known to involve the use of DLL side-loading and DLL injection.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the known tactics of Tropic Trooper. First, they execute an installer package with malicious payloads, which could be a way to establish initial access. Then, they execute the FakeRun loader, a technique often used to evade detection by launching legitimate executables. Finally, they inject a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, which is a known technique used by Tropic Trooper for maintaining persistence and facilitating their attack.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: Equation Editor exploits are used to execute an installer package with malicious payloads. This could be a way to establish initial access to the system.
   - Step 2: The FakeRun loader is executed to launch dllhost.exe. This is a technique often used to evade detection by launching a legitimate executable.
   - Step 3: A malicious DLL backdoor is injected into the dllhost.exe process. This is a known technique used by Tropic Trooper for maintaining persistence and facilitating their attack.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the question and the known tactics of Tropic Trooper, it is plausible that Tropic Trooper would execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process to facilitate their attack. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
