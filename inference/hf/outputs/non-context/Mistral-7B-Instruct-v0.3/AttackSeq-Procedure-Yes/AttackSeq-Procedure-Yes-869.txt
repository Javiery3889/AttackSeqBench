 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that GreyEnergy will first gain initial access through spearphishing or compromised public-facing web servers before employing stealth techniques like partial AES-256 encryption of modules for defense evasion.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists spearphishing (T1192) and web application attacks (T1190) as initial access techniques, which are often the first steps in an attack sequence.
   - Once initial access is gained, attackers can move laterally within the network and employ defense evasion techniques, such as AES-256 encryption (T1027).
   - Therefore, it is plausible that GreyEnergy would first gain initial access through spearphishing or compromised public-facing web servers before employing stealth techniques like partial AES-256 encryption of modules.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Initial Access (T1192 or T1190) is the first stage in an attack sequence, where an attacker gains access to a system.
   - After initial access, the attacker can move laterally within the network (T1021) and establish persistence (T1077) to maintain access.
   - Once established, the attacker can employ defense evasion techniques (T1027) to avoid detection.
   - In the case of GreyEnergy, they are known to use AES-256 encryption as a defense evasion technique.
   - Therefore, it is likely that they would first gain initial access through spearphishing or compromised public-facing web servers before employing stealth techniques like partial AES-256 encryption of modules.
