 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The sequence is as follows: T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, T1057 Process Discovery, and T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1553 Subvert Trust Controls is used to evade defenses by manipulating trust relationships.
   - T1057 Process Discovery is a technique used to gather information about the systems and internal networks of a compromised organization.
   - T1071 Application Layer Protocol is a technique used to leverage compromised infrastructure for command and control.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Threat actors might use T1553 Subvert Trust Controls to gain initial access and evade defenses.
   - After gaining access, they would likely use T1057 Process Discovery to gather information about the systems and networks they have compromised.
   - With this information, they can then use T1071 Application Layer Protocol to establish command and control over the compromised infrastructure.

Therefore, it is likely that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery before leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.
