 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes the TTPs of the XAgent app, which includes executing itself in the background, hiding its icon, and restarting when terminated on iOS 7 devices.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the XAgent app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns well with the TTPs described in the question. Malware often collects geo-location data as part of its discovery routine to help tailor its activities to the specific location of the infected device.
   - Answer choice B: No - This answer choice does not align with the TTPs described in the question. There is no reason to believe that the XAgent app would not collect geo-location data, especially given its stealthy nature and the need for the attacker to have knowledge of the device's location.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The XAgent app is described as executing itself in the background, hiding its icon, and restarting when terminated. These TTPs are common for malware that aims to remain undetected on a device.
   - Collecting geo-location data is a common tactic, used by many types of malware, to help the attacker understand the location of the infected device. This information can be used to tailor the malware's activities to the specific location.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the XAgent app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.
