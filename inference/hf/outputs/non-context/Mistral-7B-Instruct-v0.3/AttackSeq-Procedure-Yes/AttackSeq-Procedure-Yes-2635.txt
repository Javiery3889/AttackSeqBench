 Final Answer: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) performed by the Machete malware, which includes discovery, data collection (file listings and browser data), and communication with C2 servers via FTP and HTTP ports.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs in the question does not include screen capture as a part of the data collection phase. Screen capture is typically used for reconnaissance or maintaining persistence, not for data collection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question mentions that Machete malware performs discovery, data collection, and communication with C2 servers.
   - Data collection includes file listings and browser data, but not screen capture.
   - Screen capture is not mentioned as part of the data collection phase in the sequence described in the question.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that screen capture will be utilized before leveraging FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C2 servers.
