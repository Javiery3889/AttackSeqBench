 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect relevant data.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The MITRE ATT&CK framework lists "Lateral Movement" as a tactic that is often followed by "Persistence" to maintain access to the compromised system.
   - Installing further persistence points during lateral movement allows attackers to maintain access to the network and move freely, making it easier to collect relevant data in the future.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After discovering systems, users, and data relevant to the mission, attackers typically perform lateral movement to access other systems within the network (MITRE ATT&CK: Lateral Movement).
   - During this process, they may install further persistence points on these systems to maintain access for future activities (MITRE ATT&CK: Persistence).
   - Once persistence is established, attackers can then proceed to collect the relevant data (MITRE ATT&CK: Data Collection).

Therefore, it is likely that attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect the relevant data. The answer choice that aligns best with this sequence is "Yes".
