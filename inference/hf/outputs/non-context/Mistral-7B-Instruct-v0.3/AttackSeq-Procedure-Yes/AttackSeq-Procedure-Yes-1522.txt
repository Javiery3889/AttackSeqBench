 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes an attack where the attackers modified a Javascript file on a CDN server to deliver malicious code to targeted websites.
2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Option A suggests that the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer. This answer choice aligns well with the attack sequence described in the question, as obfuscation and encoding are common techniques used for defense evasion in such attacks.
   - Option B suggests that the attackers did not obfuscate the malicious code. This would be less likely, as obfuscation is often used to make the malicious code harder to detect and analyze.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario would be:
- Modify the Javascript file on the CDN server to deliver malicious code (Initial Attack)
- Obfuscate the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer (Defense Evasion)
