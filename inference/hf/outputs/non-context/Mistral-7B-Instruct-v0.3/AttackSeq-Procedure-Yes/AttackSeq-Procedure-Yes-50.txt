 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that involve evading defenses by operating in memory, using a specific DCOM object, and executing files without saving them to disk.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that a PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs described in the question are commonly associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) and malware such as Ursnif and GandCrab. These malware families are known to use memory-based evasion techniques, DCOM objects, and PowerShell scripts for command and control (C2) communication and payload delivery.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the tactics used by malware families such as Ursnif and GandCrab.
   - These malware families are known to use memory-based evasion techniques, DCOM objects, and PowerShell scripts for command and control (C2) communication and payload delivery.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
