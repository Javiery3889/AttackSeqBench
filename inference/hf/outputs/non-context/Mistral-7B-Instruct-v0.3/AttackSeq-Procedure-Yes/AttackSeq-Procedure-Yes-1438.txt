 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by ProjectM actors, which includes developing a custom toolset, registering domains, and conducting spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The question asks if it is likely that they gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access.

2. Compare and Evaluate: To answer this question, we need to consider the typical sequence of TTPs used in a cyber attack. Reconnaissance is often the first step in an attack, where the attacker gathers information about the target. In this case, gathering victim identity information would be a plausible reconnaissance activity before launching spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Reconnaissance is the initial phase of a cyber attack where the attacker gathers information about the target.
   - In this case, the ProjectM actors have developed a custom toolset and registered domains, which could be part of their reconnaissance efforts to prepare for the attack.
   - Gathering victim identity information would provide them with more targeted and effective spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
   - Therefore, it is likely that they gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
