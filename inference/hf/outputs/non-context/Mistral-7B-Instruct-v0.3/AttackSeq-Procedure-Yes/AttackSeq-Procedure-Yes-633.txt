 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving privilege escalation using the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll and subsequent communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - The question also mentions the resolution of a domain (psychology-blog.ezua[.]com) to the IP address of the C&C server (209.239.115[.]91).

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the shellcode will contact its C&C at the specified IP address and resolve the domain to the same IP address for further malicious activity. This aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the shellcode will not contact its C&C at the specified IP address or resolve the domain to the IP address. This does not align with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After privilege escalation, the attacker gains higher-level access to the compromised system.
   - The shellcode, which is a piece of code executed by the attacker, is then used to communicate with the C&C server for further instructions.
   - The question mentions that the shellcode will contact its C&C at the specified IP address (209.239.115[.]91).
   - The attacker may also need to resolve the domain (psychology-blog.ezua[.]com) to the IP address of the C&C server for communication. This is a common technique used in many types of malware to obfuscate the C&C server's location.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the shellcode will contact its C&C at the specified IP address and resolve the domain to the same IP address for further malicious activity.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: A: Yes. The shellcode will contact its C&C at https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ and resolve the domain psychology-blog.ezua[.]com to the IP address 209.239.115[.]91 for further malicious activity.
