 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by threat actors in phishing attacks on Solar Winds and Kaseya. The TTPs mentioned are:
   - Initial point of intrusion via phishing emails
   - Further phishing campaigns within a client's supply chain

2. Compare and Evaluate: To gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts is a common TTP used by threat actors to understand their targets better and plan their attacks more effectively. This TTP is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but it is a logical step in the sequence of TTPs described.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Threat actors have already gained initial access to a victim organization through phishing emails.
   - To further their attack, they are using phishing campaigns within the supply chain, which suggests they are expanding their reach within the targeted ecosystem.
   - Gathering victim organization information during reconnaissance efforts would help them understand the structure of the supply chain and identify potential targets for further attacks.
   - Therefore, it is likely that threat actors targeting Solar Winds and Kaseya cyber-attacks will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.
