 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes an attack sequence on the PCA website, starting with the exploitation of Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) for initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers used a dropper executable (Rdws.exe) for DLL sideloading and evaded defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - DLL sideloading is a technique where an attacker loads a malicious DLL into a legitimate process, which can be achieved by using a dropper executable like Rdws.exe.
   - Evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable is a common technique used by attackers to bypass security measures.
   - Given the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, it is plausible that the attackers used the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading and then deployed a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable to evade defenses.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence starts with the exploitation of the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, it is likely that the attackers used a dropper executable (Rdws.exe) to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process (DLL sideloading).
   - To evade defenses, the attackers may have deployed the malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
   - Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence in the question is "Yes".
