 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) from the FHAPPI campaign, which includes delivering a phishing email, using a VBScript to download and open a .doc file, and the malware being hosted on a Geocities website.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.
   - In many APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attacks, malware often uses multiple techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. One common technique is to use PowerShell for further execution, especially when the initial infection vector involves downloading and executing files.
   - The question mentions that the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file, which could potentially contain macros that lead to PowerShell execution. Macros can be used to execute PowerShell commands, and these commands can be base64 encoded to evade detection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file, which could contain macros.
   - If the .doc file contains macros, these macros could be designed to execute PowerShell commands.
   - PowerShell commands can be base64 encoded to evade detection.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.
