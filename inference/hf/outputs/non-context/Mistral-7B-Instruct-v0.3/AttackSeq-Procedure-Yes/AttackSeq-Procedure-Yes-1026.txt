 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes two TTPs (Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: Spearphishing Attachment; Tactic: Discovery, Technique: Command and Control (C2) Beacon) used by Gamaredon's malware. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will perform another TTP (Tactic: Collection, Technique: Data from Local System) to scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the malware will scan all drives for sensitive data, which aligns with the Tactic: Collection and Technique: Data from Local System.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the malware will not scan all drives for sensitive data, which contradicts the TTPs used by Gamaredon's malware, as they typically involve data collection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes the use of malicious macros and a backdoor, which are common TTPs used by Gamaredon's malware for initial access and discovery.
   - After gaining access and discovering the system, it is common for malware to collect data, including scanning drives for sensitive information. This is a standard TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

In conclusion, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment (malicious macros)
   - Discovery: Command and Control (C2) Beacon
   - Collection: Data from Local System (scanning drives for sensitive data)
