 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) involving a supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, delivering the Sunburst backdoor, and the potential for further exploitation through communication with a C2 server.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer Choice A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question. After gaining initial access through the supply-chain attack, the Sunburst backdoor would need to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions and continue the attack.
   - Answer Choice B: No - This answer choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs described in the question. If the Sunburst backdoor did not communicate with its C2 server, it would not be able to carry out further exploitation.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After compromising SolarWinds and delivering the Sunburst backdoor, the attackers would need a way to control the compromised systems for further exploitation.
   - One common TTP is for the backdoor to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server, which would allow the attackers to issue commands and receive data from the compromised systems.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server for further exploitation.

In conclusion, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the Sunburst backdoor communicating with its C2 server for further exploitation, making Answer Choice A the correct answer.
