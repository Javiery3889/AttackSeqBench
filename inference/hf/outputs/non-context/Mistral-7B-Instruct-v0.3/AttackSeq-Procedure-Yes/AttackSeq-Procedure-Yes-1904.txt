 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) where the Lampion trojan creates a .lnk file and a new VBS file for persistence at system startup.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The creation of a .lnk file and a VBS file for persistence is a common method used by malware to maintain access to a compromised system. However, this action does not necessarily imply that the malware will immediately communicate with a C2 server.

   However, the question asks about the likelihood of the malware communicating with a C2 server to send collected data using an application layer protocol for Command and Control purposes. This action is a common TTP used by many types of malware, including the Lampion trojan, to exfiltrate data and receive further instructions from the attacker.

   Therefore, it is likely that the Lampion trojan will communicate with a C2 server after achieving persistence.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Lampion trojan has achieved persistence by creating a .lnk file and a new VBS file.
   - Persistence is a common goal for malware, but it does not necessarily imply immediate communication with a C2 server.
   - However, the question asks about the likelihood of the malware communicating with a C2 server to send collected data using an application layer protocol for Command and Control purposes.
   - This action is a common TTP used by many types of malware, including the Lampion trojan, to exfiltrate data and receive further instructions from the attacker.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Lampion trojan will communicate with a C2 server after achieving persistence.
