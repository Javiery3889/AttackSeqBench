 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by FIN13, which includes dumping LSASS process memory and using passive backdoors for command execution.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Option A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. After dumping LSASS process memory and executing passive backdoors, FIN13 often exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks. This is a common tactic observed in their attack methodology.
   - Option B: No - This answer choice contradicts the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question. FIN13 does not typically skip the step of exploiting external servers and deploying web shells after dumping LSASS process memory and executing passive backdoors.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After FIN13 dumps LSASS process memory and executes passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, they typically establish persistence and command execution capabilities within the compromised system.
   - To maintain access and further penetrate the victim network, FIN13 often exploits external servers and deploys web shells. This allows them to execute commands remotely and move laterally within the network.
   - Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 will exploit external servers and deploy web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.
