 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the execution of commands from an encrypted file, infecting removable media, collecting system files, performing recursive directory listings, collecting system details, and cleaning up indicators of its presence by deleting key artifacts.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - Answer choice A suggests that the malware system would perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence. This aligns with the sequence of TTPs described in the question, as the malware first collects the necessary information and then cleans up its traces.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the malware would not perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence. This does not align with the sequence of TTPs described in the question, as the malware is shown to collect system details before cleaning up its traces.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs that involves the malware first infecting removable media and collecting system files. This suggests that the malware is gathering information about the system for further use.
   - After collecting system files, the malware performs recursive directory listings and collects system details. This is a common TTP used by malware to gather more information about the system, such as user accounts, network shares, and other valuable data.
   - Finally, the malware cleans up indicators of its presence by deleting key artifacts. This is a common TTP used by malware to avoid detection and analysis.
   - Therefore, the malware system is likely to perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up indicators of its presence.
