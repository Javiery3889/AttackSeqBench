 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question asks if RIG EK, a malware delivery platform, is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

2. Compare and Evaluate: RIG EK is known for using malvertising to deliver malware. It typically exploits browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines and obtain capabilities. Once it has these capabilities, it often redirects users to advertising pages or compromised websites as part of the malvertising process. This is done to further obfuscate its activities and increase the chances of successful infection.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines and obtain capabilities (Initial Access and Command & Control).
   - Step 2: RIG EK redirects users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising (Initial Access, Initial Foothold, and Delivery).
   - Step 3: RIG EK delivers its payload (Command & Control, Execution).

Given this sequence of TTPs, the most plausible answer is "Yes". RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.
