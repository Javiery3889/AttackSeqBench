 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CostaRicto Campaign, which includes protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication. The question then asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the CostaRicto Campaign has already established a secure C2 channel using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges. This is a common technique used by malware like SombRAT to secure their communication channels. Therefore, it is plausible that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over this secure C2 channel.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign has established a C2 channel using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - This C2 channel is secured using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.
   - SombRAT is a malware known to use secure communication channels for its operations.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over this secure C2 channel.

In conclusion, the answer is "Yes". The SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
