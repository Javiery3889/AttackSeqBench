 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the Collection phase where attackers use mobile applications loaded with spyware to collect sensitive information.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The Command and Control phase is where the attacker maintains communication with the compromised devices. One common method for this communication is through application layer protocols. Since the attackers have already collected the data, it is likely that they would use an application layer protocol to send the stolen data back to their infrastructure during the Command and Control phase.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attackers have collected sensitive data from victims' devices (Collection phase).
   - To maintain communication with the compromised devices, attackers typically use Command and Control (C2) servers (Command and Control phase).
   - One common method for C2 communication is through application layer protocols, as they can be more difficult to detect and block.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will send the stolen data back to their infrastructure over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase.

So, the answer is "Yes".
