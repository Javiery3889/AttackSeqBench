 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to an attack by The Inception attackers.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
     - Reconnaissance spear phish
     - Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882
     - Deployment of PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.
   - Spear phishing is often used as an initial step in an attack to gather information about the target. This information can be used to craft a malicious Microsoft Word document that exploits CVE-2017-11882, a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Word.
   - Once the exploit is successful, the attackers can execute their PowerShell backdoor, POWERSHOWER, for further activities such as command and control, data exfiltration, or lateral movement.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Step 1: The attackers perform reconnaissance spear phishing to gather information about their targets.
   - Step 2: The attackers create a malicious Microsoft Word document that exploits CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates.
   - Step 3: The target opens the malicious Word document, leading to the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882.
   - Step 4: The attackers deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities.

Therefore, it is likely that The Inception attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.
