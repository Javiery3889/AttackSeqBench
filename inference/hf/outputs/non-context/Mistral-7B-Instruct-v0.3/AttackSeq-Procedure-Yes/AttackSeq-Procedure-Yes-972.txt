 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) related to the Discovery phase (gathering system information) and the Collection phase (data collection activities like creating/deleting files, taking screenshots).

2. Compare and Evaluate: The Aria-body backdoor, after gathering system information during the Discovery phase, would likely continue with data collection activities as part of the Collection phase. This is because the purpose of a backdoor is to provide unauthorized access to a system, and once it has gained access, it would typically collect additional data to further its objectives.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The Aria-body backdoor has already performed Discovery TTPs (gathering system information, hostname, and public IP).
   - In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, after Discovery, the next logical step for an adversary is to move to the Collection phase to gather more data.
   - Data collection activities such as creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, etc., are common TTPs associated with the Collection phase.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Aria-body backdoor will proceed towards creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.
