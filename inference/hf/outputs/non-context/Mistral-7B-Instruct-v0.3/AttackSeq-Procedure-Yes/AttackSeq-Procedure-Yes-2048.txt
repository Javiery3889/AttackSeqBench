 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Charming Kitten created fake websites to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase. The question then asks if it is likely that they targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. Compare and Evaluate: The TTPs described in the question do not indicate any activity related to the Reconnaissance phase, specifically impersonating well-known researchers or journalists. The Resource Development phase is about gathering resources (e.g., credentials) for future operations, not about reconnaissance. Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers would immediately switch to the Reconnaissance phase targeting specific individuals without any evidence of such activity in the described sequence of TTPs.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Charming Kitten created fake websites to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that they targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - However, the sequence of TTPs does not indicate any activity related to the Reconnaissance phase, specifically impersonating well-known researchers or journalists. Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers would immediately switch to the Reconnaissance phase targeting specific individuals without any evidence of such activity in the described sequence of TTPs.
