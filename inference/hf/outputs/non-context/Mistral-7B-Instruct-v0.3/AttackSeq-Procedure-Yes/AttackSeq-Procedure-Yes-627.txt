 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the Question:
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the delivery of malware, execution of a VB Script, dropping and opening a decoy Microsoft Word file, and rewriting the malware to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the malware has already been dropped as an '.exe' file in the %Temp% folder.
   - Creating a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and maintain persistence on the compromised system.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question suggests that the malware has already been dropped as an '.exe' file in the %Temp% folder.
   - Creating a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and maintain persistence on the compromised system.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
