 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the Question: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) where the malware is gathering system information and process lists. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control operations.

2. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs described in the question do not indicate any use of HTTPS communication. Malware often uses HTTPS for command and control communication to maintain a secure and encrypted connection. However, the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not provide evidence of this.
   - The 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command is a common technique for gathering system information and process lists, but it does not inherently imply the use of HTTPS for command and control.

3. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware has been observed gathering system information and process lists, but there is no evidence in the provided TTPs that it will use HTTPS for command and control operations.
   - While malware can use various TTPs in different sequences, the sequence described in the question does not suggest the use of HTTPS for command and control.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control operations.
