### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Collection Phase:** Compressing proprietary data using WinRAR.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** Using custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employing cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Compressing data using WinRAR is a common technique to reduce the size of files and make them easier to exfiltrate. This is a plausible step in the Collection phase.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - **Custom Malware:** Custom malware can be used to automate the exfiltration process, making it more efficient and harder to detect. This is a plausible technique.
     - **Dropbox:** Dropbox is a common cloud storage service that attackers might use to exfiltrate data because it is widely trusted and easy to use.
     - **cURL for Windows:** cURL is a command-line tool that can be used to transfer data to and from a server. It is a common tool for exfiltration because it is lightweight and can be scripted easily.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. Compressing data, using custom malware to exfiltrate it to a cloud service like Dropbox, and employing a tool like cURL to upload the files are all common and effective techniques in the Exfiltration phase of a cyber attack.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
