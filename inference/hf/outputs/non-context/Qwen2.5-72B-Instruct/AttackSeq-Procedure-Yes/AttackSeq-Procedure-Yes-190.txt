### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - The question then asks if the attacker, specifically "Infamous Chisel," is likely to automatically exfiltrate these files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Infamous Chisel** is a known malware or tool used in cyber attacks. It is important to understand its typical behavior and capabilities.
   - **Exfiltration at Regular Intervals:** This is a common technique used by malware to ensure data is consistently and reliably transferred to the attacker's server.
   - **Tor Hidden Service:** Tor is often used to anonymize the exfiltration process, making it harder to trace the data back to the attacker.
   - **SSH Connections:** SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used for secure communication and file transfer. It is often used in exfiltration to ensure the data is encrypted and less likely to be intercepted.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Tor Hidden Service and SSH:** Using both Tor and SSH for exfiltration is a sophisticated approach. Tor provides anonymity, while SSH ensures secure and encrypted communication.
   - **Regular Intervals:** Automating the exfiltration process at regular intervals is a common tactic to ensure continuous data theft without manual intervention.
   - **Infamous Chisel's Capabilities:** While specific details about "Infamous Chisel" are not provided, it is reasonable to assume that a sophisticated malware or tool would use advanced techniques like Tor and SSH for exfiltration.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the described exfiltration process and the typical behavior of advanced malware, it is plausible that "Infamous Chisel" would use such a method.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
