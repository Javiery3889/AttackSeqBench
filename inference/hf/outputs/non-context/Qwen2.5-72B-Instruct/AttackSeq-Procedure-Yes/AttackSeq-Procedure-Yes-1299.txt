### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the execution of hidden objects in an Excel document exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attack will hide artifacts using T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories):** This technique involves hiding files and directories to evade detection. It is often used to conceal malicious files or directories that the attacker wants to keep on the system without being noticed.
   - **Credential Access:** This involves techniques for searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files. This is typically done to gain further access or to move laterally within the network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Initial Exploitation (CVE-2017-11882):** The attacker uses a known vulnerability to execute code silently.
     - **Hiding Artifacts (T1158):** After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to hide their tracks to avoid detection. This can include hiding files and directories.
     - **Credential Access:** Once the attacker has established a foothold and hidden their artifacts, they may then proceed to search for and extract credentials to gain further access or move laterally.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is highly plausible that an attacker would hide artifacts before searching for and extracting credentials. This is because hiding artifacts helps to maintain persistence and avoid detection, which is crucial for the success of the attack.
     - Hiding artifacts is a common step in the attack lifecycle, often occurring after initial access and before further actions like credential access.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack, it is likely that the attacker will hide artifacts using T1158 before searching for and extracting credentials.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
