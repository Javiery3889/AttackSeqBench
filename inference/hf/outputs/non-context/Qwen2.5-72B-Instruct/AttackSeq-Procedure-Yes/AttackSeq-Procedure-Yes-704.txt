### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor TA505.
   - The sequence involves hijacking the `RegIdleBackup` scheduled task and altering its COM handler to execute the FlawedGrace RAT for persistence.
   - The question asks whether TA505 is likely to encode the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64 strings within the registry as part of defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Hijacking the `RegIdleBackup` Scheduled Task:**
     - This is a known technique for achieving persistence. By hijacking a legitimate scheduled task, the attacker can ensure that their malware (in this case, FlawedGrace RAT) is executed regularly.
   - **Altering the COM Handler:**
     - This is another technique for persistence and execution. By modifying the COM handler, the attacker can ensure that the FlawedGrace RAT is loaded when the scheduled task runs.
   - **Encoding in Base64:**
     - Encoding the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64 strings within the registry is a common defense evasion technique. Base64 encoding can obfuscate the payload, making it harder for security tools to detect the malicious code.
   - **TA505's TTPs:**
     - TA505 is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. They have been observed using various obfuscation methods, including Base64 encoding, to hide their payloads.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that TA505 is known for using sophisticated defense evasion techniques and that Base64 encoding is a common method for obfuscating payloads, it is highly likely that they would encode the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64 strings within the registry.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
