### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Ensuring persistence by inserting malicious macros into existing documents.
     2. Leveraging template injection to add remote templates to documents for defense evasion.
     3. Utilizing backdoors to list interesting files on the system for future exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Malicious Macros:**
     - This is a common technique used by various threat actors, including Gamaredon, to ensure that their malware persists on the victim's system. Malicious macros can be embedded in Office documents and executed when the document is opened.
   - **Template Injection:**
     - Template injection is a technique where a remote template is added to a document, which can be used to download additional malicious content or to evade detection. This technique can be used to maintain persistence and to deliver additional payloads.
   - **Backdoor Utilization:**
     - Once persistence is established and the initial payload is delivered, threat actors often use backdoors to maintain access to the system. Listing interesting files is a common reconnaissance activity that helps the attacker identify valuable data for exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the known TTPs of the Gamaredon group:
     1. **Persistence via Malicious Macros:** This is a common initial step to ensure the malware remains on the system.
     2. **Template Injection:** This can be used to add remote templates, which can help in evading detection and delivering additional payloads.
     3. **Backdoor Utilization:** Once the system is compromised, the attacker can use backdoors to list files and prepare for exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the alignment with known Gamaredon TTPs, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
