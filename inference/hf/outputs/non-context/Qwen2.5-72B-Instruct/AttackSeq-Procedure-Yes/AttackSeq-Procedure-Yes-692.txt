### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Pierogi backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Activities:** Collecting system information such as computer name, username, and operating system version.
     - **Communication with C2 Servers:** Using predefined URLs to send machine information and receive commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the discovery activities, the backdoor is likely to communicate with C2 servers using predefined URLs.
     - This aligns with common malware behavior. After gathering system information, malware often needs to exfiltrate this data to a C2 server and receive further commands.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor is unlikely to communicate with C2 servers using predefined URLs.
     - This is less plausible because most backdoors and malware need to communicate with a C2 server to exfiltrate data and receive commands.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a typical attack pattern:
     - **Discovery:** The backdoor collects system information to understand the environment.
     - **C2 Communication:** The backdoor then communicates with a C2 server to send the collected information and receive further instructions.
   - This pattern is consistent with the behavior of many malware families, including the Pierogi backdoor.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
