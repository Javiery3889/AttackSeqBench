### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Agrius.
   - The sequence includes the use of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 (Command and Control) servers over HTTP.
   - The backdoor is used to perform actions such as updating relays or downloading files.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle', which later turned into functioning ransomware, to destroy data on targeted systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data on targeted systems.
     - Given the context, the use of a backdoor to communicate with C2 servers and perform various actions (like updating relays or downloading files) is a common precursor to more destructive activities.
     - Wipers and ransomware are often used in the final stages of an attack to either cover tracks or extort the victim.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data on targeted systems.
     - This choice would imply that Agrius's activities were limited to the initial stages of the attack and did not escalate to more destructive measures.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of a backdoor to communicate with C2 servers and perform various actions indicates a sophisticated and multi-stage attack.
   - It is common for threat actors to escalate their activities to more destructive measures, such as deploying wipers or ransomware, especially if the initial stages of the attack are successful.
   - The transformation of 'Apostle' from a wiper to functioning ransomware further supports the likelihood of such an escalation.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
