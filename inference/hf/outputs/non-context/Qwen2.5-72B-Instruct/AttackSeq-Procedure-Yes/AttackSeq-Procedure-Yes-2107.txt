### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Gathering detailed victim information such as hostname, OS details, user name, and MAC addresses.
     - **Data Collection:** Collecting screenshots.
     - **Command and Control (C&C) Communication:** Sending the collected data to a C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where the attacker gathers information about the victim's environment to plan further actions.
   - **Data Collection:** Collecting screenshots is a common technique used by backdoors and other malware to gather visual information about the victim's activities. This can provide valuable insights into the victim's behavior and environment.
   - **C&C Communication:** After collecting the data, the malware typically communicates with a C&C server to exfiltrate the data and receive further instructions.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     - **Discovery:** The attacker first gathers detailed information about the victim's system.
     - **Data Collection:** The backdoor then collects additional data, such as screenshots, to gain more insights.
     - **C&C Communication:** Finally, the collected data is sent to the C&C server for further analysis and to receive additional commands.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical flow and commonality of these TTPs in cyber attacks, it is likely that the backdoor will collect screenshots as part of its extensive data collection capabilities before communicating with the C&C server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
