### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement.
     - Sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents.
     - Given the context of the attack sequence, it is plausible that after gaining access to additional targets through lateral movement, the group would want to collect sensitive information.
     - Automating the process of scanning for sensitive documents is a common and efficient technique used by advanced threat actors to maximize their data exfiltration efforts.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is unlikely the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents.
     - While it is possible that the group might not automate this process, it is less likely given the sophistication and efficiency typically associated with advanced threat actors like Gamaredon.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes the deployment of scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of the collection activities.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
