### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the VERMIN malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting system information using WMI queries.
     - Using a keylogger to collect keystrokes and clipboard data.
     - Storing the collected data encrypted in a specific folder.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the keylogger component will indeed collect keystrokes and clipboard data and store them encrypted in the specified folder.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of malware that collects system information and then proceeds to gather more sensitive data using keyloggers.
     - Storing the data in an encrypted format and in a specific folder (e.g., `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`) is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure the data remains secure.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the keylogger component will not collect keystrokes and clipboard data and store them in the specified folder.
     - This would be less likely given the context of the question, as it would be unusual for malware to collect system information and then not follow up with more detailed data collection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible answer is that the keylogger component will collect keystrokes and clipboard data and store them encrypted in the specified folder.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
