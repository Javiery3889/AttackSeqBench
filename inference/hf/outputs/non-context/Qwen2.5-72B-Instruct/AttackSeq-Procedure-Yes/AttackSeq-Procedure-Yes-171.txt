### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware 'Surtr'.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Discovering file directories and contents.
     - Creating folders for storing temporary information (e.g., file listings and keylogger output).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that after the initial steps, 'Surtr' will connect to a C2 server and download a stage two component to a specific directory.
     - This is a common sequence in malware operations. After gathering initial information and setting up temporary storage, malware often connects to a C2 server to download additional components or receive further instructions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that 'Surtr' will not connect to a C2 server and download a stage two component.
     - This is less likely because malware typically needs to communicate with a C2 server to receive updates, additional payloads, or commands.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** 'Surtr' discovers file directories and contents.
   - **Step 2:** 'Surtr' creates folders for storing temporary information.
   - **Step 3:** It is logical for 'Surtr' to then connect to a C2 server to download additional components or receive further instructions.
   - **Step 4:** Downloading a stage two component is a common next step in malware operations to enhance its capabilities or perform more advanced tasks.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
