### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the GreyEnergy group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini.
     - Using Nmap to map the network.
     - Using Mimikatz to collect credentials.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Compromising a Computer:**
     - GreyEnergy mini is a known malware used by the GreyEnergy group to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Network Mapping:**
     - Nmap is a widely used tool for network scanning and mapping. It helps attackers understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **Credential Collection:**
     - Mimikatz is a powerful tool for extracting credentials from memory, which is a common technique used by attackers to gain additional access.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - SysInternals PsExec and WinExe are both tools that can be used for lateral movement. PsExec is a command-line utility that allows users to execute processes on other systems, and WinExe is a tool that allows remote execution of commands on Windows systems.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that the GreyEnergy group has already compromised a system, mapped the network, and collected credentials, it is highly likely that they would use these credentials to move laterally within the network.
     - PsExec and WinExe are common tools used for this purpose, and their use aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like the GreyEnergy group.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described and the common practices of advanced threat actors, it is highly likely that the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
