### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a multi-stage attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - A malicious macro that downloads and executes a second-stage downloader.
     - The second-stage downloader fetches an encrypted third-stage payload.
     - The question then asks if Lokibot is likely to escalate privileges by injecting a malicious DLL into Notepad.exe before employing process hollowing to bypass User Account Control (UAC).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lokibot** is a well-known information-stealing malware. It typically focuses on stealing sensitive information such as credentials, financial data, and other valuable data.
   - **Privilege Escalation Techniques:**
     - **DLL Injection:** This technique involves injecting a malicious DLL into a legitimate process to gain elevated privileges or to execute malicious code in the context of the target process.
     - **Process Hollowing:** This technique involves creating a new process in a suspended state, replacing its memory with malicious code, and then resuming the process to execute the malicious code.
     - **UAC Bypass:** This technique involves bypassing User Account Control to gain elevated privileges without the user's explicit consent.

   - **Lokibot's Behavior:**
     - Lokibot is known to use various techniques to steal information, but it is not typically associated with complex privilege escalation techniques like DLL injection into Notepad.exe or process hollowing to bypass UAC.
     - Lokibot often relies on simpler methods to achieve its goals, such as using built-in Windows tools or exploiting vulnerabilities in software to gain access to sensitive data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical behavior of Lokibot and the complexity of the described privilege escalation techniques, it is unlikely that Lokibot would use such advanced methods in the described sequence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
