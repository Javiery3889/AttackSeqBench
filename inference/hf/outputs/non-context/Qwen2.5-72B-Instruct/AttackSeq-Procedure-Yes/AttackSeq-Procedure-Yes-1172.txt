### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a threat actor might use.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.
     2. Deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
     3. Using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access in compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Vulnerability Scanning:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. Threat actors use vulnerability scanners to identify weaknesses in target systems.
   - **Deploying Public Exploits:**
     - Once vulnerabilities are identified, it is logical for the threat actor to use known exploits to gain initial access to the target systems.
   - **Using Stolen Credentials:**
     - After gaining initial access, threat actors often attempt to escalate privileges and maintain persistent access. One common method is to steal credentials from the compromised system and use them to move laterally or maintain access.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Vulnerability Scanning** to identify weaknesses.
     2. **Deploying Public Exploits** to exploit those weaknesses and gain initial access.
     3. **Using Stolen Credentials** to maintain persistent access and potentially move laterally within the network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns observed in the wild.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
