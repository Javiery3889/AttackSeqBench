### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     - **Initial Action:** Shellcode initiates a process to load a DLL using `LdrLoadDll`.
     - **Execution Phase:** The shellcode decrypts a payload using the AES128 encryption algorithm and executes it.
     - **Defense Evasion Phase:** The question asks if it is likely that the malware will hook its main function (`DllMain`) to evade detection by obfuscating its presence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - **Reasoning:** Hooking the `DllMain` function is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. By hooking `DllMain`, the malware can control the execution flow and potentially hide its presence or manipulate the environment to avoid detection by security tools. This is a plausible step in the defense evasion phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - **Reasoning:** If the malware does not hook `DllMain`, it might be more detectable by security tools. However, this does not mean it is impossible, but it is less likely given the context of the question, which suggests a sophisticated attack sequence.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the attack sequence described (shellcode, DLL loading, and AES128 decryption), it is highly likely that the malware would take additional steps to evade detection, such as hooking `DllMain`.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
