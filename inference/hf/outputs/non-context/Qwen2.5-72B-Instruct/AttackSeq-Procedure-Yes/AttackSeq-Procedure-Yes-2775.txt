### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dragonfly group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Defense Evasion:** Using self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence.
     - **Discovery:** Gathering system information on Windows systems.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally among internal or external systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Self-deleting code):**
     - This is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to avoid detection and forensic analysis. It aligns with the Dragonfly group's known capabilities.
   - **Discovery (Gathering system information):**
     - After evading defenses, it is logical for an attacker to gather information about the system to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - **Lateral Movement (Using RDP):**
     - RDP is a common method for lateral movement, especially in Windows environments. It allows attackers to access and control other systems within the network.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible:
     - **Defense Evasion** is often the first step to avoid detection.
     - **Discovery** follows to understand the environment and identify targets.
     - **Lateral Movement** is then used to spread the attack and gain access to more systems.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the known tactics of the Dragonfly group, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
