### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elderwood Project attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying zero-day exploits.
     - Gaining initial access via watering hole attacks.
     - Establishing command and control (C&C) servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will establish C&C servers after gaining initial access.
     - This is a common and logical next step in many cyber attack sequences. Once initial access is gained, attackers often set up C&C infrastructure to maintain control and execute further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not establish C&C servers.
     - This is less likely because maintaining control over compromised systems is crucial for the success of many cyber operations. Without C&C, the attackers would have limited ability to execute further commands or exfiltrate data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** The attackers use zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks. This is a known and effective method for compromising target systems.
   - **Step 2:** After gaining initial access, the attackers need a way to maintain control over the compromised systems. Establishing C&C servers is a standard and effective method to achieve this.
   - **Step 3:** C&C servers allow the attackers to send commands, receive data, and manage the compromised systems remotely, which is essential for the success of the attack.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
