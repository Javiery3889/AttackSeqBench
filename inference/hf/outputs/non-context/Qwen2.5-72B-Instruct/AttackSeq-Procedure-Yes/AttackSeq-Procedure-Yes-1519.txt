### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a malware called ComboJack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Ensuring persistence by setting a registry key.
     - Hiding itself using `attrib.exe`.
     - Entering an infinite loop to check clipboard contents for wallet information.
     - Replacing legitimate wallet addresses with a hardcoded wallet address.
     - Attempting to redirect funds to the attacker.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Setting a Registry Key):**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. It aligns with the initial step of ensuring persistence.
   - **Hiding (Using `attrib.exe`):**
     - Malware often uses various techniques to hide its presence, and `attrib.exe` is a common tool to change file attributes, making the malware less visible to users and security software.
   - **Infinite Loop to Check Clipboard:**
     - This is a specific behavior of clipboard hijackers, which are a type of malware that monitor the clipboard for specific data (like cryptocurrency wallet addresses) and replace them with the attacker's address.
   - **Replacing Wallet Addresses:**
     - This is a common tactic used by clipboard hijackers to steal cryptocurrency by redirecting transactions to the attacker's wallet.
   - **Redirecting Funds:**
     - The final step in the sequence is the actual theft of funds, which is the ultimate goal of such malware.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and logical sequence of TTPs for a clipboard hijacker like ComboJack. Each step builds upon the previous one, ensuring the malware remains persistent, hidden, and effective in its primary goal of stealing cryptocurrency.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
