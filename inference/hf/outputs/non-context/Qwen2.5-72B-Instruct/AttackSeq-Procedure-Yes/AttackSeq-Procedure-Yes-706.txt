### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that APT12 might use after deploying updated versions of their malware, Aumlib and Ixeshe.
   - The TTPs mentioned include:
     - **Execution Phase:** Deploying updated versions of Aumlib and Ixeshe.
     - **Defense Evasion:** Encoding the HTTP POST body of Aumlib and using a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Connecting to specific URLs such as `status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT12 will indeed attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib and use a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe as part of defense evasion before connecting to the specified URL.
     - This aligns with common TTPs used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to evade detection and maintain persistence.
     - Encoding and using different encoding patterns are typical techniques used to obfuscate network traffic and avoid signature-based detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT12 will not attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib or use a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe.
     - This is less likely given the sophisticated nature of APT12 and their known use of advanced evasion techniques.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - APT12 is known for using sophisticated TTPs to evade detection and maintain persistence.
     - Encoding the HTTP POST body and using different encoding patterns are common techniques to obfuscate network traffic and avoid detection by security systems.
     - The specified URL `status[.]acmetoy[.]com/DD/myScript.js` suggests a command and control (C2) communication, which is a critical phase in the attack lifecycle.
     - Given the advanced nature of APT12, it is highly likely that they would employ such techniques to ensure their malware remains undetected and can communicate with their C2 servers effectively.
   - **Conclusion:**
     - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT12 will indeed attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib and use a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe as part of defense evasion before connecting to the specified URL.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
