### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elise malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Injecting `NavShExt.dll` into the Internet Explorer process.
     - Creating a mutex named `donotbotherme` to prevent duplicate executions.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Elise will then employ defense evasion techniques such as heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation while exfiltrating data to the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Injecting `NavShExt.dll` into the Internet Explorer process:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to gain persistence and execute code in the context of a trusted process. It is a form of process injection.
   - **Creating a mutex named `donotbotherme`:**
     - Mutexes are often used by malware to ensure that only one instance of the malware is running at a time, which can help avoid detection and reduce resource consumption.
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - **Anti-virtual-machine (AVM) features:** Malware often includes AVM features to detect and avoid analysis in virtualized environments, which are commonly used by security researchers.
     - **Obfuscation:** Malware frequently uses obfuscation techniques to make its code and behavior harder to analyze and understand.
   - **Exfiltrating data to the C2 server:**
     - Data exfiltration is a common goal of malware, and it often involves sending stolen data to a command and control (C2) server.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Elise has already employed sophisticated techniques such as process injection and mutex creation, it is highly likely that it will also use defense evasion techniques to avoid detection and analysis.
   - Malware that is sophisticated enough to inject code into a process and manage its execution is often designed to evade detection and analysis, which includes using AVM features and obfuscation.
   - Exfiltrating data to a C2 server is a common final step in many malware attack sequences, and it is logical that the malware would use additional techniques to protect this critical phase of the attack.
