### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Sednit group (also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, or Sofacy).
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Gaining initial access through spearphishing emails.
     - **Stage-1 Downloader:** Using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader.
     - **Persistence:** Employing COM object hijacking for persistence by adding custom registry keys.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (Spearphishing):**
     - Sednit is known for using spearphishing emails to gain initial access to target systems. This is a common and well-documented TTP for this group.
   - **Stage-1 Downloader:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for advanced threat actors to use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute additional malware. This helps in maintaining a low profile and evading detection.
   - **Persistence (COM Object Hijacking):**
     - COM object hijacking is a technique used to maintain persistence by modifying the registry to ensure that malicious code is executed when certain system components are loaded. This is a sophisticated technique that aligns with the capabilities of the Sednit group.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the known TTPs of the Sednit group:
     - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails are a common entry point.
     - **Stage-1 Downloader:** Downloading and executing a new downloader is a typical next step to establish a foothold.
     - **Persistence:** Using COM object hijacking for persistence is a sophisticated technique that fits the profile of an advanced threat actor like Sednit.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
