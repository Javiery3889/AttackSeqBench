### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving a backdoor named `FinalBot.exe` that was extracted and renamed to `Srvstr.exe`.
   - It then asks if Sidewinder is likely to use an HTA (HTML Application) file to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system before communicating this information to the C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Backdoor Execution and Renaming:**
     - The backdoor `FinalBot.exe` is extracted and renamed to `Srvstr.exe`. This is a common tactic to avoid detection by security software, as the renamed file may not be recognized as malicious.
   - **Sidewinder and HTA File:**
     - Sidewinder is a known malware family that often uses various techniques to gather information about the victim's system, including the presence of security software.
     - HTA files are often used in malware campaigns to execute scripts and gather system information. They can be used to run VBScript or JScript, which can query the system for installed software, including antivirus products.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:**
     - Once the information is gathered, it is typical for malware to communicate this data back to the C2 server. This allows the attacker to understand the victim's environment and plan further actions.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that Sidewinder is known to gather system information and HTA files are a common method for executing scripts to gather such information, it is plausible that Sidewinder would use an HTA file to discover installed antivirus products.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question aligns with typical malware behavior, where the malware first establishes a foothold, gathers information, and then communicates this information back to the C2 server.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
