### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SideCopy malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging during the collection phase.
     - Targeting Kavach and using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - File enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging are common techniques used during the collection phase to gather information and credentials from the victim's system.
   - **Credential Access Tactic:**
     - The credential access tactic involves techniques to steal credentials, such as passwords, keys, and authentication tokens.
     - Targeting Kavach, a specific security software, and using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases aligns with the goal of credential access.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Modular Plugins:**
     - SideCopy is known for its modular nature, where it can deploy various plugins to perform different tasks.
     - The use of file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging plugins during the collection phase is consistent with SideCopy's behavior.
   - **Targeting Kavach:**
     - Kavach is a security software, and targeting it to exfiltrate authentication databases is a logical step in the credential access phase.
     - Using GoLang-based file recon plugins is a specific and sophisticated technique that aligns with the advanced nature of SideCopy.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression from collection to credential access, which is a common attack pattern.
