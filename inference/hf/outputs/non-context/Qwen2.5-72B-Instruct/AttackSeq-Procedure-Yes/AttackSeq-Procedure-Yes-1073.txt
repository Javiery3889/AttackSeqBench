### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through watering hole tactics.
   - The initial access exploits CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - After gaining initial access, custom shellcode is executed to download and run a PowerShell loader.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Watering hole tactics are a common method for initial access, where attackers compromise a website that the target is likely to visit.
     - Exploiting CVE-2020-0674 (a vulnerability in Microsoft Office) and CVE-2019-5782 (a vulnerability in Adobe Flash) can provide the initial foothold.
   - **Execution of Custom Shellcode:**
     - Once the initial access is achieved, custom shellcode is used to download and run a PowerShell loader. This is a common technique to maintain persistence and execute further commands.
   - **PowerShell Loader:**
     - A PowerShell loader is often used to execute additional payloads, such as backdoors, without writing to the disk, which can help evade detection.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation is a common next step in an attack sequence. Attackers often use backdoors to gain higher privileges, such as system privileges, to maintain control and perform more advanced actions.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the attackers will use the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation. This is a common and logical next step in an attack to gain more control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
