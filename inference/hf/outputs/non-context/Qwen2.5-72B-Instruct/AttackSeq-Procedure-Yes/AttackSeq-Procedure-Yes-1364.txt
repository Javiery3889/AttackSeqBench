### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where attackers first monitor targets via benign emails to understand their click habits and email click rates.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use social media mobile apps to steal identifiable information such as contact lists, emails, and SMS contents during their reconnaissance activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance via Benign Emails:**
     - This is a common technique used in the early stages of an attack to gather information about the target's behavior and preferences. It helps attackers tailor their phishing emails or other social engineering tactics to increase the likelihood of success.
   - **Using Social Media Mobile Apps for Further Reconnaissance:**
     - Social media mobile apps can be a rich source of personal and professional information. Attackers can use these apps to gather additional data about the target, such as contact lists, emails, and SMS contents.
     - This information can be used to create more convincing phishing emails or to identify additional targets within the same organization.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that the attackers have already shown a willingness to use benign emails to gather information, it is plausible that they would extend their reconnaissance efforts to other sources, including social media mobile apps, to gather more comprehensive data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that attackers who have already used benign emails to monitor click habits would also use social media mobile apps to steal identifiable information during their reconnaissance activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
