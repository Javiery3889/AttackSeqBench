### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Freakyshelly attackers.
   - The sequence involves gaining initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails.
   - It also mentions a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access through OLE2 Format Documents:**
     - OLE2 (Object Linking and Embedding) format documents can contain embedded objects, such as links or macros, which can be used to execute malicious code when opened.
     - This is a common technique used in spear phishing attacks to gain initial access to a victim's system.
   - **Microsoft Word Sending a GET Request:**
     - This technique involves using a feature in Microsoft Word to send a GET request to a remote server. This can be used for reconnaissance to gather information about the victim's system, such as the version of software installed.
     - This is a plausible technique for reconnaissance, as it allows attackers to gather information before launching a more targeted attack.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with known TTPs:
     - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers use a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to gather information about the victim's system.
     - **Initial Access:** The attackers then use this information to craft a spear phishing email with an OLE2 format document containing embedded links.
     - **Execution:** When the victim opens the document, the embedded links can be used to execute malicious code, allowing the attackers to gain initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the alignment with known attack patterns, the most plausible answer is that the Freakyshelly attackers would indeed use this sequence of techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
