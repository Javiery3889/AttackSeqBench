### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question involves the APT28/Sofacy group and their use of the 'Komplex' and 'XAgent' malware.
   - The specific sequence in question is whether the Komplex Binder saves and executes a second payload before the XAgent component checks for the presence of a debugger.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Komplex Binder:**
     - The Komplex Binder is a component of the Komplex malware that is known for its ability to bind a legitimate file with a malicious payload. This binding technique is often used to evade detection by making the malicious file appear as a legitimate one.
     - Once the bound file is executed, the Komplex Binder typically saves and executes the second payload (the malicious component) on the system.
   - **XAgent:**
     - XAgent is a sophisticated malware used by APT28/Sofacy. It is known for its various capabilities, including anti-debugging techniques to evade detection.
     - One of the anti-debugging techniques used by XAgent is checking for the presence of a debugger. This is typically done to ensure that the malware is not being analyzed in a controlled environment.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The Komplex Binder's primary function is to save and execute a second payload. This payload is often the XAgent malware.
   - Once the XAgent malware is executed, it then performs its own set of actions, including checking for the presence of a debugger.
   - Therefore, the logical sequence is that the Komplex Binder would first save and execute the XAgent payload, and then the XAgent component would perform its anti-debugging checks.
