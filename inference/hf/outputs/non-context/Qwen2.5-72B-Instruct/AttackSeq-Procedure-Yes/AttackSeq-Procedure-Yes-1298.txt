### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker is expected to steal stored passwords and access tokens using techniques like Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2017-11882**: This is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows for remote code execution without user interaction. It is often used as an initial access vector.
   - **Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry**: These techniques are used to extract credentials from the system, which can be used to gain further access or move laterally within the network.
   - **T1107 (File Deletion)**: This technique involves deleting files to remove evidence of the attack, which is a common method of defense evasion.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access**: The attacker gains initial access using CVE-2017-11882.
   - **Credential Harvesting**: The attacker then uses Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry to steal stored passwords and access tokens.
   - **Defense Evasion**: After stealing credentials, it is common for attackers to engage in activities to cover their tracks and avoid detection. T1107 (File Deletion) is a typical technique used for this purpose. By deleting files, the attacker can remove logs, temporary files, or other evidence that might indicate the presence of the attack.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion to cover their tracks after stealing credentials.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
