### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the XAgent app on iOS devices.
   - The TTPs include:
     - Collecting data (text messages, contact lists, geo-location information).
     - Exfiltrating the collected data via HTTP requests.
     - Communicating with a C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Using a Base64 encoded token for identification.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Data Collection:** It is common for malware to collect various types of data from infected devices, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location information.
       - **Exfiltration via HTTP:** Malware often uses HTTP requests to exfiltrate data because HTTP is a widely used protocol and can blend in with normal traffic.
       - **C&C Communication:** Malware typically communicates with a C&C server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
       - **Base64 Encoding:** Using Base64 encoding for tokens is a common technique to obfuscate data and make it harder to detect or tamper with.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - There is no strong evidence or logical reason to believe that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely. The techniques mentioned are consistent with known malware behaviors.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with known malware behaviors and is therefore likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
