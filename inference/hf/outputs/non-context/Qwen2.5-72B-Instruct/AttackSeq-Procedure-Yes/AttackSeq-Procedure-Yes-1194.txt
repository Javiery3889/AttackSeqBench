### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the BlackEnergy Trojan.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Ensuring persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder.
     - The LNK file executes a command: `rundll32.exe "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT",#1`.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will connect to a hardcoded C&C (Command and Control) server at `5.149.254[.]114` on port 80 to issue an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - Creating a LNK file in the system startup folder is a common persistence technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system boots.
     - The command `rundll32.exe "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT",#1` is a known method to execute a malicious DLL, which is often used by malware to maintain persistence and perform other malicious activities.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Malware often communicates with a C&C server to receive commands, exfiltrate data, or update its configuration.
     - The use of a hardcoded C&C server IP address and port 80 (HTTP) is a common technique to establish communication.
     - Sending an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information is a typical method for malware to exfiltrate data to the C&C server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The persistence mechanism described (creating a LNK file in the startup folder) is consistent with the behavior of the BlackEnergy Trojan.
   - The command `rundll32.exe "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT",#1` is a known method for executing a malicious DLL, which is often used by malware like BlackEnergy.
   - The C&C communication described (HTTP POST request to a hardcoded IP address with BASE64-encoded data) is a common technique used by malware to communicate with its C&C server.
   - Given the known behavior of the BlackEnergy Trojan, it is highly likely that after ensuring persistence, it would attempt to communicate with its C&C server to send victim information.
