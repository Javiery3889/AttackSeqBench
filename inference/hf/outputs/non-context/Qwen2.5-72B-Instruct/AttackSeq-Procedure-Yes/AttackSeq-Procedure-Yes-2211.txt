### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the threat actor, Earth Lusca, uses tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan to scan for open ports and shared folders during the discovery phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will use protocol tunneling during the command and control (C2) phase to establish communication with compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Scanning for open ports and shared folders is a common technique used in the discovery phase to gather information about the target network and identify potential entry points.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - Protocol tunneling is a technique used to encapsulate one protocol within another to bypass network security measures and establish a covert communication channel.
     - This technique is often used in the C2 phase to maintain persistent and stealthy communication with compromised systems.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Earth Lusca has already performed discovery activities to identify open ports and shared folders, it is logical to assume that they would use advanced techniques to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - Protocol tunneling is a sophisticated method that can help evade detection and maintain a stable communication channel, which is crucial for the C2 phase.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that Earth Lusca would use protocol tunneling during the C2 phase to establish and maintain communication with the compromised systems.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
