### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that CosmicDuke might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Searching removable drives.
     - Skipping certain file types during collection.
     - Using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information.
     - Exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Searching Removable Drives:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to find and collect sensitive information from removable storage devices.
   - **Skipping Certain File Types During Collection:**
     - Malware often has filters to avoid collecting certain file types that are not of interest or that might trigger security alerts.
   - **Using a Keylogger, Screenshotter, and Clipboard Stealer:**
     - These are typical data collection techniques used by malware to gather a wide range of information from the victim's system.
   - **Exfiltrating Data via FTP:**
     - FTP is a common method for exfiltrating data, especially in older or less sophisticated malware.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - CosmicDuke is a known piece of malware that has been associated with a variety of data collection and exfiltration techniques.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the known capabilities of CosmicDuke, which includes searching for files, using various data collection methods, and exfiltrating data.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
