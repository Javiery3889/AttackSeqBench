### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence starts with achieving credential access using the Responder tool to harvest login credentials.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group will proceed with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC before conducting discovery activities such as network share discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (Responder Tool):**
     - The Responder tool is commonly used to capture network credentials, particularly through techniques like NTLM relay attacks.
   - **Lateral Movement (Windows commands and WMIC):**
     - Once credentials are obtained, attackers often use these credentials to move laterally within the network. Windows commands and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) are common tools for this purpose.
   - **Discovery (Network Share Discovery):**
     - After gaining access to additional systems, attackers typically perform discovery activities to understand the network environment better. This includes identifying network shares, available systems, and other resources.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The logical sequence of TTPs in a typical attack would be:
       1. **Credential Access:** Harvesting credentials using tools like Responder.
       2. **Lateral Movement:** Using the harvested credentials to move to other systems within the network.
       3. **Discovery:** Conducting discovery activities to understand the network environment and identify valuable targets.
   - **Lazarus Group Behavior:**
     - The Lazarus group is known for sophisticated and methodical attacks. They often follow a structured approach to ensure they can maintain access and achieve their objectives.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is highly plausible that the Lazarus group would follow this sequence because it aligns with their known tactics and the logical progression of an attack.

### Final Answer:
