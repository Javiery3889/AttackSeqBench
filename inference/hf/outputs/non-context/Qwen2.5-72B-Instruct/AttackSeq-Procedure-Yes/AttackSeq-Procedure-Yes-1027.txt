### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Using backdoors to list interesting files on a system for future exfiltration.
     2. Using malware to take screenshots every minute.
     3. Employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (C2).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Backdoors for Listing Files:**
     - This is a common TTP for initial access and reconnaissance. Backdoors are often used to maintain persistence and gather information about the target system.
   - **Malware for Taking Screenshots:**
     - Taking screenshots every minute is a more aggressive and resource-intensive TTP. It is typically used for continuous monitoring and to gather real-time information about the user's activities.
   - **HTTP and HTTPS for C2:**
     - Using HTTP and HTTPS for C2 is a common technique to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The first step (using backdoors to list files) is a logical initial step for reconnaissance and data gathering.
     - The second step (taking screenshots every minute) is a more advanced and continuous monitoring technique. It is less common to see this immediately after the initial reconnaissance phase, as it can be more detectable and resource-intensive.
     - The third step (using HTTP and HTTPS for C2) is a standard technique for maintaining communication with the attacker's server.

   - **Gamaredon Group's TTPs:**
     - The Gamaredon group is known for using a variety of TTPs, including backdoors and C2 communication. However, the specific technique of taking screenshots every minute is not a commonly reported TTP for this group. It is more likely that they would use more subtle and less resource-intensive methods for continuous monitoring.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence described, it is less likely that Gamaredon would use malware to take screenshots every minute immediately after listing files for exfiltration. This step seems out of place and less plausible in the context of their known TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No
