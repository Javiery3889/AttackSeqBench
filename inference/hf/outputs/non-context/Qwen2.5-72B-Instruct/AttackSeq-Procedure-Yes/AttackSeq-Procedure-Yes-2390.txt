### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of discovery activities performed by the TDrop2 malware, including collecting system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that TDrop2 will communicate with C2 (Command and Control) servers using an encrypted channel after performing these discovery activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Collecting system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings are common initial steps in a cyber attack. These activities help the attacker understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - After gathering information, it is common for malware to communicate with C2 servers to exfiltrate data, receive further instructions, or maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Use of Encrypted Channels:**
     - Using encrypted channels for C2 communication is a common practice in modern malware to avoid detection by network security tools. Encrypted communication makes it more difficult for security systems to inspect and block the traffic.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that TDrop2 is performing discovery activities, it is likely that it will need to communicate with C2 servers to report the collected information and receive further instructions.
   - To avoid detection, it is highly probable that TDrop2 will use an encrypted channel for this communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
