### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a backdoor that steals Google Chrome credentials.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will ping the C2 (Command and Control) server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types (doc, docx, and pdf) to the same server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP Sequence Analysis:**
     - **Stealing Google Chrome Credentials:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, often used to gain access to user accounts and sensitive information.
     - **Pinging the C2 Server at Regular Intervals:** This is a typical behavior of malware to maintain communication with the attacker's server, ensuring that the malware can receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - **Collecting and Uploading Targeted File Types:** This is a common exfiltration technique where the malware searches for and uploads specific file types that are likely to contain valuable information.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is highly plausible that after stealing credentials, the backdoor would ping the C2 server to establish and maintain a communication channel.
     - Once the communication channel is established, the backdoor can receive further commands, such as instructions to collect and upload specific file types.
     - The sequence of pinging the C2 server before collecting and uploading files is a logical and common sequence in many malware operations.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
