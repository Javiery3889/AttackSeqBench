### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the WINDSHIFT APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence starts with the **Reconnaissance** phase, where the group uses social media platforms for long-term monitoring and tracking via benign emails and tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will use **Credential Access** techniques such as sending emails mimicking legitimate password recovery pages or using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages with HTTPS and free SSL certificates.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The use of social media platforms for long-term monitoring and tracking via benign emails and tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com is a common technique in the Reconnaissance phase. This helps the attackers gather information about their targets and understand their behavior.
   - **Credential Access Phase:**
     - Sending emails that mimic legitimate password recovery pages is a common technique used to trick victims into revealing their credentials. This is a well-known method in the Credential Access phase.
     - Using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages is another technique used to gain access to victim credentials. The use of HTTPS with free SSL certificates can make these landing pages appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood of success.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the context of the Reconnaissance phase and the typical follow-up actions in the Credential Access phase, it is highly plausible that WINDSHIFT APT would use these techniques to gain access to credentials.
   - The use of HTTPS with free SSL certificates is a common practice to make phishing sites appear more legitimate and trustworthy.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
