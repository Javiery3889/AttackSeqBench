### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT-TOCS gains initial access using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory without being written to the hard disk.
   - Finally, it mentions that the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access with `powershell.exe`:**
     - Using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts is a common technique for gaining initial access. PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment that can be used to execute code directly in memory.
   - **Execution in Memory:**
     - Shellcode is often executed in memory to avoid detection by file-based security solutions. This technique is known as "fileless" or "in-memory" execution.
     - Fileless execution is a common tactic used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Multi-Beacon Communication:**
     - After gaining initial access and executing the Shellcode in memory, attackers often use multi-beacon communication to maintain control and evade detection. This involves sending periodic signals to the command and control (C2) server to check for new commands or data exfiltration tasks.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. APT groups often use fileless techniques to execute code in memory to avoid leaving traces on the disk, which can help them evade detection by security solutions.
   - The use of multi-beacon communication for defense evasion is a common follow-up step after gaining initial access and executing the payload in memory.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
