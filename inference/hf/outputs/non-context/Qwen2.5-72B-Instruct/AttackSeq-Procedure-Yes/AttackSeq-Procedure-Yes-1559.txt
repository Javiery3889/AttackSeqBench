### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with an Initial Access tactic through a supply chain attack targeting the update mechanism of NoxPlayer.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attack campaign Operation NightScout will execute a malicious MFC Dialog application that uses overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory.
   - Finally, it asks if the attack will employ defense evasion techniques such as manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Supply Chain Attack:**
     - Supply chain attacks are a common Initial Access tactic where attackers compromise a trusted third-party software or update mechanism to deliver malware. This is a plausible first step.
   - **Execution of Malicious MFC Dialog Application:**
     - MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class) Dialog applications are often used in malware to create user interfaces. Using overlay data to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory is a sophisticated technique that can be used to evade detection and maintain stealth.
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - Manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions is a well-known defense evasion technique. It allows the malware to load and execute code in memory without touching the disk, making it harder for security software to detect.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The supply chain attack targeting NoxPlayer's update mechanism is a realistic and effective method for gaining initial access to a target system.
   - **Malicious MFC Dialog Application:**
     - The use of a malicious MFC Dialog application to decrypt and load a DLL file into memory is a sophisticated and plausible next step. This technique can help the malware maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Employing manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions is a common and effective defense evasion technique. It aligns well with the sophisticated nature of the attack described.

### Final Answer
Given the sophisticated nature of the attack sequence described, including the use of a supply chain attack, a malicious MFC Dialog application, and defense evasion techniques, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
