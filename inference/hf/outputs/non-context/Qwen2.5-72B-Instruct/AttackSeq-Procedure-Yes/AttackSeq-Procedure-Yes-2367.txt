### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the execution of commands by `netsat.exe` from an encrypted file.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Infection of removable media.
     - Collection of system files.
     - Recursive directory listings.
     - Collection of system details.
     - Cleaning up by deleting key artifacts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Infection of Removable Media:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to spread to other systems. It aligns with the initial step of the attack.
   - **Collection of System Files:**
     - After infecting removable media, the malware might collect system files to gather information or exfiltrate data.
   - **Recursive Directory Listings:**
     - This technique is often used to identify files and directories of interest, which can be useful for further data collection or to understand the system's structure.
   - **Collection of System Details:**
     - Collecting system details (e.g., OS version, installed software, network configuration) is a common step in post-infection activities to gather intelligence.
   - **Cleaning Up by Deleting Key Artifacts:**
     - Malware often attempts to cover its tracks by deleting logs, temporary files, and other artifacts to avoid detection and analysis.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common malware behavior. Each step builds upon the previous one, forming a coherent attack sequence.
   - The steps include initial infection, data collection, and cleanup, which are typical phases in a malware attack.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
