### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the T9000 malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial access through exploiting vulnerabilities CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 via an RTF file.
     - Utilizing `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll`.
     - Achieving persistence by modifying registry keys or injecting the `ResN32.dll` library into `explorer.exe`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The malware gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in an RTF file. This is a common technique used by malware to gain a foothold in a system.
   - **DLL Sideload:**
     - Using `igfxtray.exe` to sideload a malicious DLL (`hccutils.dll`) is a known technique for executing malicious code. This is often done to evade detection and run code in the context of a trusted process.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Modifying registry keys or injecting a DLL into `explorer.exe` are common methods for achieving persistence. These techniques ensure that the malware remains active even after the system is restarted.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with typical malware behavior:
     - **Initial Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in an RTF file is a common initial access vector.
     - **DLL Sideload:** Using a trusted process like `igfxtray.exe` to load a malicious DLL is a known technique for executing code and evading detection.
     - **Persistence:** Modifying registry keys or injecting a DLL into `explorer.exe` are standard methods for ensuring the malware remains active.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the commonality of these techniques in malware operations, the most plausible answer is that the T9000 malware will indeed utilize `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll` before achieving persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
