### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Grandoreiro malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Ensuring persistence by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory.
     2. Discovering system information such as the operating system version.
     3. Communicating with the C&C (Command and Control) server using the RealThinClient SDK to receive commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Creating .LNK file in the Windows startup directory):**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. It aligns with the initial step in the sequence.
   - **Discovering System Information:**
     - Malware often gathers system information to understand the environment it is operating in. This can include the operating system version, which can help the malware tailor its actions or avoid detection.
   - **Communicating with the C&C Server:**
     - After establishing persistence and gathering system information, the malware typically communicates with the C&C server to receive further commands or to exfiltrate data.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common pattern in malware operations:
     1. **Persistence:** Ensuring the malware runs at startup.
     2. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering system information to understand the environment.
     3. **C&C Communication:** Establishing a connection with the C&C server to receive commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common practices in malware operations, it is likely that Grandoreiro will discover system information before communicating with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
