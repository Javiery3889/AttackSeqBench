### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elfin group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing command and control (C2) using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.
     - Exfiltrating data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Command and Control:**
     - POSHC2 (PowerShell HTTP Command and Control) and Quasar RAT (Remote Access Tool) are both known tools used for establishing and maintaining C2 channels. This is a common first step in many cyber attacks to ensure the attacker can control the compromised system remotely.
   - **Exfiltrating Data:**
     - After gaining control, the next logical step is to exfiltrate data. The use of a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader aligns with this step.
     - FastUploader is designed for faster data transfer, which is a common requirement for exfiltrating large amounts of data efficiently.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described is highly plausible. Once the C2 is established, the attacker would likely focus on exfiltrating valuable data using tools that can transfer data quickly and efficiently.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described is logical and aligns with common attack patterns.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Elfin did proceed to exfiltrate data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
