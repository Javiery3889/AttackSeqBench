### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by The Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Gaining victim credentials using an information stealer module.
     - Targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services.
     - Deploying a keylogger module for input capture.
     - Encrypting and storing gathered data in log files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that The Darkhotel APT is likely to deploy a keylogger module after gaining victim credentials and targeting stored secrets.
     - Keyloggers are commonly used by APT groups to capture additional sensitive information, such as passwords and other credentials, that may not be stored in browsers or email services.
     - Encrypting and storing the gathered data in log files is a common practice to ensure the data is protected and can be exfiltrated securely.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that The Darkhotel APT is not likely to deploy a keylogger module after gaining victim credentials and targeting stored secrets.
     - This choice implies that the APT group would stop after gaining initial credentials and targeting stored secrets, which is less likely given the sophisticated nature of APT groups.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT is known for its sophisticated and multi-stage attack techniques.
   - After gaining initial access and credentials, it is highly likely that they would deploy additional tools, such as a keylogger, to capture more sensitive information.
   - Encrypting and storing the data in log files is a standard practice to ensure the data remains secure and can be exfiltrated without detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
