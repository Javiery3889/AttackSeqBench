### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers:
     - Steal money from ATMs by issuing commands through malicious ATM software.
     - Manipulate the ATM operating system registry.
     - Use compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts.
     - Facilitate further lateral movement by adding additional administrator accounts or using RDP Wrapper for concurrent RDP sessions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did use compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts and facilitate further lateral movement.
     - This is plausible because:
       - Compromising domain administrator passwords is a common TTP in advanced attacks.
       - Once the attackers have domain admin credentials, they can access all active domain accounts.
       - They can then add additional administrator accounts or use RDP Wrapper to facilitate concurrent RDP sessions, which are common techniques for lateral movement and maintaining persistence.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not use compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts and facilitate further lateral movement.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - If the attackers have already compromised the ATM software and the operating system registry, it is likely they would seek to escalate their privileges further.
       - Gaining domain admin access is a logical next step to maximize their control over the network and facilitate more extensive attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers did use compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts and facilitate further lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
