### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers modified a Javascript file on a CDN server to deliver malicious code to targeted websites.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation and Defense Evasion:**
     - Obfuscation is a common technique used by attackers to hide the true nature of their malicious code. This makes it harder for security tools and analysts to detect and analyze the code.
     - Dean Edwards Packer is a well-known tool for compressing and obfuscating Javascript code. It is often used to make the code smaller and less readable, which can help in evading detection.
   - **Appending to Existing File:**
     - Appending malicious code to an existing, legitimate file is a common tactic to blend in with normal traffic and avoid raising suspicion. This is often referred to as "living off the land" or "fileless" techniques.
   - **Context of the Attack:**
     - Given that the attackers are modifying a file on a CDN server, they are likely trying to maintain a low profile and avoid detection. Obfuscation and appending to an existing file are both techniques that align with this goal.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common practices in cyber attacks and the specific techniques mentioned (obfuscation and appending to an existing file), it is highly likely that the attackers would use these methods to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
