### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where a loader gathers detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) queries.
   - The loader collects information such as hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, MAC addresses, and anti-virus information.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will indeed collect a wide range of data from the victim's system.
     - Given that the loader has already gathered detailed information about the victim's system, it is plausible that the backdoor, which is often the next stage in the attack, would continue to collect more detailed and comprehensive data.
     - The backdoor is typically designed to maintain persistence and provide the attacker with extensive control over the victim's system, which often includes collecting a wide range of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not collect a wide range of data from the victim's system.
     - This is less likely because the initial information gathering by the loader is often a precursor to more extensive data collection by the backdoor.
     - If the loader has already gathered detailed information, it is reasonable to expect that the backdoor will continue this trend to provide the attacker with a comprehensive understanding of the victim's system.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The loader's initial information gathering via WMI queries indicates a sophisticated and methodical approach to the attack.
   - The backdoor, as the next stage, is likely to continue this approach by collecting a wide range of data to maintain persistence and provide the attacker with full control over the victim's system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will indeed collect a wide range of data from the victim's system.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
