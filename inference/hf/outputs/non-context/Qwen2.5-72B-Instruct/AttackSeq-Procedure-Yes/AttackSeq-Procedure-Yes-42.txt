### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the KONNI malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing communication with C2 (Command and Control) domains using HTTP connections.
     - Using a free web hosting provider for the C2 infrastructure.
     - Stealing files from the local system as part of the collection process.
     - Uploading stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the KONNI malware will indeed steal files from the local system as part of its collection process before uploading the stolen data.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of many malware families, including KONNI, which often include data exfiltration as a key component of their operations.
     - The sequence described in the question (establishing C2 communication, stealing files, and uploading data) is a common and logical sequence in malware operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the KONNI malware will not steal files from the local system as part of its collection process.
     - This is less likely, as data exfiltration is a common and essential part of many malware operations, especially those that are designed to steal sensitive information.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the logical sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible answer is that the KONNI malware will steal files from the local system as part of its collection process before uploading the stolen data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
