### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK).
     - **Reconnaissance:** Gathering victim network information.
     - **Execution:** Using JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FIN13 is known to use web shells and custom malware for initial access. This is a common TTP for many threat actors, including FIN13.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is highly likely that FIN13 would gather information about the victim's network. This is a crucial step in any attack to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Execution:**
     - Using JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying is a logical next step after reconnaissance. JSPRAT is a tool that can be used to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to gain initial access to the victim's network. This is a well-documented TTP for FIN13.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Once initial access is established, FIN13 would likely perform reconnaissance to gather information about the network. This is a standard practice in the cyber attack lifecycle to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
   - **Execution:**
     - After gathering the necessary information, FIN13 would use tools like JSPRAT to execute commands and proxy network traffic. This allows the threat actor to maintain control and further their objectives within the network.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of TTPs and the known behavior of FIN13, it is highly likely that Mandiant would track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
