### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the context of an iOS malware attack.
   - The sequence starts with the **Discovery** phase, where the malware collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will perform the following actions during the **Command and Control (C2)** phase:
     - Send the gathered information.
     - Write log messages.
     - Use a token for communication.
     - Upload files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The malware collects information, which is a common TTP in the Discovery phase. This phase is typically used to gather information about the victim's environment to plan further actions.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - **Send the gathered information:** This is a common TTP in the C2 phase. Malware often sends collected data back to the attacker's server for further analysis or to exfiltrate sensitive information.
     - **Write log messages:** Writing log messages can be part of the C2 phase, especially if the malware is designed to log its activities for the attacker to review later.
     - **Use a token for communication:** Using a token for communication is a common technique to authenticate and secure the communication between the malware and the C2 server.
     - **Upload files:** Uploading files is another common TTP in the C2 phase, where the malware might upload additional data or files to the C2 server.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that all the actions mentioned (sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files) are common and logical steps in the C2 phase, it is highly likely that the malware will perform these actions after the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
