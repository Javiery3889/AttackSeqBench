### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The attack involves delivering a malware called KerrDown to targets.
   - The delivery methods mentioned are:
     - Malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros.
     - RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros, and if it will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Malicious Microsoft Office Documents with Macros:**
     - It is common for attackers to use Office documents with embedded macros to deliver malware. These documents often contain social engineering elements to trick the victim into enabling macros.
     - An image file instructing the victim to enable macros is a typical social engineering technique to increase the likelihood of the victim enabling the macros.
   - **RAR Archives Enabling DLL Side-Loading:**
     - DLL side-loading is a technique where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL instead of the intended one. This is often used in conjunction with other delivery methods.
   - **Base64 Blobs for Payload Execution:**
     - Base64 encoding is often used to obfuscate the payload and make it harder to detect. It is a common technique to encode the payload and then decode and execute it based on the victim's system architecture.
   - **Combining the Techniques:**
     - The combination of using an Office document with macros, an image file to instruct the victim to enable macros, and base64 blobs to execute the payload is a plausible and commonly used sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common use of these techniques in cyber attacks, it is likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros and use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
