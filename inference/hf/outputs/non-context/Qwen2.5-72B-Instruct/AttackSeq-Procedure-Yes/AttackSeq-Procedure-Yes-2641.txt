### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Machete malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers using FTP and HTTP.
     - Downloading additional files for execution.
     - Exfiltration phase where data is copied to a removable drive if a specific file is present.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Machete will automatically copy data from all drives to a removable drive if a specific file is present during the exfiltration phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Machete will not automatically copy data from all drives to a removable drive if a specific file is present during the exfiltration phase.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Communication with C&C Servers:**
     - Using FTP and HTTP for C&C communication is a common technique used by malware to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Downloading Additional Files:**
     - Downloading additional files for execution is a typical behavior for malware to extend its capabilities or to perform specific tasks.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - Exfiltration is a critical phase where the malware attempts to steal and transfer data from the compromised system.
     - The question specifies that the exfiltration phase involves copying data to a removable drive if a specific file is present.
     - This is a more targeted and conditional exfiltration method, which is less common but not impossible. Malware can be designed to look for specific files or conditions before exfiltrating data to avoid detection or to ensure that only valuable data is stolen.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the described exfiltration method is more specific and conditional, it is still a plausible TTP for a sophisticated malware like Machete. Malware often includes such conditional logic to make exfiltration more targeted and less detectable.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
