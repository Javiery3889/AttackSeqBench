### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a phishing email with a malicious Excel file attachment.
   - The Excel file is said to contain a macro that displays a fake invoice while running malicious code in the background.
   - The malicious code is intended to install ISMAgent.
   - The actors associated with the OilRig campaign are mentioned as the source of the phishing emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Phishing emails with malicious attachments are a common TTP used by various threat actors, including those associated with the OilRig campaign.
     - The use of macros in Excel files to display fake content while running malicious code in the background is a well-documented technique.
     - ISMAgent is a known piece of malware associated with the OilRig campaign, often used for persistence and further malicious activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - However, the TTPs described align well with known tactics used by the OilRig campaign, making this choice less plausible.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the alignment of the described TTPs with known tactics used by the OilRig campaign, the most plausible answer is that the sequence of TTPs is likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
