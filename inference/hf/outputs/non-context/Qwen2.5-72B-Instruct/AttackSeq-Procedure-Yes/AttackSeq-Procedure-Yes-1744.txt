### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG1021.
   - Specifically, it mentions the use of a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TG1021 removed all disk-resident tools to avoid detection as part of their defense evasion strategy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation with Potato Family Tools:**
     - The Potato family of tools is known for its ability to escalate privileges by exploiting various Windows vulnerabilities. This is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to gain higher levels of access within a system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense evasion is a critical phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework where attackers attempt to avoid detection by security tools and processes.
     - Techniques under defense evasion include removing tools from the disk, using fileless malware, and other methods to minimize the footprint of their activities.
   - **TG1021's Behavior:**
     - TG1021 is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain stealth and avoid detection. This includes removing tools from the disk to reduce the chances of being discovered by security software or forensic analysis.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that TG1021 is a sophisticated threat group and has a history of using advanced techniques to avoid detection, it is highly likely that they would remove all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.
   - The use of custom tools and the focus on privilege escalation suggest a high level of operational security and a desire to remain undetected.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
