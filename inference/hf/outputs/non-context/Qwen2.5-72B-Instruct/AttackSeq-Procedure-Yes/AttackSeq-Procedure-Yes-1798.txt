### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker uses sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware will connect back to a specific domain, `pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org`, during command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sideloading Techniques:**
     - Sideloading is a technique where an attacker uses a legitimate application to load a malicious DLL. This is often used to bypass security mechanisms and establish persistence.
   - **Evasion:**
     - Evasion techniques are used to avoid detection by security software. This can include techniques like code obfuscation, process injection, and others.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - After establishing a foothold on the system, malware often needs to communicate with a C2 server to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or maintain control.
   - **Domain `pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org`:**
     - The domain name `pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org` is not a common or well-known domain. It appears to be a custom or potentially malicious domain.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attacker has already used sophisticated techniques like sideloading and evasion, it is plausible that they would also use a custom domain for C2 communication to avoid detection.
   - Malware often uses domain names that are not easily recognizable to avoid being blacklisted or detected by security systems.
   - The domain `pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org` fits the profile of a domain that could be used for C2 communication, as it is not a well-known or legitimate domain.
