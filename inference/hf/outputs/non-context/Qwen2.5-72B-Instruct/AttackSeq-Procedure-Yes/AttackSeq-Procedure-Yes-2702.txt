### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Aurora malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
     - Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.
     - Communicating with C&C (Command and Control) servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL:**
     - This is a common technique used to evade detection by making the malicious file appear as a legitimate system file. This is often referred to as "living off the land" or "file time stamping."
   - **Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process:**
     - This is another evasion technique. By loading the malicious DLL into a legitimate system process (svchost.exe), the malware can hide its presence and avoid detection by security software.
   - **Communicating with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme:**
     - Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS traffic, which is encrypted. Using this port helps the malware blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection by network security tools.
     - However, the question specifies that the communication uses a "weak custom encryption scheme." This is less common because sophisticated malware often uses strong encryption to protect its communications.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The first two TTPs (modifying file-time and loading into svchost.exe) are highly plausible and commonly used in malware.
   - The third TTP (communicating over port 443 with weak custom encryption) is less common. While using port 443 is a good evasion technique, using weak encryption is less likely because it can be easily detected and decrypted by security tools.

### Final Answer:
Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the first two steps, but the third step (using weak custom encryption) is less likely. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
