### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where CVE-2015-5119 is exploited to execute a first stage downloader.
   - This downloader retrieves a second stage payload, specifically PlugX.
   - PlugX successfully connects to several C2 domains, including cdn[.]sanecat[.]com.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Sakula malware will communicate with domains such as inocnation[.]com or oa[.]ameteksen[.]com as part of its command and control protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2015-5119:** This is a known vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that has been exploited in various campaigns to deliver malware.
   - **PlugX:** This is a sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) that is often used in targeted attacks. It is known for its ability to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Sakula:** This is a different piece of malware, typically associated with different campaigns and C2 infrastructure.
   - **C2 Domains:** The question mentions specific C2 domains (cdn[.]sanecat[.]com) that are associated with PlugX. It then asks about the likelihood of Sakula communicating with different domains (inocnation[.]com, oa[.]ameteksen[.]com).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The initial exploitation and the use of PlugX suggest a specific attack campaign that is likely using a predefined set of C2 domains.
   - Sakula is a different malware with its own C2 infrastructure and communication protocols.
   - It is unlikely that the same attack sequence that uses PlugX would also involve Sakula, as they are different malware families with different C2 domains.
   - The C2 domains mentioned (inocnation[.]com, oa[.]ameteksen[.]com) are not typically associated with PlugX and are more likely to be associated with Sakula or other malware.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
