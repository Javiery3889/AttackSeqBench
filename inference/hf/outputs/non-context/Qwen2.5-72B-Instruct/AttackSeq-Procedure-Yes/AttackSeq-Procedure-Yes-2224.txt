### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Earth Lusca used specific tools (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) to discover machines in the compromised network before engaging in lateral movement by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Phase:**
     - **Network Discovery:** Using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - **Exploiting Remote Services:** Using vulnerabilities in remote services to move laterally within the network.
     - **Internal Spear Phishing:** Using targeted phishing attacks to gain access to additional systems or credentials within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Network Discovery:**
     - Tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan are commonly used for network scanning and enumeration. These tools help attackers identify active hosts, open ports, and services running on the network, which is a crucial step before attempting lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - **Exploiting Remote Services:** Once the network is mapped, attackers can use the information gathered to exploit vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other machines.
     - **Internal Spear Phishing:** This technique involves sending targeted phishing emails to internal users to gain additional credentials or access. It is often used in conjunction with other lateral movement techniques to expand the attacker's presence in the network.

4. **Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. Network discovery is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, and it is often followed by lateral movement techniques such as exploiting remote services and internal spear phishing.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
