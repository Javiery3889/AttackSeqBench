### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by threat actors.
   - The sequence starts with phishing emails impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association' to deliver the FriarFox malicious browser extension.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actors will use this extension to contact a command and control (C2) server and retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing Emails and Initial Access:**
     - Phishing emails are a common initial access technique (T1566) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. They are often used to deliver malware or malicious links to victims.
   - **FriarFox Malicious Browser Extension:**
     - The FriarFox extension is a known malicious browser extension that can be used to gain initial access to a victim's system (T1204.002: User Execution).
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - Once the FriarFox extension is installed, it is likely to establish a connection to a C2 server (T1071: Application Layer Protocol) to receive further instructions or payloads.
   - **Retrieving the Scanbox Payload:**
     - The Scanbox payload is a known tool used for reconnaissance and data exfiltration. It is logical that after establishing a C2 connection, the threat actors would use the FriarFox extension to download and execute the Scanbox payload (T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer).

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly plausible that the threat actors will use the FriarFox extension to contact a C2 server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
