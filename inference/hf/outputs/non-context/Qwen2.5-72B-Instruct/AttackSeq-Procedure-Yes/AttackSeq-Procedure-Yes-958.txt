### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with a spear phishing email containing a malicious macro.
   - The next step is setting a persistence mechanism by creating a registry entry.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the macro code will download and store two files ("rtegre.exe" and "wprgxyeqd79.exe") in the C:\Users\Public directory before setting the persistence mechanism.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear Phishing Email with Malicious Macro:**
     - This is a common initial access technique (T1566.002 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - **Downloading and Storing Files:**
     - Downloading and storing files is a common technique for establishing a foothold and preparing for further actions (T1105 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - **Setting Persistence Mechanism:**
     - Creating a registry entry for persistence is a common technique to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts (T1547.001 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - It is highly plausible that after a user opens the spear phishing email and the macro is executed, the macro code would download additional files to the system. This is a common step in many malware campaigns to download additional payloads or tools.
     - Storing these files in a common directory like C:\Users\Public is also a common practice to avoid suspicion and ensure the files are accessible.
     - After downloading and storing the files, the next logical step would be to set up persistence to ensure the malware remains active even after the system is restarted.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - The sequence described in the question follows a logical flow of initial access, establishing a foothold, and then setting up persistence.
