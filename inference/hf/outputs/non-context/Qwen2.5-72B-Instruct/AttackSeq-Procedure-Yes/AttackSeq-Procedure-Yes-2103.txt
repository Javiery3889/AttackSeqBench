### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Defense Evasion:** Employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
     - **Discovery:** Gathering information about the victim's computer.
     - **Collection:** Collecting detailed victim system data and activity through a backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** This phase is crucial for ensuring the malware remains undetected and can operate without being analyzed or debugged.
   - **Discovery:** After evading defenses, the next logical step is to gather information about the victim's environment. This information is essential for the attacker to understand the system's configuration, network topology, and potential targets.
   - **Collection:** Once the attacker has a good understanding of the victim's system, they can then proceed to collect detailed data and activity through a backdoor.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion to Discovery:** It is highly likely that after successfully evading defenses, the attacker will move to the Discovery phase to gather information about the victim's system. This information is necessary to plan further actions and to ensure that the backdoor can be effectively deployed and used.
   - **Discovery to Collection:** The information gathered during the Discovery phase is crucial for the Collection phase. The attacker needs to know what data to collect and how to do it efficiently and stealthily.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
