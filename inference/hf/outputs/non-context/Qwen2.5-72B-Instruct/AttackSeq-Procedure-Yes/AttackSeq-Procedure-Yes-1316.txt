### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using document-based exploits to deceive victims into opening malicious PDF files.
     - Executing the malware with updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke.
     - Collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.
     - Communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is plausible.
     - CosmicDuke is known for using document-based exploits to deliver malware.
     - It has been observed to use updated loaders from MiniDuke.
     - Keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing are common data collection techniques used by advanced malware.
     - FTP and WebDav are known methods for exfiltrating data and updating the malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not plausible.
     - However, the sequence aligns well with known behaviors of CosmicDuke and similar advanced malware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible for CosmicDuke.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
