### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor GOLDBACKDOOR.
   - The sequence involves a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists to gain initial access, followed by the execution of a Windows shortcut file masquerading as a document, which then runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to deploy malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing Campaign:**
     - This is a common initial access technique used by many threat actors, including GOLDBACKDOOR. It involves sending targeted emails to specific individuals (in this case, journalists) to trick them into clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment.
   - **Windows Shortcut File (LNK File):**
     - A Windows shortcut file (LNK file) can be used to execute commands or scripts when the user double-clicks it. This is a plausible next step after gaining initial access through a spear-phishing campaign.
   - **Obfuscated PowerShell Script:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to execute a wide range of commands and actions on a Windows system. Obfuscation is often used to evade detection by security tools.
   - **Deploying Malware:**
     - The final step in the sequence is the deployment of malware, which is a common goal of many cyber attacks.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. It follows a logical progression of TTPs:
     1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing to gain access.
     2. **Execution:** Using a Windows shortcut file to execute a script.
     3. **Persistence/Command and Control:** Running an obfuscated PowerShell script to deploy malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical and common nature of the described TTPs, it is likely that GOLDBACKDOOR would follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
