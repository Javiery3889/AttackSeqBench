### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Carbanak group using the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials before compromising Domain Administrator credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Using Cobalt Strike beacon.
   - **Network Mapping:** Mapping the internal network.
   - **Credential Collection:** Collecting administrative-level credentials.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Compromising Domain Administrator credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using the Domain Administrator credentials to compromise additional endpoints.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Cobalt Strike Beacon:** Cobalt Strike is a popular penetration testing tool that can be used for various stages of an attack, including initial compromise, network mapping, and credential collection.
   - **Network Mapping:** Cobalt Strike can be used to map the internal network, which is a common step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.
   - **Credential Collection:** Cobalt Strike can be used to collect credentials, including administrative-level credentials, which is a common technique for gaining higher privileges.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Once administrative-level credentials are obtained, the next logical step is to escalate privileges to a Domain Administrator level.
   - **Lateral Movement:** With Domain Administrator credentials, the attacker can move laterally to compromise additional endpoints.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a common and logical progression of TTPs used by advanced threat actors like the Carbanak group.
   - The use of Cobalt Strike for initial compromise, network mapping, and credential collection is well-documented in various CTI reports.
   - The progression from administrative-level credentials to Domain Administrator credentials and then to lateral movement is a standard technique in advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
