### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers have established contact with C2 (Command and Control) servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server as part of their attack sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that it is likely that the attackers will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server.
     - In many advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios, attackers often seek to exfiltrate valuable credentials, including cloud service credentials like AWS, to gain further access and control over the victim's infrastructure.
     - The use of shell scripts and encoded binary files indicates a sophisticated attack, where the next logical step could be to gather and exfiltrate sensitive information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that it is not likely that the attackers will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server.
     - While this is possible, it is less likely given the context of the attack sequence described. If the attackers have already established a foothold and are using sophisticated techniques, they are likely to continue with further data exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the attack and the common practice of exfiltrating valuable credentials, it is more plausible that the attackers will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
