### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SideCopy malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gaining initial access through malicious LNK files.
     - Delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
     - Exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases.
     - Deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Malicious LNK Files:**
     - This is a common technique used by various malware to gain initial access to a system. LNK files (shortcuts) can be crafted to execute malicious code when opened.
   - **Delivering Payloads via a Convoluted Infection Chain:**
     - A convoluted infection chain suggests multiple stages of execution, often involving multiple files or processes to deliver the final payload. This is a sophisticated approach to evade detection.
   - **Exfiltrating Kavach Authentication Databases:**
     - Kavach is a specific authentication system, and exfiltrating its databases would be a targeted action. This suggests that the attackers have specific knowledge of the target environment and are after specific data.
   - **Deploying njRAT Malware for Credential Harvesting:**
     - njRAT (New Jersey RAT) is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) used for various malicious activities, including credential harvesting. Deploying njRAT after exfiltrating specific databases would be a logical next step to maintain persistence and gather more data.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - It follows a logical progression from initial access to data exfiltration and then to maintaining persistence.
     - The use of a convoluted infection chain and the specific targeting of Kavach databases indicate a sophisticated and targeted attack.
     - Deploying njRAT after exfiltrating the databases would allow the attackers to continue harvesting credentials and maintain control over the infected system.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
