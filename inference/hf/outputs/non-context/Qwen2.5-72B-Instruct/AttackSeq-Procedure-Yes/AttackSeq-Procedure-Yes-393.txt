### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a backdoor might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Discovery:** Obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time.
     2. **Collection:** Collecting files from newly inserted removable media.
     3. **Command and Control (C2) Communication:** Notifying the C2 server about the collected files.
     4. **Data Compression:** Compressing the collected files.
     5. **Exfiltration:** Sending the compressed files to the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor is likely to follow the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor is not likely to follow the described sequence of TTPs.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Discovery (T1082, T1016):** Obtaining the local IP address and system time is a common initial step in many malware operations to understand the environment and potentially avoid detection or to time actions.
   - **Collection (T1027, T1081):** Collecting files from newly inserted removable media is a plausible next step, as malware often targets removable media to gather sensitive information.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication (T1071, T1092):** Notifying the C2 server about the collected files is a logical step to ensure the C2 server is aware of the data and can instruct the malware on further actions.
   - **Data Compression (T1002):** Compressing the collected files is a common technique to reduce the size of the data being exfiltrated, making it easier to send and less likely to be detected.
   - **Exfiltration (T1041):** Sending the compressed files to the C2 server is the final step in the data exfiltration process.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and plausible sequence of TTPs that a backdoor like Vyveva's might follow. Each step in the sequence aligns with common malware behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
