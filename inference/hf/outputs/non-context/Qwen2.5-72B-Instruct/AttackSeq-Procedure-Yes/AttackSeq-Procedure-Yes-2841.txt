### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - The RTF document drops an embedded downloader file.
   - The MSIL/Crimson malware is expected to execute on the victim's machine.
   - The malware is expected to download a full RAT component from a specific IP address and port.
   - The malware is expected to establish command and control (C2) using a custom TCP protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - CVE-2012-0158 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This is a plausible method for initial access.
   - **Dropping an Embedded Downloader:**
     - Once the vulnerability is exploited, it is common for malware to drop a downloader or loader to fetch additional components.
   - **Execution of MSIL/Crimson Malware:**
     - MSIL/Crimson is a known malware that can be delivered via a downloader. It is designed to perform various malicious activities.
   - **Downloading the Full RAT Component:**
     - Malware often downloads additional components, such as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), to gain more control over the victim's machine.
   - **Establishing Command and Control:**
     - After downloading the RAT, the malware would typically establish a C2 channel to receive commands from the attacker. Using a custom TCP protocol is a plausible method for this.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access method (CVE-2012-0158) is a known and effective way to gain entry into a system.
   - Dropping an embedded downloader is a common next step in the attack chain.
   - The execution of MSIL/Crimson malware is consistent with the behavior of such malware.
   - Downloading a full RAT component from a specified IP and port is a logical step to gain more control.
   - Establishing C2 using a custom TCP protocol is a common technique used by malware to maintain communication with the attacker.
