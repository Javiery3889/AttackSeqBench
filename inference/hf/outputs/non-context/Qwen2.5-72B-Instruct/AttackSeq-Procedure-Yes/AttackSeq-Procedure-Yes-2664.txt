### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the OceanLotus backdoor executing a hidden file named `.CFUserEncoding` and displaying a decoy document after being delivered via an email attachment as part of a phishing campaign.
   - Key elements to consider:
     - **OceanLotus Backdoor:** A known piece of malware used by the OceanLotus (APT32) group.
     - **Hidden File Execution:** The file `.CFUserEncoding` is mentioned.
     - **Decoy Document:** A document used to distract the victim.
     - **Phishing Campaign:** The method of delivery is via an email attachment.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **OceanLotus Backdoor:**
     - OceanLotus (APT32) is known for sophisticated and targeted attacks, often involving the use of backdoors to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.
     - They have been known to use various techniques to evade detection and maintain stealth.
   - **Hidden File Execution:**
     - The use of hidden files is a common technique in malware to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
     - The file name `.CFUserEncoding` is not a standard or commonly used file name, which could be a red flag for malware.
   - **Decoy Document:**
     - Displaying a decoy document is a common tactic in phishing campaigns to make the victim believe that the attachment is legitimate and to keep them engaged.
   - **Phishing Campaign:**
     - Phishing campaigns often involve sending malicious attachments via email, which, when opened, can execute malware.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - Given the known tactics of the OceanLotus group, it is plausible that they would use a hidden file and a decoy document in a phishing campaign to deliver and execute their backdoor.
   - The combination of these elements aligns with the typical attack patterns of sophisticated APT groups like OceanLotus.
