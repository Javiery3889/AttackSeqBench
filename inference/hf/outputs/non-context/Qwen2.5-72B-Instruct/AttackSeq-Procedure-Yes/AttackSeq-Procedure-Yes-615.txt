### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Obfuscation within a VBS script** for defense evasion.
     - **Self-deletion post-execution** of the VBS script.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the VBS script will communicate with a C&C server at a specific URL.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation within a VBS script:** This is a common technique used to evade detection by security software. Obfuscation makes the script harder to read and analyze, which can help it bypass signature-based detection.
   - **Self-deletion post-execution:** This is another technique used to avoid leaving traces on the system, which can help evade forensic analysis and detection by security software.
   - **Communication with a C&C server:** This is a typical behavior for malware, especially after initial infection and execution. The C&C server is used to receive commands, exfiltrate data, or download additional payloads.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Obfuscation and Self-Deletion:** These techniques are often used in conjunction with other malicious activities, such as communication with a C&C server. The purpose of obfuscation and self-deletion is to ensure that the malware can operate undetected and leave minimal traces.
   - **C&C Communication:** Given that the VBS script is already employing techniques to evade detection and avoid leaving traces, it is highly likely that the script would also communicate with a C&C server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. The URL provided in the question is a typical format for a C&C server communication, where the script might send the computer name and a unique identifier (hexadecimal volume serial number) to the server.
