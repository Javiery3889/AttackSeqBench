### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the StellarParticle campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gaining initial access through SSH using stolen local accounts.
     - Establishing RDP sessions via port forwarding.
     - Using credential hopping and Delegated Administrator rights for persistence.
     - Evading defenses by stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The campaign gains initial access through SSH using stolen local accounts. This is a common technique for gaining initial access.
   - **Establishing RDP Sessions:**
     - After gaining initial access, the campaign establishes RDP sessions via port forwarding. This is a logical next step to maintain access and control over the compromised system.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The campaign uses credential hopping and Delegated Administrator rights for persistence. Credential hopping involves moving from one set of credentials to another to maintain access, and Delegated Administrator rights can provide elevated privileges, which are both effective techniques for persistence.
   - **Evasion:**
     - The campaign evades defenses by stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication. Stealing browser cookies can indeed be used to bypass multifactor authentication, which is a sophisticated evasion technique.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question follows a logical and plausible attack path:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gaining access through SSH using stolen local accounts.
     2. **Establishing RDP Sessions:** Using port forwarding to establish RDP sessions for remote control.
     3. **Persistence:** Using credential hopping and Delegated Administrator rights to maintain long-term access.
     4. **Evasion:** Stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication and avoid detection.

   - Each step in the sequence is a well-known and effective technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
     - **Initial Access:** T1021 (Remote Services) and T1078 (Valid Accounts)
     - **Establishing RDP Sessions:** T1021.1 (Remote Desktop Protocol)
     - **Persistence:** T1098 (Account Manipulation) and T1134 (Access Token Manipulation)
     - **Evasion:** T1555 (Credential Access) and T1550 (Use Alternate Authentication Material)
