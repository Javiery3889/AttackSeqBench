### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - The malicious Word document contains a VBS macro.
   - The VBS macro retrieves an encoded PowerShell script.
   - The PowerShell script is expected to execute and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing:**
     - Phishing emails with malicious Word documents are a common initial access vector. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK T1566 (Phishing) technique.
   - **VBS Macro in Word Document:**
     - VBS macros in Word documents are often used to execute malicious code. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK T1204.002 (User Execution: Malicious File) and T1059.001 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell) techniques.
   - **Encoded PowerShell Script:**
     - Encoded PowerShell scripts are frequently used to obfuscate malicious commands and evade detection. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) technique.
   - **Downloading Payloads:**
     - PowerShell scripts can be used to download additional payloads. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) technique.
   - **Ursnif and GandCrab Malware:**
     - Ursnif is a banking trojan, and GandCrab is a ransomware. Both are known to be delivered via malicious scripts and downloads.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common attack pattern. Each step in the sequence aligns with known TTPs and the capabilities of the mentioned malware.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
