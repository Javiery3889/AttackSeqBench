### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the INOCNATION malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - XOR obfuscation
     - Sandbox detection
     - String stacking obfuscation
   - The question asks whether INOCNATION is likely to use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for command and control (C2) communications.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **XOR Obfuscation:** This technique is used to obfuscate data, making it harder for security tools to detect the malware's payload or commands.
   - **Sandbox Detection:** This technique is used to detect if the malware is running in a sandbox environment, which is often used by security researchers to analyze malware behavior.
   - **String Stacking Obfuscation:** This technique involves breaking strings into smaller pieces and reassembling them at runtime to evade detection.
   - **Encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS:** Using encrypted HTTPS for C2 communications is a common technique to hide the communication content from network monitoring tools.
   - **Windows' Standard SSL/TLS Libraries:** Using standard libraries ensures that the malware can easily integrate with the operating system and avoid suspicion.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of XOR obfuscation, sandbox detection, and string stacking obfuscation indicates that INOCNATION is designed to evade detection and analysis.
   - Encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS is a logical next step in the attack sequence because it provides an additional layer of security and helps to hide the C2 communications from network monitoring tools.
   - Using Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries is also a common practice for malware to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid raising suspicion.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sophisticated defense evasion techniques already employed by INOCNATION, it is highly likely that the malware would also use encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries for C2 communications.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
