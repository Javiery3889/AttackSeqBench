### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Sednit group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Collection Phase:** Scanning and staging files for exfiltration.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:** Encrypting network traffic for secure communication with the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Sednit group is likely to encrypt network traffic with AES or a custom algorithm during the C2 phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Sednit group is not likely to encrypt network traffic with AES or a custom algorithm during the C2 phase.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Sednit Group (also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, etc.)** is a sophisticated threat actor known for using advanced techniques to maintain stealth and evade detection.
   - **Encryption of Network Traffic:**
     - Encrypting network traffic is a common practice in the C2 phase to protect the communication from being intercepted and analyzed by security tools.
     - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used and trusted encryption algorithm.
     - Custom algorithms are also used by advanced threat actors to avoid detection by signature-based security solutions.
   - **Historical TTPs:**
     - The Sednit group has been known to use various encryption methods, including AES and custom algorithms, to secure their C2 communications.
     - This aligns with their goal of maintaining a low profile and avoiding detection.

### Final Answer:
Given the sophisticated nature of the Sednit group and their known use of encryption for secure C2 communications, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
