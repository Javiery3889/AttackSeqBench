### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG1021.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
     - Loading these tools directly into memory.
     - Gathering output files during the Discovery phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TG1021 would:
     - Access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
     - Drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - SharpHound is a tool used for mapping network topology and identifying potential targets.
     - PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts for various tasks, including reconnaissance.
     - Both tools are commonly used in the Discovery phase to gather information about the network and identify potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement Phase:**
     - Accessing shared folders over SMB is a common technique for lateral movement.
     - Dropping a web shell (like NodeIISWeb) is a method to maintain persistence and gain remote access to compromised servers.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - After performing reconnaissance and gathering information, it is logical for an attacker to use the gathered information to move laterally within the network.
     - Accessing shared folders over SMB and dropping a web shell aligns with the typical progression of an attack, where the attacker uses the discovered information to gain access to additional systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression from the Discovery phase to the Lateral Movement phase, and the common use of SMB and web shells in such scenarios, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
