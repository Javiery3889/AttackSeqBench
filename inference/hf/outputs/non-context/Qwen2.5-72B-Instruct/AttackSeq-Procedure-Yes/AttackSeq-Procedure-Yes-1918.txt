### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10, including:
     - Using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2).
     - Transferring data using tools like Robocopy and Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP).
   - The question then asks if APT10 is likely to push data from victim networks to other networks they have access to and then pull the data to their own C2 servers for exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - APT10 is known for using sophisticated and multi-stage exfiltration techniques to avoid detection and ensure data is securely transferred.
     - Using dynamic-DNS domains for C2 and tools like Robocopy and PSCP indicates a methodical approach to data transfer.
     - Pushing data to other networks they have access to and then pulling it to their C2 servers is a common tactic to obfuscate the exfiltration process and make it harder to trace the data back to the attackers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that APT10 would not use such a multi-stage exfiltration method.
     - However, given the sophistication of APT10 and their known use of advanced TTPs, this answer is less likely to be correct.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known TTPs of APT10 and the sophistication of their operations, it is highly likely that they would use a multi-stage exfiltration method to ensure data is securely and stealthily transferred.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
