### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where WinDealer malware is delivered using a legitimate application's automatic update mechanism.
   - The malware maintains persistence through the registry's RUN key for configuration updates.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that WinDealer will use UDP port 6999 and TCP port 55556 for Command and Control (C2) communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Persistence:**
     - The use of a legitimate application's automatic update mechanism for initial access is a common technique (T1112: Modify Registry) to gain a foothold in the system.
     - Maintaining persistence through the registry's RUN key (T1060: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription) is also a well-known method to ensure the malware runs at system startup or when certain events occur.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - C2 communication is a critical phase in the attack lifecycle where the malware communicates with the attacker's server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - The choice of specific ports (UDP 6999 and TCP 55556) for C2 communication is less common and can be considered unusual. Typically, attackers use well-known ports or ports that are less likely to be blocked by firewalls (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS ports 80 and 443).
     - However, using less common ports can sometimes be a tactic to avoid detection by network monitoring tools that are configured to monitor standard ports.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the use of specific ports like UDP 6999 and TCP 55556 is not impossible, it is less likely compared to using more common ports.
   - The question does not provide additional context that would strongly suggest the use of these specific ports.

### Final Answer:
B: No
