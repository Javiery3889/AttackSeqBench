### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Ensuring the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) payload remains in memory without touching the disk for defense evasion.
     - Injecting the NanoCore RAT payload into a new process.
     - Connecting the RAT back to its control server associated with the domain `chickenkiller.com` owned by a free dynamic DNS service during command and control.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Keeping the payload in memory without touching the disk is a common technique to evade detection by antivirus and other security software. This is known as "fileless" or "memory-only" malware.
   - **Process Injection:**
     - Injecting the RAT payload into a new process is another common technique to hide the malicious activity and make it harder to detect. This can be done using techniques like process hollowing, reflective DLL injection, or other methods.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Connecting the RAT back to a control server is a crucial step for the attackers to maintain control over the compromised system. Using a domain associated with a free dynamic DNS service is a common tactic to avoid detection and to easily change the IP address if the current one is blacklisted.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. Attackers often use a combination of memory-based execution, process injection, and dynamic DNS services to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system while evading detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
