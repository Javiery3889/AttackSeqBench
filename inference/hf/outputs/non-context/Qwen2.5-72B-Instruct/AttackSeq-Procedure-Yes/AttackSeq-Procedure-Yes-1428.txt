### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the BLUELIGHT malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Disguising exploit code within legitimate scripts on a compromised website (Daily NK).
     - Using the Microsoft Graph API for command and control (C2) operations.
     - Performing OAuth2 token authentication.
     - Setting up a directory structure in OneDrive.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Disguising Exploit Code:**
     - This is a common technique used to evade detection by security systems. It aligns with the T1027 (Obfuscation) and T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Using Microsoft Graph API for C2:**
     - The Microsoft Graph API is a powerful tool that can be used for various purposes, including C2 operations. This aligns with the T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocols) and T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) techniques.
   - **OAuth2 Token Authentication:**
     - OAuth2 is a protocol for authorization and is commonly used to access APIs. This aligns with the T1136 (Create Account) and T1110 (Brute Force) techniques.
   - **Setting Up a Directory Structure in OneDrive:**
     - OneDrive is a cloud storage service that can be used to store and exfiltrate data. Setting up a directory structure aligns with the T1107 (File Deletion) and T1123 (Data from Information Repositories) techniques.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. It follows a logical progression:
     - **Initial Compromise:** Disguising exploit code within legitimate scripts to gain initial access.
     - **C2 Establishment:** Using the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations, which is a sophisticated and stealthy method.
     - **Authentication:** Performing OAuth2 token authentication to maintain access and avoid detection.
     - **Data Storage:** Setting up a directory structure in OneDrive to store and manage data, which can be used for exfiltration or further operations.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
