### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where The Inception Framework used weaponized RTF documents distributed via spear phishing emails to exploit vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158) for initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers leveraged a cloud service for their command-and-control (C2) infrastructure using the WebDAV protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of weaponized RTF documents and spear phishing emails to exploit specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158) is a common technique for gaining initial access. This aligns with the TTPs described in the question.
   - **Command-and-Control (C2) Infrastructure:**
     - Cloud services are often used for C2 infrastructure due to their reliability, scalability, and the ability to blend in with normal traffic.
     - WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a protocol that allows users to manage files on a remote server. It is less commonly used for C2 compared to more common protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS.
     - However, WebDAV can be used for C2 if the attackers want to leverage a less common protocol to avoid detection by standard network monitoring tools.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While cloud services are a plausible choice for C2 infrastructure, the specific use of WebDAV is less common and might be considered a more advanced or niche technique.
   - Given the sophistication of The Inception Framework and the use of specific vulnerabilities, it is not entirely implausible that they might use WebDAV for C2, but it is less likely compared to more common protocols.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
