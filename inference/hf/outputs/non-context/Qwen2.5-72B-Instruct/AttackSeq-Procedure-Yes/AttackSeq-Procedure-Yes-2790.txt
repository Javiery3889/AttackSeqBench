### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. The app hides its icon and runs in the background.
     2. The app collects a list of processes for discovery.
     3. The app sends the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the app will indeed collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the gathered information to the C2 server.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of malware, which often collects system information to understand the environment and to exfiltrate data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the app will not collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the gathered information to the C2 server.
     - This is less likely because collecting system information, such as a list of processes, is a common step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1: Initial Execution and Concealment**
     - The app hides its icon and runs in the background, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by the user.
   - **Step 2: Data Collection**
     - Collecting a list of processes is a typical reconnaissance activity. This helps the attacker understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Step 3: Data Exfiltration**
     - Sending the gathered information, including the processes data, to the C2 server is a common next step to exfiltrate the collected data for further analysis or to prepare for subsequent attacks.

Given the typical behavior of malware and the logical sequence of actions described, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
