### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware Korplug.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Decryption of Encrypted Configuration Data:** Korplug decrypts its configuration data.
     - **Discovery Phase:** Korplug retrieves system details such as locale, hostname, and IP addresses.
     - **Collection Phase:** The question asks if it is likely that Korplug will collect data from removable media during this phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The discovery phase is typically used by malware to gather information about the environment it is running in. This includes system details like locale, hostname, and IP addresses, which can help the malware determine how to proceed with its attack.
   - **Collection Phase:** The collection phase involves gathering data that the malware can exfiltrate or use for further actions. This can include a wide range of data types, such as files, credentials, and other sensitive information.
   - **Removable Media:** Removable media (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives) are often a target for data collection because they can contain valuable data that is not stored on the primary system.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Korplug has already performed the discovery phase to gather system details, it is likely that it will continue to collect data from various sources during the collection phase.
   - Removable media is a common target for data collection because it can contain additional sensitive information that is not present on the primary system.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Korplug would collect data from removable media during the collection phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
