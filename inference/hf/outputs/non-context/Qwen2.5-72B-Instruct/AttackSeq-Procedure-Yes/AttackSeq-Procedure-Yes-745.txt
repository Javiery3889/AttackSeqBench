### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Tortoiseshell gains initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a malicious website (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com).
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware downloader will execute binaries before the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) named 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through social engineering, where users are tricked into downloading a fake app.
   - **Malware Downloader:**
     - Once the fake app is downloaded, it is likely that the app itself is a malware downloader. The purpose of a malware downloader is to download and execute additional malicious payloads.
   - **Execution of Binaries:**
     - The malware downloader will typically execute binaries (other malicious files) to carry out further stages of the attack.
   - **RAT Installation:**
     - One of the binaries executed by the malware downloader could be the RAT named 'IvizTech'.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The RAT 'IvizTech' is then installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence, ensuring that the attacker has continued access to the compromised system.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker tricks users into downloading a fake app.
     2. **Malware Downloader:** The fake app acts as a malware downloader.
     3. **Execution of Binaries:** The malware downloader executes additional binaries.
     4. **RAT Installation:** One of the binaries is the RAT 'IvizTech'.
     5. **Persistence:** The RAT is installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence.

   - Given this sequence, it is logical that the malware downloader would execute binaries (including the RAT) before the RAT is installed and executed as a service.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
