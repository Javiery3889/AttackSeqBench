### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Tropic Trooper threat group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Initial access via exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
     2. Downloading and installing an MSI package.
     3. Dropping a backdoor installer.
     4. Preparing for execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool by UserInstall.exe.
     5. Achieving persistence by loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor is a known technique used by Tropic Trooper to gain initial access. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).
   - **Downloading and Installing an MSI Package:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to download and install additional payloads, such as an MSI package. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1129 (Component Object Model Hijacking) or T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer).
   - **Dropping a Backdoor Installer:**
     - Once the MSI package is installed, it is plausible that the system will drop a backdoor installer. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) and T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution).
   - **Preparing for Execution of BITSadmin:**
     - BITSadmin is a command-line tool used to create and manage Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) jobs. It is often used by attackers to download additional files or execute commands. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1197 (BITS Jobs).
   - **Achieving Persistence:**
     - Loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers is a common method for achieving persistence. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) and T1078 (Valid Accounts).

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and plausible attack flow:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to gain initial access.
     2. **Download and Install:** Downloading and installing an MSI package to deploy additional malware.
     3. **Backdoor Installer:** Dropping a backdoor installer to maintain access.
     4. **BITSadmin Preparation:** Preparing for the execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool to download or execute additional components.
     5. **Persistence:** Achieving persistence by loading an encrypted configuration file to maintain communication with the C&C servers.
