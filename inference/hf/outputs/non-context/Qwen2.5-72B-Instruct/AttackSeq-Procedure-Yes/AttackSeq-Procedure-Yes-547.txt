### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers:
     - Renting servers from hosting providers (e.g., ServerAstra).
     - Acquiring domain names through registrars (e.g., Njalla).
     - Compromising high-profile websites to inject JavaScript code.
     - Exploiting visitors’ browsers through fingerprinting as part of their initial access strategy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of actions is likely.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       - **Renting servers and acquiring domain names:** These are common initial steps in setting up infrastructure for a cyber attack. They provide the necessary resources to host malicious content and manage the attack.
       - **Compromising high-profile websites:** This is a plausible next step. High-profile websites have a large user base, making them attractive targets for initial access.
       - **Injecting JavaScript code:** Once a high-profile website is compromised, injecting JavaScript code is a common technique to deliver malicious content to visitors.
       - **Exploiting visitors’ browsers through fingerprinting:** Fingerprinting is a technique used to gather information about a visitor's browser and device, which can be used to tailor attacks or avoid detection. This is a logical step in the initial access strategy to identify vulnerable targets.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of actions is not likely.
     - However, the sequence described is a well-known and effective method for gaining initial access and setting up a cyber attack. Each step logically follows the previous one and aligns with common TTPs observed in cyber threat intelligence reports.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of actions described in the question is a plausible and logical sequence of TTPs for an initial access strategy.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
