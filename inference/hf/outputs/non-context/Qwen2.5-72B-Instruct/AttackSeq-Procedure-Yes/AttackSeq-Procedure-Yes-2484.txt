### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with spear-phishing emails containing Russian-language exploit-laden Microsoft Word documents or RAR archives.
   - These RAR archives are said to contain the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the RAR SFX (Self-Extracting) executables will drop the PlugX malware before the malware establishes persistence through service and run key installation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a common initial access vector. When a user opens the malicious document or RAR archive, the exploit is triggered, leading to the execution of the malware.
   - **Malware Delivery:**
     - RAR SFX executables are often used to deliver malware. When the user opens the RAR SFX file, it extracts and runs the malicious payload (in this case, PlugX).
   - **Persistence:**
     - Once the malware is executed, it typically attempts to establish persistence to ensure it can survive system reboots and remain active on the victim's system.
     - Common persistence techniques include creating services and modifying the Windows Registry (e.g., Run keys).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with typical malware behavior:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker uses spear-phishing emails to trick the user into opening a malicious document or RAR archive.
     2. **Malware Delivery:** The RAR SFX executable drops the PlugX malware onto the system.
     3. **Persistence:** The PlugX malware then establishes persistence by creating services and modifying the Windows Registry.

   - It is highly likely that the RAR SFX executables will drop the PlugX malware before the malware attempts to establish persistence. This is because the malware needs to be present on the system before it can perform any actions to maintain persistence.
