### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus group gained initial access to a victim's network through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document and achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory before conducting discovery activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - **Execution:** Running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.
   - **Discovery:** System network connections discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (Spear-Phishing):** Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique used by many threat actors, including Lazarus. It involves sending targeted emails with malicious attachments or links to gain a foothold in the victim's network.
   - **Execution (ThreatNeedle Backdoor):** Once the malicious Word document is opened, it can execute a payload, such as the ThreatNeedle backdoor, which can run in memory to maintain persistence and control.
   - **Discovery (System Network Connections):** After gaining initial access and executing the backdoor, the next logical step for an attacker is to conduct discovery activities to understand the network environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

4. **Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. It follows a typical attack pattern where initial access is gained through social engineering (spear-phishing), followed by execution of a backdoor, and then discovery activities to map the network.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
