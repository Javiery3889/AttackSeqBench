### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access gained through spear phishing emails.
   - The emails contain an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - The exploit is delivered via a malicious Word document named "Agreement.docx."
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files after being executed.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear phishing emails are a common method for initial access. The use of an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) is a known technique to gain initial access.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - The exploit is delivered via a malicious Word document, which is a common vector for client-side exploitation.
   - **Bankshot Implant:**
     - Bankshot is a known implant used by threat actors. It is designed to maintain persistence and communicate with command and control (C2) servers.
   - **Communication Disguised as ZIP Files:**
     - Threat actors often use various techniques to disguise their C2 communications to avoid detection. Disguising communications as common file types like ZIP files is a plausible method to evade detection.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is reasonable to assume that after the initial access and exploitation, the Bankshot implant would be deployed.
   - The Bankshot implant is known to communicate with C2 servers, and using a common file type like a ZIP file to disguise these communications is a plausible and effective technique.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
