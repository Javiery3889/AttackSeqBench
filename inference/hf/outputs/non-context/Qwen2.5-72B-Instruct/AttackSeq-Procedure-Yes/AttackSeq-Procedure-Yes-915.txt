### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of a vulnerability in PHPUnit (CVE-2017-9841) to gain initial access.
   - The attacker injects arbitrary PHP code on the server.
   - The question then asks if the Tuyul botnet is likely to execute commands using Perl scripts before maintaining persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 to inject arbitrary PHP code is a known method for gaining initial access. This aligns with the initial steps of the attack.
   - **Execution of Commands:**
     - The question asks if the Tuyul botnet is likely to execute commands using Perl scripts. Tuyul botnets are typically associated with executing commands in various scripting languages, but Perl is not the most common choice for such botnets. They are more likely to use shell scripts (bash, sh) or other common scripting languages.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question mentions maintaining persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'. This is a common method for maintaining persistence in botnets. The use of a cron job to periodically download and execute a script is a well-known technique.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - While the initial access and persistence methods described are plausible, the use of Perl scripts for command execution is less likely for the Tuyul botnet. Tuyul botnets are more commonly associated with using shell scripts (bash, sh) for their operations.
   - The sequence described in the question is not entirely consistent with the typical behavior of the Tuyul botnet.
