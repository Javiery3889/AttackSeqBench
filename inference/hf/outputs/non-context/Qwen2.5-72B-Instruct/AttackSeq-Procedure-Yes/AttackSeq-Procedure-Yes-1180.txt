### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker has employed a backdoor function to collect machine information and take screenshots.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C (Command and Control) server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor function is used to collect machine information.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor function is used to take screenshots.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicates with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - It is common for backdoors to use encrypted channels to communicate with C&C servers. This is because encryption helps to hide the communication from network monitoring tools and security systems, making it more difficult for defenders to detect and analyze the traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - While it is possible for backdoors to communicate without encryption, it is less common and more risky for the attacker. Unencrypted communication can be easily intercepted and analyzed, potentially leading to the discovery and disruption of the attack.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the importance of stealth and avoiding detection, it is highly likely that the backdoor will use an encrypted channel to communicate with the C&C server. This aligns with best practices in modern malware and APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) operations.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
