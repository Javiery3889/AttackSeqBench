### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the PIVY variant.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **DLL Sideloading:** A technique where the malware loads a legitimate application and injects a malicious DLL to execute its code.
     - **Configuration Modification:** The malware modifies its configuration to confuse tools that parse configuration data.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Sideloading:** This technique is often used to evade detection by security tools. By loading a legitimate application and injecting a malicious DLL, the malware can operate under the guise of a trusted process.
   - **Configuration Modification:** Modifying the configuration can help the malware avoid detection by signature-based tools and make it harder to analyze.
   - **C2 Communication:** After evading detection and establishing itself on the system, it is common for malware to communicate with C2 servers to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or maintain persistence.
   - **Application Layer Protocols:** C2 communication often uses application layer protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, or FTP to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware has successfully evaded defenses and modified its configuration, it is highly likely that the next step in its attack sequence would be to establish communication with C2 servers.
   - Using application layer protocols is a common and effective method for C2 communication, as it allows the malware to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection by network security tools.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
