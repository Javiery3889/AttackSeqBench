### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Compromising trusted commercial network resources.
     - Using small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code.
     - Employing techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources:**
     - This is a common initial step in many APT campaigns to establish a foothold and leverage trusted infrastructure.
   - **Using Small Downloaders and Zero-Day Exploits:**
     - Small downloaders are often used to download additional malware or tools.
     - Zero-day exploits are highly valuable and are used to gain initial access or escalate privileges.
   - **Signing Backdoors with Digital Certificates:**
     - This is a technique used for defense evasion, making the malware appear more legitimate and harder to detect.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with known APT attack patterns:
     1. **Initial Compromise:** Compromising trusted commercial network resources.
     2. **Execution of Malicious Code:** Using small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** Signing backdoors with digital certificates to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and alignment with known APT tactics, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
