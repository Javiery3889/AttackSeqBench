### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Smooth Operator malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers over HTTPS.
     - Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via a second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers over HTTPS:**
     - This is a common TTP for malware to maintain stealth and avoid detection by using a secure and widely used protocol.
   - **Using a Custom Data Encoding Algorithm for Obfuscation:**
     - This is another common TTP to make the data being exfiltrated less detectable by network monitoring tools.
   - **Exfiltration via HTTP GET Request:**
     - While HTTP GET requests are common for data exfiltration, they are less stealthy compared to HTTPS. Malware often uses HTTPS for exfiltration to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Second-Stage Payload:**
     - A second-stage payload is typically used to perform more sophisticated actions, such as data exfiltration, after the initial infection and communication with the C2 server are established.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware has already established communication over HTTPS and is using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, it is less likely that it would switch to a less stealthy method like HTTP GET for exfiltration.
   - The use of HTTPS and custom encoding suggests a focus on maintaining stealth and avoiding detection.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that the second-stage payload would continue to use HTTPS for exfiltration to maintain the same level of stealth.

### Final Answer: B: No
