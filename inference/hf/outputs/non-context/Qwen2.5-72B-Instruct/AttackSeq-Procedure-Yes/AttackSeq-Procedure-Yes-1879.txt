### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation.
     - Potentially employing network sniffing to obtain credentials.
     - Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation:**
     - This is a common technique used to gain access to sensitive information and escalate privileges. It aligns with the initial stages of an attack where the threat actor is trying to gain deeper access to the system.
   - **Employing network sniffing to obtain credentials:**
     - Network sniffing is a technique used to capture network traffic and extract sensitive information, such as credentials. This is often used after gaining initial access to the network to gather more credentials and move laterally.
   - **Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance:**
     - This is a typical next step after gaining access and credentials. The threat actor uses these tools to understand the network topology and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access and Privilege Escalation:** Using trojanized KeePass binaries to log passwords and escalate privileges.
     2. **Credential Access:** Employing network sniffing to capture additional credentials.
     3. **Reconnaissance:** Using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs and the common attack pattern, it is plausible that FIN13 would employ network sniffing to obtain credentials before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
