### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial reconnaissance phase where the Rising Sun implant gathers various system information such as network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address, and OS product name from the registry.
   - The question then asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - The initial reconnaissance phase is a common first step in many cyber attacks. It involves gathering information about the target system to understand its environment and capabilities.
     - The information gathered (network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address, and OS product name) is typical for an attacker to collect to plan further actions.
   - **Communication with Control Servers:**
     - After reconnaissance, the next logical step for an implant like Rising Sun is to establish a command and control (C2) channel with the attacker's servers.
     - HTTP POST requests are a common method for C2 communication because they can blend in with normal web traffic and are less likely to be detected by network security systems.
   - **Specific URLs:**
     - The URLs mentioned (34.214.99.20/view_style.php and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php) are likely to be used as C2 servers. These URLs are not typical web pages and are more likely to be used for malicious purposes.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described, it is highly plausible that the Rising Sun implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests after performing initial reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
