### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.
     - Leveraging native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts.
     - Using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gaining Credentials via Memory Dumping LSASS and Network Sniffing:**
     - Memory dumping LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is a common technique used to extract credentials from memory.
     - Network sniffing can also be used to capture credentials in transit.
     - Both techniques are consistent with the initial stages of an attack where the goal is to obtain valid credentials.

   - **Leveraging Native OS Binaries and Scripts for Gathering Information:**
     - Once credentials are obtained, threat actors often use native OS binaries and scripts to gather information about the network and user accounts.
     - This is part of the internal reconnaissance phase, where the attacker aims to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
     - Common tools and techniques include using `net` commands, `whoami`, `ipconfig`, and PowerShell scripts to gather information.

   - **Using WMI for Lateral Movement:**
     - WMI is a powerful tool for managing and querying system information and can be used for lateral movement.
     - Threat actors can use WMI to execute commands on remote systems, which is a common technique for moving laterally within a network.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common progression of TTPs used by advanced threat actors like FIN13.
   - Gaining credentials, performing internal reconnaissance, and then using WMI for lateral movement are all well-documented techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
