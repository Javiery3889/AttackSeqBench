### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery:** Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
     - **Use of Geographically Distributed Bots:** Utilizing bots spread across different geographic locations to perform the scanning and identification.
   - The question then asks if APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like `pr.dll` to upload stolen data to the C&C (Command and Control) server as part of data collection efforts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, is known for its sophisticated and multi-stage attack techniques.
     - After discovering and compromising vulnerable systems, it is common for advanced threat actors like APT28 to deploy additional modules to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, and communicate with C&C servers.
     - The use of `pr.dll` or similar modules to upload stolen data is a typical data exfiltration technique used by APT groups.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 would not deploy additional modules for data exfiltration.
     - Given the sophistication and known tactics of APT28, this is less likely. APT28 is known for its comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to maintaining access and exfiltrating data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known TTPs of APT28 and the typical sequence of actions in a multi-stage attack, it is highly likely that APT28 would deploy additional modules like `pr.dll` to upload stolen data to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
