### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the activities of the Desert Falcons, a known threat actor.
   - It mentions that they used homemade backdoors for Command and Control (C2) activities, including keylogging and password stealing.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that they conducted spear phishing emails and social engineering techniques to achieve Initial Access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear Phishing and Social Engineering:**
     - Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers send emails that appear to be from a trusted source to specific individuals or organizations. The goal is to trick the recipient into clicking a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment, which can lead to the installation of malware.
     - Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers gain a foothold in the target network. Common techniques include spear phishing, drive-by compromises, and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Desert Falcons' TTPs:**
     - The question mentions that Desert Falcons used homemade backdoors for C2 activities, which suggests they needed a way to initially compromise the target systems.
     - Given that they are targeting high-profile victims, it is highly likely that they would use sophisticated and targeted methods like spear phishing and social engineering to gain initial access.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that Desert Falcons conducted spear phishing emails and social engineering techniques to achieve Initial Access. These methods are common and effective for targeting high-profile victims and gaining the initial foothold needed to deploy backdoors and conduct C2 activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
