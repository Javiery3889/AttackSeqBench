### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) via email attachments.
   - The Taidoor malware is dropped and a decoy document is opened for initial access.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers using a modified traffic pattern.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Taidoor is known to be a sophisticated malware that has been used in targeted attacks.
     - Sophisticated malware often includes mechanisms to avoid detection, such as evolving to avoid common network detection signatures.
     - Modifying traffic patterns to evade detection is a common technique used by advanced malware to maintain persistence and avoid being detected by network security tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Taidoor will not evolve to avoid detection or modify its traffic pattern.
     - Given the sophistication of Taidoor and the common practices of advanced malware, this choice seems less likely.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Taidoor is known for its ability to adapt and evolve to avoid detection.
   - The use of a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) and the dropping of a decoy document indicate a well-planned attack.
   - Advanced malware often includes features to avoid common network detection signatures and to modify traffic patterns to evade detection.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid detection and modify its traffic pattern before communicating with its CnC servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
