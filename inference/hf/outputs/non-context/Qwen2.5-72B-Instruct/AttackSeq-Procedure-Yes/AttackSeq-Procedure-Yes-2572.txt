### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads.
     - Dropping a file into the system's temporary directory.
     - The JavaScript downloader dropping a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL.
     - 'surprise.php' revealing its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscated VBA-Macro Functions:**
     - This is a common technique used to evade detection by security software. Attackers often use obfuscation to hide the true nature of their code.
   - **Decoding JavaScript Payloads:**
     - Once the VBA-Macro is executed, it decodes the JavaScript payload, which is another common step in the attack chain.
   - **Dropping a File into the Temporary Directory:**
     - The decoded JavaScript payload is used to drop a file into the system's temporary directory. This is a typical method for staging malware.
   - **JavaScript Downloader Dropping 'nanagrams.exe':**
     - The JavaScript downloader then downloads a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL. This is a plausible next step, as the downloader would need to fetch the actual malware payload.
   - **'surprise.php' Revealing Visitor Tracking:**
     - The 'surprise.php' file revealing its source code and showing visitor tracking through an iframe is less directly related to the initial steps but could be part of a broader attack strategy. For example, it could be used to track the success of the infection or to gather additional information about the victim.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. The use of obfuscated VBA-Macros, decoding JavaScript payloads, and dropping files into the temporary directory are all common techniques in malware delivery.
   - The additional step of 'surprise.php' revealing visitor tracking through an iframe is also plausible, as it could be part of a multi-stage attack where the initial infection is followed by additional reconnaissance or data exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
