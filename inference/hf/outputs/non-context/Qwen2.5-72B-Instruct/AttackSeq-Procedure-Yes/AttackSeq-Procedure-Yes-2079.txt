### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the RIG Exploit Kit (EK).
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
     - Returning encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.
     - Establishing an encrypted channel for command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using Proxy Servers:**
     - Proxy servers are commonly used by exploit kits to obfuscate the origin of the attack and make it harder to trace back to the attacker. This is a well-documented TTP in the cybersecurity community.
   - **Returning Encrypted Exploit Code:**
     - Encrypting exploit code is a common technique to evade detection by security software. RIG EK has been known to use various encryption methods to protect its payloads.
   - **Custom Version of RC4 Algorithm:**
     - RC4 is a stream cipher that has been widely used in the past, but it has known vulnerabilities. However, using a custom version of RC4 can make it more difficult for security systems to detect and decrypt the traffic.
   - **Establishing an Encrypted Channel for C2:**
     - Establishing an encrypted channel for C2 operations is a standard practice in advanced malware to maintain communication with the attacker's server while evading detection.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. RIG EK is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. The use of proxy servers, encrypted exploit code, and a custom encryption algorithm for C2 communications aligns with the known TTPs of advanced exploit kits.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
