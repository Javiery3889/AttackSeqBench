### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - The Flash file 'show.swf' is mentioned as part of the attack.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Flash file will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion before installing the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spear-phishing email that contains a malicious Flash file ('show.swf'). This file exploits CVE-2015-5119 to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - **Exploitation and Shellcode Execution:** Once the Flash file is executed, it leverages the vulnerability to run shellcode. The purpose of this shellcode is often to perform additional actions, such as Defense Evasion, to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Payload Installation:** After the shellcode is executed, it typically installs the payload. In this case, the payload is embedded in a GIF image.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Initial Access:** The user opens the spear-phishing email and clicks on the malicious Flash file.
     2. **Exploitation:** The Flash file exploits CVE-2015-5119 to gain code execution.
     3. **Shellcode Execution:** The shellcode is executed to perform Defense Evasion techniques, such as disabling security software, creating persistence mechanisms, or obfuscating the attack.
     4. **Payload Installation:** The shellcode then installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

   - **Defense Evasion Before Payload Installation:**
     - It is common for attackers to perform Defense Evasion before installing the payload to ensure that the payload can run undetected and maintain persistence on the system.
     - Therefore, it is likely that the shellcode will attempt to perform Defense Evasion before installing the payload.

### Final Answer:
