### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Machete malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery**: Detecting newly inserted devices, producing file listings for exfiltration, and gathering browser data.
     - **Data Collection**: Potentially using screen capture.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Communication**: Leveraging FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C2 servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery**: The initial steps of detecting newly inserted devices, producing file listings, and gathering browser data are typical discovery techniques used by malware to understand the environment and identify valuable data.
   - **Data Collection**: Screen capture is a common technique used by malware to collect additional data, such as visual information that might be useful for the attacker. This can include capturing sensitive information displayed on the screen, such as login credentials or sensitive documents.
   - **C2 Communication**: Using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C2 servers is a common method for exfiltrating data and receiving commands from the attacker.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs, it is plausible that after performing discovery and gathering browser data, the malware would use screen capture to collect additional data before exfiltrating it via FTP and HTTP.
   - Screen capture can provide valuable visual information that complements the data collected during the discovery phase.

### Final Answer:
