### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Carbanak group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using the Cobalt Strike beacon for network discovery and mapping.
     - Moving laterally across the infrastructure to target internal hosts and servers.
     - Preparing and collecting documents related to internal applications and procedures.
     - Exfiltrating the collected documents.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - The sequence aligns with common attack patterns observed in advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Carbanak.
     - Network discovery and mapping are often the first steps in an APT attack to understand the target environment.
     - Lateral movement is a common next step to gain access to more systems and data.
     - Collecting and exfiltrating sensitive documents is a typical final step in such attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely.
     - This choice would imply that the Carbanak group did not follow a logical and common attack pattern, which is less likely given the sophistication of the group.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with known APT attack patterns.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
