### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying malware to search for sensitive documents.
     - Taking screenshots during the collection phase.
     - The question asks whether the harvested documents and screenshots are automatically uploaded to the C&C (Command and Control) server during the exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware automatically uploads the collected data to the C&C server.
     - This is a common TTP in many cyber attacks, where malware is designed to exfiltrate data without further human intervention.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware does not automatically upload the collected data to the C&C server.
     - This would imply that the data is stored locally and requires manual intervention to be exfiltrated.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Gamaredon Group's TTPs:**
     - The Gamaredon group is known for using sophisticated malware that can automate various stages of the attack lifecycle.
     - Their malware often includes features for automated data exfiltration to ensure that collected data is efficiently and reliably sent to the C&C server.
   - **Automated Exfiltration:**
     - Automated exfiltration is a common and efficient method for ensuring that collected data is promptly and securely transferred to the attacker's infrastructure.
     - Manual exfiltration would be less efficient and more prone to errors or detection.

### Final Answer:
Given the known TTPs of the Gamaredon group and the efficiency of automated exfiltration, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
