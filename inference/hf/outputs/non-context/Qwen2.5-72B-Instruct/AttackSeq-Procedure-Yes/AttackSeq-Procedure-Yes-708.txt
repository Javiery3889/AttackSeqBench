### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware like Aumlib and Ixeshe.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading detection by altering HTTP communication patterns through encoding techniques.
     - Downloading updated samples from specific URLs.
     - Sharing code with an older variant as part of command and control (C2) activity.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Evading Detection:** Malware often uses encoding techniques to alter HTTP communication patterns to avoid detection by security systems. This is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Command and Control" and "Defense Evasion" tactics.
       - **Downloading Updated Samples:** Malware frequently downloads updated versions of itself from specific URLs to maintain persistence and evade detection. This is part of the "Command and Control" tactic.
       - **Sharing Code with Older Variants:** Malware variants often share code to maintain consistency and reduce development time. This can also help in evading detection by making it harder to distinguish between different variants.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice would imply that the malware does not engage in these common TTPs, which is less likely given the known behavior of sophisticated malware like Aumlib and Ixeshe.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with known behaviors of sophisticated malware.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
