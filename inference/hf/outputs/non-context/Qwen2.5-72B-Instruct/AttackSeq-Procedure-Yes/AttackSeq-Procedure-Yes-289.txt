### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dropping Elephant backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts.
     - Using the PowerShell scripts to download additional malware.
   - The question then asks if the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to iterate through password stores and steal the user's Google Chrome credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to iterate through password stores and steal Google Chrome credentials.
     - This is plausible because:
       - Once the backdoor has evaded defenses and downloaded additional malware, it is common for malware to perform credential theft as part of its post-exploitation activities.
       - Stealing browser credentials, including those from Google Chrome, is a common technique used by many backdoors and malware to gain further access to user data and accounts.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is not likely to iterate through password stores and steal Google Chrome credentials.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - Credential theft is a common and valuable activity for malware, especially after gaining initial access and downloading additional payloads.
       - The Dropping Elephant backdoor, like many other sophisticated malware, often includes a range of post-exploitation activities, including credential theft.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common practices of malware and the typical behavior of backdoors like Dropping Elephant, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes credential theft.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
