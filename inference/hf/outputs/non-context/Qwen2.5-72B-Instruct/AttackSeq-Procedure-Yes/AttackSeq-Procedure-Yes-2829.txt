### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR).
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will evade detection by executing before the Windows operating system fully loads, thereby bypassing typical operating system integrity checks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Volume Boot Record (VBR) Infection:**
     - The VBR is a critical part of the boot process. It contains the code that is executed by the BIOS to load the operating system.
     - By infecting the VBR, the malware can ensure that it is executed very early in the boot process, before the operating system is fully loaded.
   - **Evasion of Detection:**
     - Malware that executes before the operating system fully loads can often evade detection by security software that relies on the operating system to function.
     - Typical operating system integrity checks, such as those performed by Windows, are not active until the operating system is fully loaded.
   - **Nemesis Bootkit:**
     - The Nemesis bootkit is known for its ability to infect the VBR and execute early in the boot process, making it difficult for security software to detect and remove it.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the Nemesis bootkit infects the VBR and executes before the operating system fully loads, it is highly likely that it will evade detection by bypassing typical operating system integrity checks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
