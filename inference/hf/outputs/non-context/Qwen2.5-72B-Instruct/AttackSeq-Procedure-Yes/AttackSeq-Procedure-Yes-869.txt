### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial access methods used by the GreyEnergy group before they employ stealth techniques like partial AES-256 encryption of modules for defense evasion.
   - The attack sequence described involves gaining initial access and then using stealth techniques to move laterally and maintain persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy will first gain initial access through vectors such as spearphishing or compromised public-facing web servers.
     - This is a common and logical sequence in many cyber attacks. Initial access is often gained through social engineering techniques like spearphishing or by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy will not use these initial access methods before employing stealth techniques.
     - This is less likely because gaining initial access is a crucial first step in any targeted attack. Without initial access, the attackers cannot deploy their stealth techniques.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** Initial access is a critical first step in any cyber attack. Attackers need a foothold in the target network to begin their operations.
   - **Step 2:** GreyEnergy, like many advanced threat groups, often uses spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers to gain initial access. These methods are effective and commonly used in targeted attacks.
   - **Step 3:** Once initial access is gained, the attackers can then deploy stealth techniques such as partial AES-256 encryption of modules to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Step 4:** Therefore, it is highly likely that GreyEnergy will first gain initial access through these vectors before employing stealth techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
