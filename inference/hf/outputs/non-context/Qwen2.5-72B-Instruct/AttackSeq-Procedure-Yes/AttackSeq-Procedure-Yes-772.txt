### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Sending spear phishing emails.
     - The emails contain links to RTF (Rich Text Format) documents.
     - The RTF documents exploit CVE-2017-8750.
     - The exploit is used to deliver QuasarRAT (Remote Access Trojan).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the recipients will see a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report before being infected with QuasarRAT.
     - This is a common tactic in spear phishing attacks to make the document appear legitimate and increase the likelihood of the recipient opening it and triggering the exploit.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the recipients will not see a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report before being infected with QuasarRAT.
     - This would imply that the exploit is triggered immediately upon opening the RTF document, without any additional social engineering elements.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Spear Phishing and Social Engineering:**
     - Spear phishing attacks often use social engineering techniques to make the payload (in this case, the RTF document) appear legitimate.
     - Presenting a document that simulates a legitimate blog post or report is a common social engineering tactic to lower the recipient's guard and increase the likelihood of them interacting with the document.
   - **Exploit Delivery:**
     - The exploit (CVE-2017-8750) is designed to be triggered when the RTF document is opened.
     - However, the exploit can be embedded in a document that appears legitimate to the user, which is a common practice to ensure the user opens the document.
   - **QuasarRAT Delivery:**
     - Once the exploit is triggered, QuasarRAT can be delivered to the target system.
     - The presence of a legitimate-looking document can help in this process by making the user more likely to open the document and trigger the exploit.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
