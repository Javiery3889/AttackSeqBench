### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where badbullzvenom uses the Golden Chickens malware suite to target corporate employees on LinkedIn with fake job offers.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the Golden Chickens malware will evade detection by most antivirus companies due to its stealthy design.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Golden Chickens malware is designed to evade detection by most antivirus companies.
     - Malware designed for targeted attacks often includes advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection by security software.
     - The use of a sophisticated malware suite like Golden Chickens, which is known for its stealth, aligns with the goal of evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Golden Chickens malware will not evade detection by most antivirus companies.
     - This is less likely given the context of the question, which emphasizes the malware's stealthy design and the sophistication of the attack.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the Golden Chickens malware is part of a targeted attack and is known for its stealthy design, it is more plausible that it would include features to evade detection by antivirus software.
   - Advanced malware often uses techniques such as code obfuscation, polymorphism, and living off the land (using legitimate system tools) to avoid detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
