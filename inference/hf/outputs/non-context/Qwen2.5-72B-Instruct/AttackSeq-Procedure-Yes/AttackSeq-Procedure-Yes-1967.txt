### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the StellarParticle campaign.
   - The campaign involved discovery activities using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to gather Active Directory (AD) information.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The use of AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to gather AD information is a common technique for reconnaissance and discovery. This helps the threat actor understand the network structure and identify potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is a critical phase in many cyber attacks, where the threat actor moves from one system to another within the network to gain access to more resources.
     - RDP is a common method for lateral movement, especially in environments where RDP is enabled and credentials are available.
   - **Use of Privileged and Non-Privileged Accounts:**
     - Threat actors often use a combination of privileged and non-privileged accounts to move laterally. Non-privileged accounts can be used to gain initial access and perform initial reconnaissance, while privileged accounts are used to access more sensitive systems and data.
     - Using both types of accounts can help the threat actor avoid detection and maintain persistence in the network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the described sequence of TTPs, it is highly likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories. This approach aligns with common cyber attack strategies and the use of multiple account types to achieve the desired objectives.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
