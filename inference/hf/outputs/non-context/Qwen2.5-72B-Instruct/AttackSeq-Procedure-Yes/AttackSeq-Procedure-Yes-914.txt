### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Tuyul malware will execute Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2017-9841**: This is a known vulnerability in PHPUnit, a popular PHP testing framework. Exploiting this vulnerability can allow an attacker to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tuyul Malware**: Tuyul is a type of malware known for its ability to perform various malicious activities, including executing scripts and maintaining persistence.
   - **Executing Perl Scripts and Shell Commands**: Malware often uses these techniques to perform various tasks, such as setting up backdoors, downloading additional payloads, or executing malicious commands.
   - **Periodically Downloading a Bash Script Named 'cron'**: This is a common technique for maintaining persistence. By using a cron job, the malware can ensure it runs at regular intervals, making it harder to detect and remove.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access**: Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access is a plausible first step.
   - **Executing Perl Scripts and Shell Commands**: Once the initial access is gained, it is common for malware to execute additional scripts to set up the environment and perform further actions.
   - **Maintaining Persistence**: Downloading a bash script named 'cron' and setting up a cron job is a typical method for maintaining persistence. This ensures that the malware continues to run even if the system is restarted.

Given the typical behavior of malware and the specific techniques mentioned, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible.
