### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an adversary named Vyveva.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery**: Obtaining file and directory listings and listing running processes.
     - **Defense Evasion**: Encrypting strings and components within artifacts.
     - **Collection**: Compressing and collecting files for exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase**: The adversary is gathering information about the system, such as file and directory listings and running processes. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the environment.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Encrypting strings and components within artifacts is a technique used to avoid detection by security tools. This is often done to hide the true nature of the malware or to make it harder for defenders to analyze.
   - **Collection Phase**: Compressing and collecting files for exfiltration is a logical next step after the adversary has identified valuable data during the Discovery phase.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression:
     - **Discovery** helps the adversary understand what is available on the system.
     - **Defense Evasion** helps the adversary avoid detection while preparing for the next steps.
     - **Collection** involves gathering the identified data for exfiltration.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the logical progression and the common use of encryption for defense evasion, it is reasonable to assume that Vyveva would encrypt strings and components within its artifacts before compressing and collecting files for exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
