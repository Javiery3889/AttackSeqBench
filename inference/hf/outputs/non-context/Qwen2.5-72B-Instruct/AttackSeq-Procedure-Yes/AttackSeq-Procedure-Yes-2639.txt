### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that involve:
     - Stealing clipboard contents.
     - Capturing screenshots.
     - Staging encrypted data in a temporary folder.
   - The question then asks if Machete, a known malware, is likely to automatically exfiltrate all collected files to remote servers and the C&C (Command and Control) server using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Machete will automatically exfiltrate the collected files using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Machete will not automatically exfiltrate the collected files using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Machete Malware:**
     - Machete is a sophisticated piece of malware known for its capabilities in data exfiltration.
     - It often uses encrypted and compressed transmission methods to avoid detection and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the exfiltrated data.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described (stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging encrypted data) aligns with the typical behavior of Machete.
     - After collecting and staging the data, it is highly likely that Machete would automatically exfiltrate the data to remote servers and the C&C server to complete its mission.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Machete and its known capabilities, it is highly plausible that it would automatically exfiltrate the collected files using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
