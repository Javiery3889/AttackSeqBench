### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a malware downloader app from a fraudulent website.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries to retrieve reconnaissance and RAT (Remote Access Tool) tools as part of the execution phase before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access was achieved by tricking users into downloading a malware downloader app. This aligns with the TTP of using a malicious app to gain a foothold in the victim's system.
   - **Execution Phase:** The execution phase typically involves the malware performing its intended actions, such as downloading additional tools or executing binaries.
   - **Retrieval of Tools:** It is common for malware to download additional tools, such as reconnaissance tools and RATs, to further compromise the system and gather information.
   - **Reconnaissance via 'bird.exe':** The use of 'bird.exe' for reconnaissance is a specific tool that the malware might use to collect detailed victim host information. This aligns with the reconnaissance phase of the attack.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common attack pattern. After gaining initial access, the malware downloader would likely execute binaries to download additional tools, including reconnaissance and RAT tools, before conducting reconnaissance.
   - The use of 'bird.exe' for reconnaissance is consistent with the typical behavior of malware in the execution and reconnaissance phases.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
