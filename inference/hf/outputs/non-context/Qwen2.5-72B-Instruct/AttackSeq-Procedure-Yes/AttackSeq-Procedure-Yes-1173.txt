### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access scenario where APT29 uses publicly available exploits to gain a foothold.
   - It then asks whether APT29 is likely to drop further tooling or obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - APT29, like many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, often uses a combination of techniques to maintain persistence and expand their foothold within a network.
     - After gaining initial access, APT29 is known to use various methods to maintain persistence, including dropping additional tools and obtaining legitimate credentials.
     - Dropping further tooling can help in establishing a more robust presence and in performing additional tasks such as lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - Obtaining legitimate credentials can help in maintaining access over a longer period and in evading detection by security systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that APT29 would not take additional steps to maintain persistence after gaining initial access.
     - This is less likely because maintaining persistence is a critical aspect of APT operations, and APT29 is known for its sophisticated and persistent tactics.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known behavior of APT29 and the importance of maintaining persistence in APT operations, the most plausible answer is that APT29 will indeed drop further tooling or obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
