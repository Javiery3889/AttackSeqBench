### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor MuddyWater.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Utilizing command and control (C2) servers in Pakistan and China.
     - Hosting malicious code on these C2 servers.
     - Communicating with compromised systems.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that MuddyWater will leverage a specific Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access to target governmental entities and the telecommunication sector.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2017-0199** is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine by tricking the user into opening a specially crafted document. This vulnerability has been widely used in various cyber attacks, particularly in spear-phishing campaigns.
   - MuddyWater is known for using various TTPs to gain initial access, including spear-phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities in widely used software.
   - Given that MuddyWater has a history of targeting governmental entities and the telecommunication sector, and that CVE-2017-0199 is a well-known and effective method for initial access, it is plausible that MuddyWater would leverage this vulnerability.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that MuddyWater would leverage CVE-2017-0199 to gain initial access to target governmental entities and the telecommunication sector.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
