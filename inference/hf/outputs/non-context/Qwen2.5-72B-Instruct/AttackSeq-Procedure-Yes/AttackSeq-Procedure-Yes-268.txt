### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Initial access via a Microsoft Word document exploiting CVE-2017-0199.
     2. Execution of an embedded .hta file using mshta.exe.
     3. Achieving persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2017-0199:**
     - This vulnerability in Microsoft Office allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted RTF file. The file can contain an embedded .hta (HTML Application) file.
   - **Execution of .hta file using mshta.exe:**
     - mshta.exe is a legitimate Windows application used to execute HTML Applications. It is commonly abused by attackers to execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - Scheduling a task to run a VBS file every 3 minutes is a common technique for achieving persistence. The task name 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' is likely chosen to blend in with legitimate system tasks.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-0199 to gain initial access is a well-documented technique. When a user opens the malicious Word document, the embedded .hta file is executed.
   - **Execution of .hta file:**
     - The .hta file is typically executed using mshta.exe, which is a common and expected behavior in this type of attack.
   - **Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access and executing the .hta file, the attacker would likely want to maintain persistence. Scheduling a task to run a VBS file every 3 minutes is a plausible and effective method to achieve this.

### Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
