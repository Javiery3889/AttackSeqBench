### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that the Sayad malware might follow.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Gathering system information, open ports, and browser data.
     - **Collection Phase:** Collecting keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** Uploading the encrypted data to a malicious web server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where the malware gathers information about the system to understand its environment and identify potential targets.
   - **Collection Phase:** After discovering the system, it is logical for the malware to collect sensitive data. Keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media are typical targets for data collection in malware attacks.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** Once the data is collected, the next logical step is to exfiltrate it. Encrypting the data before exfiltration is a common technique to avoid detection and ensure the data remains confidential during transmission.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Discovery:** Gather system information.
     2. **Collection:** Collect sensitive data.
     3. **Exfiltration:** Encrypt and upload the data.
   - This sequence aligns well with the typical behavior of malware, including Sayad.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
