### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that involve reconnaissance activities, followed by the installation of a malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) through employee-enabled macro execution, and then the establishment of communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods.
   - **Initial Access:** Installation of BlackEnergy 3 through employee-enabled macro execution.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Establishing communication with C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of malware like BlackEnergy 3. Once installed, such malware often establishes a backdoor to communicate with C2 servers to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is unlikely that BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.
     - This is less plausible because the primary purpose of malware like BlackEnergy 3 is to maintain persistence and communicate with C2 servers to carry out the attacker's objectives.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible answer is that BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
