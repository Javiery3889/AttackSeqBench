### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - A malicious XLS (Excel) attachment.
     - The XLS attachment contains a VB (Visual Basic) macro.
     - The VB macro is used to silently download a malicious MSI (Microsoft Installer) package.
     - The MSI package is then executed.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK (Shortcut) file for autorun at Windows Startup.
     - **Persistence** is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and one of the techniques used for persistence is **"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution"** (T1547).
     - One of the sub-techniques under T1547 is **"Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder"** (T1547.001), which involves placing a shortcut (LNK) file in the Windows Startup folder to ensure that the malicious software runs automatically when the user logs in.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that it is likely the MSI package will install an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
     - Given the context of the attack, it is plausible that the attackers would want to ensure the malware persists across reboots and user logins. Installing an LNK file in the Startup folder is a common and effective method to achieve this.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This answer suggests that it is unlikely the MSI package will install an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
     - While it is possible that the attackers might use a different method for persistence, the described sequence of TTPs aligns well with the use of an LNK file for autorun.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
