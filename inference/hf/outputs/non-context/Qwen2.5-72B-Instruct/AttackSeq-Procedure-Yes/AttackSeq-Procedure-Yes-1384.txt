### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals use tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys to identify potential entry points into medical networks.
   - The focus is on whether these tools are likely to discover outdated Building Management Systems (BMS) and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the network perimeter.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Masscan:** This is a fast port scanner that can quickly identify open ports and services on a network. It is commonly used in the reconnaissance phase to find potential entry points.
       - **Shodan and Censys:** These are search engines that index internet-connected devices and services. They are particularly useful for identifying exposed systems and devices, including BMS and medical devices.
       - **Outdated Systems and MQTT Protocol:** BMS and medical devices are often found to be outdated and may support protocols like MQTT, which can be insecure if not properly configured. These devices are frequently exposed to the internet, making them potential targets for reconnaissance.
       - Given the capabilities of these tools and the common vulnerabilities in BMS and medical devices, it is highly likely that the cybercriminals would discover such systems.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This answer suggests that it is unlikely for the cybercriminals to discover outdated BMS and medical devices supporting MQTT on the network perimeter.
       - However, given the widespread use of these tools and the known vulnerabilities in such systems, this answer is less plausible.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible answer is that the cybercriminals are likely to discover outdated BMS and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the network perimeter.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
