### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Emissary Trojan.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by creating registry keys.
     - Storing a unique GUID for the compromised host.
     - Hijacking legitimate services.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the authors will update the Trojan to evade detection by recompiling it without changing the PE (Portable Executable) header hashes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:**
     - Creating registry keys and hijacking legitimate services are common persistence techniques used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes is a less effective method of evasion. PE header hashes are often used by security tools to identify and detect malware.
     - More effective evasion techniques include:
       - Changing the PE header hashes.
       - Using packers or crypters to obfuscate the code.
       - Employing polymorphic or metamorphic code to change the binary signature.
   - **Likelihood of the Described Update:**
     - If the authors are sophisticated, they are more likely to use more advanced evasion techniques rather than simply recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes.
     - Recompiling without changing the PE header hashes would not significantly improve the Trojan's ability to evade detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophistication of modern malware authors and the effectiveness of more advanced evasion techniques, it is unlikely that the authors would update the Trojan in the described manner.

**Final Answer: B: No**
