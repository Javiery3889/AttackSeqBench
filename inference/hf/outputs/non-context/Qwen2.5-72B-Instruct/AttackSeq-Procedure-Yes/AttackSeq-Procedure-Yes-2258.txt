### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Cosmic Banker group uses a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department to deliver a malicious attachment.
   - The attachment is a COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file.
   - The question asks if it is likely that this .bat file will execute a PowerShell script before establishing persistence through shortcuts in the startup folder and scheduled tasks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a phishing email, which is a common initial access technique (T1566).
     - The email delivers a malicious .bat file, which is a common payload for initial execution (T1059).

   - **Execution of PowerShell Script:**
     - .bat files can be used to execute PowerShell scripts. This is a common technique to run more complex commands or scripts (T1059.001).
     - PowerShell is often used for various malicious activities, including downloading additional payloads, executing commands, and establishing persistence (T1086).

   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - Creating shortcuts in the startup folder (T1060) and manipulating scheduled tasks (T1053) are common persistence techniques.
     - These actions are typically performed after gaining initial access and executing the initial payload to ensure the malware remains active even after the system is restarted.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker uses a phishing email to deliver a .bat file.
     2. **Execution:** The .bat file is likely to execute a PowerShell script to perform further actions.
     3. **Persistence:** After gaining a foothold, the attacker establishes persistence by creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
