### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the LightNeuron malware.
   - The initial actions include discovering system network configurations using functions like `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that LightNeuron will collect emails and local files for eventual exfiltration via its backdoor functions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` are functions used to gather information about the network configuration and the name of the computer. This is a common initial step in many malware operations to understand the environment in which it is operating.
   - **Subsequent Actions:**
     - The question asks if LightNeuron is likely to collect emails and local files for exfiltration.
     - LightNeuron is known to be a sophisticated backdoor that can perform various malicious activities, including data exfiltration.
     - Given its capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that after gathering initial system information, LightNeuron would proceed to collect sensitive data such as emails and local files for exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known capabilities of LightNeuron and the logical progression of its actions, it is likely that LightNeuron would collect emails and local files for eventual exfiltration via its backdoor functions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
