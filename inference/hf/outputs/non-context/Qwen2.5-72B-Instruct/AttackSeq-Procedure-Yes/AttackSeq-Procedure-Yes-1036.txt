### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Emissary Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Network reconnaissance to identify systems vulnerable to EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144).
     2. Exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers for initial access.
     3. Uploading Mimikatz and custom backdoors such as HyperBro for execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144):**
     - This is a critical vulnerability in the Windows SMB (Server Message Block) protocol that allows remote code execution.
     - It is often used for initial access and lateral movement within a network.
   - **Microsoft SharePoint Vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604):**
     - This is a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint.
     - It can be used to gain initial access to a web server by uploading a webshell.
   - **Webshells:**
     - Webshells are scripts that provide a web-based interface for attackers to execute commands on a compromised server.
   - **Mimikatz:**
     - A tool used to extract credentials and other sensitive information from memory.
   - **HyperBro:**
     - A custom backdoor used for maintaining persistence and remote access.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Network Reconnaissance:**
     - Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance to identify systems vulnerable to EternalBlue. This is a common first step in many attack sequences.
   - **Exploiting SharePoint Vulnerability:**
     - After identifying vulnerable systems, the next step is to gain initial access. Exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells is a plausible next step.
   - **Uploading Tools:**
     - Once initial access is gained, the attacker would likely upload tools like Mimikatz and custom backdoors such as HyperBro to further compromise the system and maintain persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and aligns with known TTPs of advanced threat actors.
   - It is plausible that Emissary Panda would exploit the SharePoint vulnerability after performing network reconnaissance to gain initial access and then upload additional tools.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
