### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Konni APT Group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Gaining initial access via the download of an ISO file containing malicious scripts.
     2. Executing deobfuscated batch and VBScript files.
     3. Scheduling a VBScript file to run.
     4. Ensuring the VBScript file runs every 33 minutes if a specific file exists in the directory.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Let's evaluate the plausibility:
       - **Initial Access:** Downloading an ISO file containing malicious scripts is a common method for initial access.
       - **Execution of Scripts:** Deobfuscating and executing batch and VBScript files is a typical next step to establish a foothold.
       - **Scheduling:** Scheduling a script to run periodically is a common technique for persistence.
       - **Conditional Execution:** Ensuring the script runs only if a specific file exists is a plausible way to avoid detection and maintain control.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - Let's evaluate the plausibility:
       - The sequence described is consistent with known APT group behaviors, particularly those of the Konni APT Group.
       - There is no clear reason to doubt the plausibility of the sequence based on the information provided.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with known APT group behaviors, particularly the Konni APT Group.
   - Each step in the sequence (initial access, execution of scripts, scheduling, and conditional execution) is a plausible and logical progression of actions.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Konni APT Group would follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
