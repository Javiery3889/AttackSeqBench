### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the NetTraveler malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Persistence:** Registering the main C&C module "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL" as a service named "Windowsupdata."
     - **Anti-Debugging/Anti-Analysis:** Using mutexes like "SD_2013 Is Running!" to prevent multiple instances of itself.
     - **Obfuscation:** Using a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** Registering a service is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. This is a plausible and common TTP.
   - **Anti-Debugging/Anti-Analysis:** Using mutexes to prevent multiple instances of the malware from running is a common technique to avoid detection and analysis. This is also a plausible TTP.
   - **Obfuscation:** Malware often uses encryption or obfuscation to hide its configuration and C&C server information. This is a common technique to avoid detection and make analysis more difficult. Using a simple encryption scheme is a plausible TTP, especially for less sophisticated malware or to balance between complexity and effectiveness.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence and Anti-Debugging/Anti-Analysis:** These TTPs are well-documented and commonly used in malware. They are essential for ensuring the malware remains active and undetected.
   - **Obfuscation:** While the question specifies a "simple encryption scheme," this is still a plausible TTP. Malware often uses various levels of encryption to protect its configuration and C&C server information. A simple encryption scheme can be effective in preventing casual analysis and is a common practice.

### Final Answer
Given the commonality and plausibility of the described TTPs, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
