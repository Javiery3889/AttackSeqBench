### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a zero-day exploit is used in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Using a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
   - **Malware Delivery:** Infection with Plexor malware.
   - **Post-Exploitation:** Avoiding detection, system fingerprinting, and discovery.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Longhorn's tools will indeed follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.
     - This is plausible because sophisticated malware, especially those used in espionage, often includes mechanisms to avoid detection. These mechanisms can include techniques like:
       - **Living off the Land (LotL):** Using legitimate system tools to blend in with normal activity.
       - **Process Injection:** Injecting malicious code into legitimate processes to avoid detection.
       - **Stealth Communication:** Using encrypted channels or mimicking legitimate network traffic.
       - **System Fingerprinting and Discovery:** Once the malware is in place and has avoided detection, it will likely gather information about the system to understand its environment and plan further actions.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Longhorn's tools will not follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.
     - This is less plausible because avoiding detection is a critical step in maintaining the persistence and effectiveness of the malware. Without avoiding detection, the malware is more likely to be identified and removed, which would compromise the entire operation.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Plexor malware and the context of espionage, it is highly likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery. This is a standard practice in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations to ensure the malware remains undetected and can gather valuable information over an extended period.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
