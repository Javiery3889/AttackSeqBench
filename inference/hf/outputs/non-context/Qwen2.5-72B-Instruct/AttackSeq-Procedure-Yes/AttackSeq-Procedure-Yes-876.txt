### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the Musical Chairs campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a signed executable to load a malicious DLL.
     - Launching the actual Gh0st DLL in the execution phase.
     - Embedding the Tetris game to evade debuggers.
     - Establishing new command-and-control (C2) infrastructure using domains like etybh[.]com.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using a signed executable to load a malicious DLL:**
     - This is a common technique to bypass security mechanisms by leveraging trusted executables. It aligns with the initial stages of an attack where the malware needs to execute without raising immediate suspicion.
   - **Launching the actual Gh0st DLL in the execution phase:**
     - Gh0st is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT). Loading it as a DLL is a typical method to maintain persistence and gain remote control over the compromised system.
   - **Embedding the Tetris game to evade debuggers:**
     - This is an unusual and specific technique. While it is possible to use such methods to evade detection, it is not a common or widely documented technique in the context of the Musical Chairs campaign.
   - **Establishing new command-and-control infrastructure using domains like etybh[.]com:**
     - Establishing C2 infrastructure is a crucial step in maintaining control over the compromised system. Using domain names like etybh[.]com is a plausible method for C2 communication.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The first two steps (using a signed executable and launching Gh0st DLL) are well-documented and align with typical APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) behavior.
   - The third step (embedding the Tetris game to evade debuggers) is highly specific and not commonly associated with the Musical Chairs campaign. It seems more like a creative or experimental technique rather than a standard practice.
   - The fourth step (establishing C2 infrastructure) is a logical and necessary part of the attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Given the unusual and specific nature of embedding the Tetris game to evade debuggers, it is less likely that this step would be part of the Musical Chairs campaign's standard TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
