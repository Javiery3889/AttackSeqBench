### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that Regin, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) malware, might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
     - Scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase.
   - The question then asks if Regin is likely to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes after these initial steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization:**
     - This is a common technique used in the discovery phase to understand the target environment better. It helps the attacker identify running processes, memory usage, and other system details.
   - **Scanning for Deleted Files:**
     - This is also a discovery technique, often used to find sensitive information that might have been deleted but is still recoverable.
   - **Monitoring Network Traffic and Sniffing Low-Level Network Traffic:**
     - This is a collection technique. After understanding the target environment, attackers often move to collect data, which can include monitoring network traffic to capture sensitive information, credentials, or other valuable data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Regin is known for its sophisticated capabilities and multi-stage attack process. It often follows a structured approach to gather information, understand the target, and then collect data.
   - The sequence described in the question (discovery followed by collection) is a logical and common progression in APT attacks.
   - Given Regin's advanced nature and its known capabilities, it is highly likely that after the initial discovery phase, it would proceed to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
