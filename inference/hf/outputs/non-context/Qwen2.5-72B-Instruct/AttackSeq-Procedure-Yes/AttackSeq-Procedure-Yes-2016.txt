### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Welcome Chat app.
   - The app ensures persistence by auto-starting at device boot through listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.
   - The question asks whether the app is likely to collect device information such as GPS location before uploading the exfiltrated data to its C&C (Command and Control) server using the HTTP protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - The app ensures persistence by listening for the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast, which is a common technique to ensure that the app starts automatically when the device boots up. This is a typical TTP for malware to maintain a foothold on the device.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - Collecting device information such as GPS location is a common next step after ensuring persistence. Malware often gathers various types of data to exfiltrate, and GPS location is a valuable piece of information for attackers.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Uploading the exfiltrated data to a C&C server using the HTTP protocol is a common method for data exfiltration. HTTP is often used because it is a standard protocol that is less likely to be blocked by firewalls or other network security measures.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (ensuring persistence, collecting device information, and exfiltrating data) is a logical and common sequence of TTPs for malware.
   - Given the context, it is highly likely that the app would collect device information such as GPS location before uploading the exfiltrated data to its C&C server.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
