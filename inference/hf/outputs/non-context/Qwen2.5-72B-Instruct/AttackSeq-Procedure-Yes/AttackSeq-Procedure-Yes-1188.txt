### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through phishing emails containing malicious MS Office documents.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls before a macro downloads malicious payloads from the threat actor's C2 infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing Emails with Malicious MS Office Documents:**
     - This is a common initial access technique (T1566: Phishing) where attackers use social engineering to trick victims into opening and enabling macros in malicious documents.
   - **Disabling Security Controls:**
     - Disabling security controls (T1089: Disabling Security Tools) is a technique that can be used to reduce the risk of detection and to ensure that the malicious payload can execute without interference.
   - **Macro Downloading Malicious Payloads:**
     - Once the macro is enabled, it can be used to download additional malicious payloads from the C2 infrastructure (T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer).

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining initial access through a phishing email, the attacker might instruct the victim to disable security controls to ensure that the macro can run without being blocked by security software.
     - However, it is more common for the macro itself to attempt to disable security controls automatically rather than instructing the victim to do so manually. This is because most victims are not technically savvy enough to disable security controls on their own.
   - **Practical Considerations:**
     - Instructing victims to disable security controls manually is less common because it increases the risk of detection and requires a higher level of technical knowledge from the victim.
     - Automated methods are more reliable and less likely to be noticed by the victim.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The most plausible sequence is that the macro would attempt to disable security controls automatically rather than instructing the victim to do so manually.
