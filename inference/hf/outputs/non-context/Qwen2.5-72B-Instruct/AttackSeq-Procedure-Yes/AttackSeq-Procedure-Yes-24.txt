### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Machete malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by creating a task named 'Microsoft_up'.
     - Storing the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Malware Storage:**
     - Creating a task named 'Microsoft_up' and storing the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/' are common techniques used by malware to ensure it runs automatically and remains hidden.
   - **Collection Capabilities:**
     - The question asks if Machete is likely to copy files to a special USB device as part of its collection capabilities.
     - Machete is known for its data exfiltration capabilities, but the specific method of copying files to a special USB device is not a widely documented technique for this malware.
     - Typically, Machete uses network-based exfiltration methods to send data to a remote server.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known TTPs of Machete, it is less likely that it would copy files to a special USB device as part of its collection capabilities. The more common method is network-based exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
