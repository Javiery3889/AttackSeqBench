### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elise malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery:** Collecting system information such as IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Communicating with a hardcoded C2 server using an application layer protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the discovery phase, the malware will communicate with the C2 server.
     - This is a common sequence in malware operations. After gathering information about the system, the malware often needs to report back to the C2 server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate the collected data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not communicate with the C2 server after the discovery phase.
     - This is less likely because the primary purpose of collecting system information is often to send it back to the attacker for further analysis or to receive additional commands.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a typical attack pattern where malware first gathers information about the compromised system and then communicates with a C2 server to report the findings or receive further instructions.
   - Therefore, it is highly plausible that the Elise malware will communicate with the hardcoded C2 server after the discovery phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
