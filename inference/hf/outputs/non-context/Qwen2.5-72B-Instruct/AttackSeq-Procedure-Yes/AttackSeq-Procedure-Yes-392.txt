### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Vyveva's backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Obtaining system information (computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and local IP address).
     - Collecting files from the computer.
     - Compressing the collected files with zlib.
     - Transmitting the compressed files to the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will indeed collect files from the computer before compressing them with zlib and transmitting them to the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not collect files from the computer before compressing and transmitting them.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Obtaining System Information:**
     - This is a common initial step in many malware operations. The backdoor gathers information about the infected system to understand its environment and capabilities.
   - **Collecting Files:**
     - After gathering system information, it is logical for the backdoor to collect files of interest. This could include sensitive documents, credentials, or other valuable data.
   - **Compressing Files:**
     - Compressing the collected files with zlib is a common technique to reduce the size of the data being transmitted, making it more efficient and less likely to be detected by network monitoring tools.
   - **Transmitting to C&C Server:**
     - Finally, the compressed files are sent to the C&C server for further processing or exfiltration.

   Given the logical sequence of actions described, it is highly plausible that the backdoor would collect files before compressing and transmitting them.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
