### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence starts with the use of the Responder tool to achieve credential access.
   - The question then asks if the group is likely to conduct discovery activities (such as system service discovery) before using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Responder Tool for Credential Access:**
     - The Responder tool is commonly used to capture network credentials, such as NTLM hashes, by responding to network requests for authentication.
     - This is a typical initial step in many cyber attacks to gain access to valid credentials.

   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - After gaining credentials, it is common for attackers to perform discovery activities to understand the network environment, identify valuable targets, and gather information about the systems and services running on the network.
     - Discovery activities can include system service discovery, network scanning, and enumeration of user accounts and permissions.

   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Once the attacker has a better understanding of the network, they may use various techniques for lateral movement, such as using Windows commands (e.g., `net use`, `psexec`) and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.
     - Lateral movement is typically performed after discovery to ensure that the attacker can move through the network efficiently and target specific systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks, it is highly likely that the Lazarus group would conduct discovery activities before moving laterally. This is because discovery provides the necessary information to make lateral movement more effective and targeted.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: credential access → discovery → lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
