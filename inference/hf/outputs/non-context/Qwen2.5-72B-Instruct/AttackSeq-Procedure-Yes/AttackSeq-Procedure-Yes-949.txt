### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves the following steps:
     1. **Collection Phase:** The malware scans for files and stages data for exfiltration.
     2. **Exfiltration Phase:** Data is sent to a primary C&C (Command and Control) server over commonly used ports.
     3. **Fallback Mechanism:** If the primary C&C server is not available, a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration becomes operational for communications.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before a fallback C&C server is used.
     - This is a plausible sequence because:
       - **Primary C&C Server:** Attackers often use a primary C&C server to maintain control and exfiltrate data.
       - **Commonly Used Ports:** Using commonly used ports (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) helps to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.
       - **Fallback C&C Server:** If the primary C&C server is compromised or unavailable, a fallback C&C server is a common redundancy mechanism to ensure continued control and data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that data will not be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before a fallback C&C server is used.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - It implies that the malware would skip the primary C&C server and immediately use the fallback C&C server, which is less efficient and less common in attack sequences.
       - It would also mean that the malware is not using commonly used ports, which is less likely as it would make the data exfiltration more noticeable and easier to detect.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports before a fallback C&C server is used.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
