### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
     - Using a backdoor to list interesting files, such as Office documents, during the discovery phase.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Inserting Malicious Macros for Persistence:**
     - This is a common technique used by threat actors to ensure that their malware remains on the victim's system even after a reboot. It aligns with the persistence tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Using a Backdoor to List Interesting Files:**
     - This technique is part of the discovery phase, where the attacker identifies valuable files and systems. It aligns with the discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Scanning All Drives, Including Network Shared Drives, for Sensitive Data:**
     - This is a logical next step after discovery. Once the attacker has identified interesting files, they would likely want to collect sensitive data from all available drives, including network shared drives, to maximize their data exfiltration efforts. This aligns with the data collection tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection. This is a common and logical progression in the attack lifecycle.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
