### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access.
     2. Using passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution.
     3. Establishing persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FIN13 is known to exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Passive Backdoors (BLUEAGAVE):**
     - BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports. This technique is used to maintain a low-profile presence and avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
   - **Persistence (SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries):**
     - After gaining initial access and establishing a backdoor, it is common for threat actors to establish persistence to ensure they can maintain long-term access to the compromised system. Tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries are used for this purpose.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     2. **Backdoor Establishment:** Using passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE to maintain a low-profile presence.
     3. **Persistence:** Establishing persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries to ensure long-term access.
   - This sequence aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors, including FIN13, who often use a combination of initial access, backdoors, and persistence mechanisms to achieve their objectives.
