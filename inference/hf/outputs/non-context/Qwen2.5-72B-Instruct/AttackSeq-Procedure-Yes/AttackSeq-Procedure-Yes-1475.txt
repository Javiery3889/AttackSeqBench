### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SLUB backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery:** Downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute.
     - **Exfiltration:** Creating archive files of the user's Desktop folders, building CAB files, and posting download links to a Slack channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The backdoor downloads a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parses it for commands to execute. This is a common technique used by malware to receive instructions from a command-and-control (C2) server.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The next step involves exfiltrating data. The question specifies that the data exfiltration involves:
       - Creating archive files of the user's Desktop folders.
       - Building CAB files.
       - Posting download links to a Slack channel.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that after the discovery phase, the attackers would move to the exfiltration phase. The described exfiltration method (creating archive files, building CAB files, and posting links to a Slack channel) is a detailed and specific method that aligns with the goals of data exfiltration.
     - The use of Slack for posting download links is also a plausible method for exfiltration, as it can be used to communicate with the attackers and provide a means to download the exfiltrated data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the detailed and specific nature of the exfiltration method described, and the logical progression from discovery to exfiltration, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
