### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
     - **Execution:** Running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** The question asks whether SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities is a common technique for gaining initial access to a target system. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - **Execution:** Running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor is a typical method for executing malware on a compromised system. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The question specifically asks about the communication method used by SparrowDoor for C2. Encrypted HTTPS is a common and effective method for C2 communication because it provides both encryption and a legitimate-looking traffic pattern, making it harder to detect and block.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Encrypted HTTPS for C2:**
     - Many modern malware and backdoors, including SparrowDoor, use encrypted HTTPS for C2 communication to avoid detection by network security tools.
     - HTTPS (port 443) is a widely used and trusted protocol, which makes it less likely to be blocked or inspected by network security measures.
     - Using HTTPS for C2 communication is a best practice for maintaining stealth and persistence in a compromised environment.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common use of encrypted HTTPS for C2 communication in modern malware, it is highly likely that SparrowDoor will use this method to communicate with the C&C server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
