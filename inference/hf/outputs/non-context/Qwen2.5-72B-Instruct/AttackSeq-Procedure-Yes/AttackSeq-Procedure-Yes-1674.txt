### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise.
     - Using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - **Initial Compromise with SocGholish:**
       - SocGholish is a known framework used for delivering malware via compromised legitimate websites. This technique is often used to gain an initial foothold in a target network.
     - **Remote System Discovery with Get-NetComputer:**
       - Once the initial compromise is achieved, attackers often need to discover other systems within the network to move laterally and achieve their objectives.
       - The Get-NetComputer command from PowerView is a common tool used in post-exploitation to discover networked systems and gather information about them.
     - **Plausibility:**
       - The sequence described is a common attack pattern. Attackers often use initial access techniques like SocGholish to gain a foothold and then use tools like PowerView for further reconnaissance and lateral movement.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - **Initial Compromise with SocGholish:**
       - While SocGholish is a valid initial access technique, this choice suggests that it is unlikely to be followed by the use of Get-NetComputer.
     - **Remote System Discovery with Get-NetComputer:**
       - This choice implies that the use of Get-NetComputer is not a typical next step after an initial compromise using SocGholish.
     - **Plausibility:**
       - This sequence is less likely because it does not follow a common attack pattern. After gaining initial access, attackers typically perform reconnaissance to understand the network environment, and Get-NetComputer is a common tool for this purpose.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is the one described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
