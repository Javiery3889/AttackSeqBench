### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence initiated by exploiting the Microsoft Office DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol to execute commands in memory.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attacker (Gallmaker) would use tools such as WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks before employing living off the land (LotL) tactics to evade detection and remove tools from victim machines.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exploit (DDE Protocol):**
     - The DDE protocol exploit is a known technique used to execute commands in memory, often used in phishing attacks to run malicious code.
   - **Scheduling PowerShell Scripts and Tasks (WindowsRoamingToolsTask):**
     - WindowsRoamingToolsTask is a tool that can be used to schedule tasks and scripts. This is a common tactic in post-exploitation to maintain persistence and automate malicious activities.
   - **Living Off the Land (LotL) Tactics:**
     - LotL tactics involve using legitimate system tools and processes to carry out malicious activities, which helps in evading detection and removing traces of the attack.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - After gaining initial access through the DDE protocol, it is logical for an attacker to establish persistence and automate their activities. Scheduling tasks and scripts using tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask fits this stage of the attack.
     - Once persistence is established, the attacker would likely use LotL tactics to avoid detection and clean up their tracks. This includes using native system tools to perform malicious actions and remove any evidence of their presence.
   - **Behavior of Gallmaker:**
     - Gallmaker is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection. The described sequence aligns with their known tactics.
