### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker has installed a backdoor on a victim's computer.
   - The backdoor exfiltrates data over a C&C (Command and Control) channel using encrypted communication.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will then shut down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP Analysis:**
     - **Backdoor Installation:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, allowing the attacker to maintain persistent access to the victim's system.
     - **Data Exfiltration:** Once the backdoor is installed, the attacker can use it to steal sensitive data and send it back to the C&C server. Encrypted communication is often used to avoid detection by network security tools.
     - **System Shutdown:** Shutting down the victim's computer would indeed disrupt operations and impact system availability. However, this is not a typical next step after data exfiltration.

   - **Operational Considerations:**
     - **Stealth and Persistence:** Attackers often aim to remain undetected and maintain long-term access to the victim's system. Shutting down the computer would likely alert the victim to the attack, which could lead to the discovery and removal of the backdoor.
     - **Data Exfiltration Continuity:** If the backdoor is designed for continuous data exfiltration, shutting down the computer would interrupt this process, which is counterproductive to the attacker's goals.
     - **Disruption as a Secondary Objective:** While disruption can be a goal in some attacks (e.g., ransomware), it is not typically the primary objective after data exfiltration. Disruption is more common in attacks where the primary goal is to cause damage or denial of service.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is not likely that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data. The primary goal of the attacker in this scenario is to maintain access and continue exfiltrating data, rather than to disrupt operations.

**Final Answer: B: No**
