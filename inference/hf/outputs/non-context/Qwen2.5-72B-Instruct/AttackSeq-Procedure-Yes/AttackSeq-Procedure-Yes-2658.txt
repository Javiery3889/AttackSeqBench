### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting metadata and content from mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.
     - Communicating with C&C (Command and Control) servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports.
     - Performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely for Korplug.
     - Korplug is known to be a malware that can perform data collection, communicate with C&C servers, and exfiltrate data.
     - The use of a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports and the compression and encryption of exfiltrated data are common techniques used by sophisticated malware to avoid detection and ensure data integrity.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely for Korplug.
     - If this were the case, it would imply that Korplug does not use these specific techniques, which would be less consistent with the known capabilities of sophisticated malware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with the known capabilities of sophisticated malware like Korplug.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Korplug is likely to follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
