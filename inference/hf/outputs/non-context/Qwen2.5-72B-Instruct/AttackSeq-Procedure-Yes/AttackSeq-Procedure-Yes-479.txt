### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Trickbot.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Stealing credentials and information from applications like Filezilla and internet browsers.
     - Connecting to a URL to download a payload.
     - Decoding the payload using `certutil.exe`.
     - Executing the payload during the Command and Control (C2) phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stealing Credentials and Information:**
     - Trickbot is known for its capability to steal credentials and information from various applications, including Filezilla and internet browsers. This is a common initial step in its attack lifecycle.
   - **Connecting to a URL to Download a Payload:**
     - After stealing credentials, Trickbot often connects to a URL to download additional payloads. This is a typical behavior for malware to maintain persistence and extend its capabilities.
   - **Decoding the Payload Using `certutil.exe`:**
     - `certutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility that can be abused by malware to decode and execute payloads. Trickbot has been known to use `certutil.exe` for this purpose.
   - **Executing the Payload During the C2 Phase:**
     - The Command and Control (C2) phase involves the malware communicating with a remote server to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Executing a downloaded payload is a common action during this phase to maintain control over the compromised system.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly plausible that Trickbot would follow this sequence of actions.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
