### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with a phishing email containing a ZIP file.
   - The ZIP file is delivered via a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department (SAT).
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The initial access is achieved through a phishing email with a ZIP file. This is a common method for delivering malware.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - After the user opens the ZIP file, it is likely that the malware will attempt to execute a script or payload. Using PowerShell to download and execute a script from the Internet is a common technique (T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter and T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer).
   - **Persistence Phase:**
     - Ensuring persistence is a critical step for maintaining long-term access to the compromised system. Common methods include creating startup folder shortcuts (T1060: Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription) and scheduled tasks (T1053: Scheduled Task/Job).

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns:
     1. **Initial Access:** Phishing email with a ZIP file.
     2. **Execution:** PowerShell script downloaded and executed from the Internet.
     3. **Persistence:** Ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common techniques used in such attacks, it is likely that the attack will proceed as described.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
