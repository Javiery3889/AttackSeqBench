### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the OceanLotus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by creating a Launch Agent.
     - Launching itself as a service from a new location.
     - Gathering system details.
     - Sending the information back to a command and control (C2) server using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Creating a Launch Agent and Launching as a Service):**
     - This is a common technique used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) to ensure that the malware remains active even after the system is restarted. OceanLotus, being a sophisticated APT group, is known to use such techniques.
   - **Gathering System Details:**
     - Once persistence is established, the next logical step for an APT is to gather information about the compromised system. This information can include details about the operating system, network configuration, and installed software, which can be used to further the attack.
   - **Sending Information to C2 Server:**
     - After gathering system details, the malware typically sends this information back to the C2 server. Using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys is a sophisticated method to ensure the communication is secure and difficult to intercept or analyze.
   - **Custom Binary Protocol with Session-Based Ephemeral Keys:**
     - This indicates a high level of sophistication in the communication mechanism, which is consistent with the capabilities of advanced APT groups like OceanLotus.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that OceanLotus would follow this sequence to achieve its objectives. The use of a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys aligns with the advanced nature of the group.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
