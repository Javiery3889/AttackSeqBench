### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has executed a command to gather system information and process lists using `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication for its command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - HTTPS is a common protocol used for C2 communications because it provides encryption, making it harder for network defenders to detect and analyze the traffic.
     - Malware often uses HTTPS to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection by network security tools.
     - Given that the malware has already gathered system information and process lists, it is plausible that the next step would be to establish a secure communication channel with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use HTTPS for C2 operations.
     - While it is possible that some malware might use other protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, ICMP), HTTPS is a widely used and effective method for C2 communications.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of HTTPS for C2 operations is a common and effective technique in malware operations.
   - Given the malware's initial reconnaissance activities (gathering system information and process lists), it is logical to assume that the next step would be to establish a secure communication channel with the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes the use of HTTPS for C2 communications.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
