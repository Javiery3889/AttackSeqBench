### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where malware has discovered system information such as the hostname, user details, and active TCP connections.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if the malware is likely to communicate with C&C (Command and Control) servers at specific IP addresses using application layer protocols.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely the malware will communicate with the C&C servers using application layer protocols.
     - Application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP) are commonly used by malware to communicate with C&C servers because they are often allowed through firewalls and are less likely to be blocked by network security measures.
     - After gathering system information, it is a logical next step for malware to establish communication with its C&C servers to report back the collected data and receive further instructions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely the malware will communicate with the C&C servers using application layer protocols.
     - This is less plausible because malware typically needs to communicate with C&C servers to function effectively, and application layer protocols are a common and effective means of doing so.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will communicate with the C&C servers using application layer protocols after gathering system information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
