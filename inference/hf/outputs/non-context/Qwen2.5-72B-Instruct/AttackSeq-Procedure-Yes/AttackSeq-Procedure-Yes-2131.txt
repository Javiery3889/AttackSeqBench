### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Konni APT Group.
   - The sequence involves the execution of obfuscated scripts: 'update.vbs' and 'activate.vbs'.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the 'versioninfo.bat' script is used to discover information about the user's computer before exfiltrating the collected data using 'unactivate.vbs'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscated Scripts ('update.vbs' and 'activate.vbs'):**
     - These scripts are often used to execute malicious code while evading detection. They can be used to establish a foothold on the system, download additional payloads, or perform other initial actions.
   - **'versioninfo.bat' Script:**
     - This script is likely used to gather system information, such as the operating system version, installed software, and other details that can help the attacker understand the environment they are operating in.
   - **Exfiltration ('unactivate.vbs'):**
     - This script is used to send the collected data back to the attacker's server.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Compromise:**
     - The execution of 'update.vbs' and 'activate.vbs' suggests that the initial compromise has been successful, and the attacker has gained access to the system.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - It is common for attackers to gather information about the compromised system before proceeding with further actions. This helps them understand the environment and plan their next steps.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - After gathering the necessary information, the attacker would typically exfiltrate the data to their command and control (C2) server.

   Given this sequence, it is logical that the 'versioninfo.bat' script would be used to gather system information before the data is exfiltrated using 'unactivate.vbs'.
