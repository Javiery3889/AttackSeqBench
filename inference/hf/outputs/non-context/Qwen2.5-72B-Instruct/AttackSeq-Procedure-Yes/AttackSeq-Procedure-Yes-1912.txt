### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial attack vector: spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - It then asks if APT10 is likely to conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network before leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 is known to use spear phishing as an initial access vector. This is a common tactic for many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** After gaining initial access, it is highly likely that APT10 would conduct internal reconnaissance to understand the network topology, identify key systems, and gather information about the environment. This is a crucial step in any targeted attack to plan further actions.
   - **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure:** APT10 has been known to target MSPs and leverage their infrastructure to move laterally between different victim networks. This is a sophisticated technique that requires a detailed understanding of the network and the MSP's infrastructure.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with the known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of APT10.
   - Conducting internal reconnaissance before leveraging shared MSP infrastructure is a logical and strategic step in the attack lifecycle.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
