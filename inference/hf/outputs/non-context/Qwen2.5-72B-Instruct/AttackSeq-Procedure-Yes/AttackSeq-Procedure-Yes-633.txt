### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving privilege escalation using a Metasploit module, followed by a potential C&C (Command and Control) communication and domain resolution.
   - The specific TTPs mentioned are:
     - Privilege escalation using the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll`.
     - Contacting a C&C server at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ`.
     - Resolving the domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` is known for privilege escalation. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain higher-level permissions on a compromised system.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - After gaining higher privileges, it is common for malware to establish a C&C communication to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.
     - The URL `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ` is a specific endpoint that the shellcode might contact.
   - **Domain Resolution:**
     - Resolving a domain to an IP address is a standard network operation. In this context, resolving `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` to `209.239.115[.]91` could be part of the C&C communication process, where the domain is used to mask the true IP address of the C&C server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The use of `ext_server_priv.x86.dll` for privilege escalation is a plausible and common step in an attack sequence.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - After privilege escalation, the next logical step is to establish a C&C communication. The URL `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ` is a specific endpoint that the shellcode might use to communicate with the C&C server.
   - **Domain Resolution:**
     - Resolving the domain `psychology-blog.ezua[.]com` to the IP address `209.239.115[.]91` is a plausible step to ensure that the C&C communication is directed to the correct server. This is a common technique to obfuscate the true IP address of the C&C server.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of TTPs and the common practices in cyber attacks, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
