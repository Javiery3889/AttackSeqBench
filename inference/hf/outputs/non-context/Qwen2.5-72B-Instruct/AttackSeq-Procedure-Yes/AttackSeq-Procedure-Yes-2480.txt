### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spear phishing emails containing malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control (C2) servers during the resource development phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did acquire infrastructure such as domains for C2 servers.
     - In a typical attack sequence, after gaining initial access (e.g., through spear phishing), attackers often set up C2 infrastructure to maintain control over the compromised systems and to exfiltrate data or execute further commands.
     - Acquiring domains for C2 servers is a common practice in the resource development phase to ensure that the attackers have a reliable and stealthy way to communicate with the compromised systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not acquire infrastructure such as domains for C2 servers.
     - This is less likely because without C2 infrastructure, the attackers would have limited control over the compromised systems and would find it difficult to maintain persistence or execute further stages of the attack.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical attack sequence and the importance of C2 infrastructure in maintaining control over compromised systems, the most plausible answer is that the attackers did acquire infrastructure such as domains for C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
