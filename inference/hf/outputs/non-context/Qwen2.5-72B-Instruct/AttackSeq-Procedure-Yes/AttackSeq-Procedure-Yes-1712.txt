### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Mustang Panda (also known as APT35, Charming Kitten, etc.).
   - The initial TTP is the use of a double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) in a spearphishing campaign to evade defenses.
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda is likely to use documents that attempt to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses as part of their communication strategy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Double Extension Trick (sample.doc.lnk):**
     - This is a common technique used in spearphishing to trick users into opening malicious files. The `.lnk` extension is often hidden, making the file appear as a benign document (e.g., `.doc`).
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Once a user opens the malicious file, it is common for the malware to establish a connection to a C2 server to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or maintain persistence.
   - **Mustang Panda's TTPs:**
     - Mustang Panda is known for using sophisticated spearphishing campaigns and has been observed using various techniques to establish and maintain C2 communication.
     - They often use documents that, when opened, execute malicious code that attempts to connect to C2 infrastructure.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that Mustang Panda is known for using spearphishing and double extension tricks to deliver malware, and that their malware typically includes C2 communication, it is highly likely that they would use documents that attempt to connect to C2 domains and IP addresses.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
