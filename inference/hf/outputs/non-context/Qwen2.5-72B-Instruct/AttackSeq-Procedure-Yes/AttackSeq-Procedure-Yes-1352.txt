### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with a spear-phishing attack that exploits an Adobe Flash vulnerability.
   - The exploit is delivered through links to `show.swf` files on the domains `rpt.perrydale[.]com` and `report.perrydale[.]com`.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Flash exploit `show.swf` will execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes before attempting to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image `b.gif`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing and Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails with malicious links or attachments.
     - The links in this case point to `show.swf` files, which are Flash files.
   - **Exploiting Adobe Flash:**
     - Adobe Flash has been a frequent target for exploits due to its widespread use and numerous vulnerabilities.
     - Flash files can contain ActionScript, which can be used to execute malicious code.
   - **Executing Shellcode:**
     - Once the Flash exploit is triggered, it can execute shellcode, which is a small piece of code used to start a shell in the context of an exploited program.
     - Shellcode is often used to gain initial control over the target system.
   - **Evasion with Payload in Animated GIF:**
     - After gaining initial access, attackers often attempt to evade detection.
     - Embedding a payload in an animated GIF image is a known technique to bypass security measures, as GIF files are typically considered benign.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns:
     - **Initial Access:** The spear-phishing attack delivers the Flash exploit.
     - **Exploitation:** The Flash file `show.swf` uses embedded ActionScript to execute shellcode.
     - **Evasion:** The payload is embedded in an animated GIF image `b.gif` to avoid detection.
