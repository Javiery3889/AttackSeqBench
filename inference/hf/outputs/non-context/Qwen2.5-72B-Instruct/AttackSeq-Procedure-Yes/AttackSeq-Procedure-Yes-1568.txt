### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Turla group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Implementing file upload and download capabilities with an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) backdoor.
     - **Collection Phase:** Using backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Turla is known for using sophisticated backdoors and RPC mechanisms to establish a foothold in the target network.
     - Implementing file upload and download capabilities is a common tactic during the discovery phase to facilitate further operations.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Once the backdoor is established, Turla would likely use it to collect various types of data.
     - Collecting recent files and files from USB drives is a logical next step in the collection phase, as these files often contain valuable information.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice aligns with the known TTPs of Turla. After establishing the backdoor and file transfer capabilities, it is highly likely that Turla would use these capabilities to collect recent files and files from USB drives.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice does not align with the known TTPs of Turla. Given the sophistication and thoroughness of Turla's operations, it is unlikely that they would not use the backdoor to collect valuable data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
