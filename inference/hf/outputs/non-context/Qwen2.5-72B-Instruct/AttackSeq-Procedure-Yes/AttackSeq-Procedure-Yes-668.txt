### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CopyKittens group.
   - The sequence involves the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) component of Matryoshka ensuring persistence by creating a registry key for automatic execution upon system boot.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the CopyKittens group will use a global mutex to reduce the risk of multiple RAT instances running simultaneously.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Registry Key:**
     - Creating a registry key for automatic execution upon system boot is a common persistence technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts.
   - **Global Mutex:**
     - A global mutex is a synchronization object that can be used to ensure that only one instance of a program runs at a time. This is a common technique used by malware to avoid conflicts and reduce the risk of detection.
   - **CopyKittens Group:**
     - CopyKittens is a known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group that has been observed using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
     - Given their level of sophistication, it is reasonable to assume that they would use techniques to ensure their malware runs efficiently and avoids conflicts.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of a global mutex to prevent multiple instances of the RAT from running simultaneously is a logical and common practice in malware development.
   - Given the sophistication of the CopyKittens group, it is highly likely that they would employ such a technique to ensure the stability and reliability of their malware.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
