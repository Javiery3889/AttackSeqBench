### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Rising Sun implant.
   - The implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - It communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the implant would continue to use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration.
     - Given that the implant has already used RC4 and Base64 for communication with the control server, it is plausible that it would use the same methods for data exfiltration to maintain consistency and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the implant would not use RC4 and Base64 for data exfiltration.
     - This is less likely because changing the encryption and obfuscation methods would introduce additional complexity and risk of detection. Consistency in communication methods is a common practice in malware to avoid raising suspicion.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the implant would continue to use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
