### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM actors:
     - Development of a custom toolset.
     - Registration of domains with or without WHOIS protection.
     - Gathering of victim identity information.
     - Gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that ProjectM actors did gather victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts.
     - Gathering victim identity information is a common and crucial step in reconnaissance. It helps attackers tailor their spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks to be more convincing and effective.
     - Custom toolsets and domain registration are often used to support these reconnaissance activities by providing the necessary infrastructure and tools to gather and use the victim information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ProjectM actors did not gather victim identity information.
     - This is less likely because without victim identity information, the spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks would be less targeted and less effective. Reconnaissance is a fundamental step in many cyber attack sequences.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common practices in cyber attacks and the logical sequence of actions described, it is more plausible that ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
