### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Agrius.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Exploiting public-facing applications (e.g., CVE-2018-13379) to gain initial access.
     2. Using webshells for tunneling RDP traffic.
     3. Leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement.
     4. Communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via CVE-2018-13379:**
     - CVE-2018-13379 is a known vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy products, which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. This is a plausible first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Using Webshells for Tunneling RDP Traffic:**
     - Webshells are commonly used by attackers to maintain persistence and execute commands on compromised servers. Tunneling RDP traffic through a webshell is a known technique to bypass network restrictions and gain remote access.
   - **Leveraging Compromised Accounts for Lateral Movement:**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often use compromised credentials to move laterally within the network, gaining access to additional systems and resources.
   - **Communicating with C2 Servers using the 'IPsec Helper' Backdoor over HTTP:**
     - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a specific tool that can be used to communicate with C2 servers. Using HTTP for C2 communication is common as it can blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379) to gain a foothold in the network.
     2. **Persistence and Command Execution:** Using webshells to maintain access and tunnel RDP traffic.
     3. **Lateral Movement:** Leveraging compromised accounts to move deeper into the network.
     4. **C2 Communication:** Using a specific backdoor ('IPsec Helper') to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP.

   - Each step in the sequence is consistent with known TTPs and the capabilities of sophisticated threat actors.
