### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with the Execution tactic where a macro in FlowCloud renames files and executes `gup.exe` using a version of `certutil.exe` (renamed to `Temptcm.tmp`).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that `gup.exe` will execute `EhStorAuthn.exe` to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution of `gup.exe` using `certutil.exe`:**
     - `certutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility often abused by attackers to download and execute malicious payloads.
     - Renaming `certutil.exe` to `Temptcm.tmp` is a common technique to evade detection.
   - **Execution of `EhStorAuthn.exe`:**
     - `EhStorAuthn.exe` is a legitimate Windows executable related to storage authentication.
     - Attackers sometimes use legitimate binaries to perform malicious actions, a technique known as "living off the land" (LoL).
   - **Persistence:**
     - Extracting and installing payload file components for persistence is a common goal in malware attacks to ensure the malware remains active even after system reboots.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - The use of `certutil.exe` to execute `gup.exe` is a known technique for initial execution.
     - The subsequent execution of `EhStorAuthn.exe` to extract and install payload components aligns with the goal of achieving persistence.
     - The use of legitimate binaries like `EhStorAuthn.exe` to perform malicious actions is a common tactic to avoid detection.
