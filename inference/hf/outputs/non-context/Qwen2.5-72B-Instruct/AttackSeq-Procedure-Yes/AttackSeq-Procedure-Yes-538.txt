### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the PIVY variant.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Executing `rundll32.exe` as `ActiveFlash.exe`.
     - Using DLL sideloading to load a dropped DLL for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the PIVY variant will first execute `rundll32.exe` as `ActiveFlash.exe` and then use DLL sideloading to load the dropped DLL.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the PIVY variant will not execute `rundll32.exe` as `ActiveFlash.exe` before using DLL sideloading.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Execution of `rundll32.exe` as `ActiveFlash.exe`:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to masquerade as legitimate processes. By renaming `rundll32.exe` to `ActiveFlash.exe`, the malware can avoid detection by security software and users who might recognize `rundll32.exe` as a legitimate system file.
   - **DLL Sideloading:**
     - DLL sideloading is a technique where a malicious DLL is loaded by a legitimate application. This is often used for defense evasion because the legitimate application is trusted by the system and security software.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - It is plausible that the PIVY variant would first execute `rundll32.exe` as `ActiveFlash.exe` to establish a foothold and then use DLL sideloading to load the dropped DLL. This sequence allows the malware to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
