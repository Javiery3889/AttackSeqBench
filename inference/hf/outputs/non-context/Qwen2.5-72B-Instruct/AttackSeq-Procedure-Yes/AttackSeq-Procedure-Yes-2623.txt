### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group known as Machete.
   - The sequence in question involves:
     - Executing a downloader.
     - Opening a decoy PDF or Microsoft Office document.
     - Installing backdoor components.
     - Creating Windows Task Scheduler tasks for maintaining persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Machete Group TTPs:**
     - Machete is known for using sophisticated and multi-stage attack techniques.
     - They often use social engineering to deliver initial payloads, such as decoy documents.
     - They have been observed using downloaders to fetch additional malware components.
     - Persistence mechanisms, such as Windows Task Scheduler tasks, are common in their operations to ensure long-term access to compromised systems.

   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - **Executing a Downloader:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where a small, initial payload is used to download additional malware.
     - **Opening a Decoy Document:** This is a typical social engineering tactic to trick the user into executing the malware. Machete has been known to use decoy documents to lure victims.
     - **Installing Backdoor Components:** Once the initial payload is executed, the next step is often to install backdoor components to gain remote access to the system.
     - **Creating Windows Task Scheduler Tasks:** This is a common persistence technique to ensure that the backdoor remains active even after the system is restarted.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known TTPs of the Machete group and the logical sequence of the described actions, it is highly likely that Machete would execute such a sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
