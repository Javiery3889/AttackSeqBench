### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of a VBScript engine vulnerability to gain initial access through a watering hole attack.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the attackers would impair defenses by making the first stage downloader exit if antivirus software processes are detected before downloading and executing a backdoor for further operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Watering Hole Attack:**
     - A watering hole attack involves compromising a website that the target frequently visits to deliver a payload, often exploiting a vulnerability in a browser or a scripting engine.
   - **Exploiting VBScript Engine Vulnerability:**
     - This is a common technique to gain initial access by executing malicious code on the victim's machine.
   - **Impairing Defenses:**
     - Impairing defenses is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, often involving techniques to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **First Stage Downloader:**
     - A first stage downloader is typically a small piece of malware designed to download and execute additional payloads.
   - **Checking for Antivirus Software:**
     - It is a common practice for malware to check for the presence of antivirus software to avoid detection and ensure successful execution.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - After gaining initial access through the watering hole attack and exploiting the VBScript engine vulnerability, the attackers would likely want to ensure that their operations are not detected by security software.
     - Checking for antivirus software and exiting if it is detected is a common technique to avoid detection and ensure that the backdoor can be downloaded and executed successfully.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - This sequence of actions is highly plausible because it aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated attackers who aim to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
