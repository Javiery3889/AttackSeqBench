### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, etc.).
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access.
     2. Execution of exploit documents to exploit vulnerabilities.
     3. Installation of malware, specifically GAMEFISH.
     4. Use of tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE during operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-phishing Campaigns:**
     - APT28 is known for using spear-phishing to gain initial access to target networks. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Execution of Exploit Documents:**
     - Once the spear-phishing emails are opened, the exploit documents are typically executed to exploit vulnerabilities on the victim's system. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Installation of Malware (GAMEFISH):**
     - After exploiting vulnerabilities, APT28 often installs malware like GAMEFISH to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
   - **Use of Tools (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, SOURFACE):**
     - These tools are known to be used by APT28 for various purposes such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, and maintaining persistence. Using these tools after gaining initial access and installing malware is consistent with their operational tactics.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of APT28. Each step logically follows the previous one, making it a plausible and likely sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
