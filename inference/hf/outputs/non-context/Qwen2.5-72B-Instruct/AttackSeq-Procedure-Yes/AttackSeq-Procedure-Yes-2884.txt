### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence starts with registry queries using functions like `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` for system information collection.
   - The next step involves using `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` to discover process and thread information.
   - The final step is command and control (C2) activities using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Queries (`GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue`):**
     - These functions are typically used to read values from the Windows registry, which can provide valuable system information such as installed software, user accounts, and system configurations.
   - **Process and Thread Information (`ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread`):**
     - These functions are used to get and set the context of a thread, which can be useful for understanding the state of processes and threads running on the system. This information can be used for various purposes, such as process injection, thread manipulation, or identifying specific processes to target.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Activities:**
     - C2 activities involve communication between the compromised system and the attacker's server, often using protocols like HTTP and HTTPS to send and receive commands and data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible because it follows a logical progression of an attack:
       1. **Initial Reconnaissance:** The attacker uses registry queries to gather system information, which helps in understanding the environment and identifying potential targets.
       2. **Process and Thread Discovery:** After gathering system information, the attacker uses `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` to gain deeper insights into running processes and threads. This information can be crucial for further actions, such as injecting code into specific processes or manipulating threads.
       3. **Command and Control (C2):** Once the attacker has a good understanding of the system and has potentially gained control over specific processes, they can establish C2 communication to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns. Therefore, it is likely that operators would use `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` to discover process and thread information before proceeding to C2 activities using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
