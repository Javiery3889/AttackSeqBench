### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Credential Access:** Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     - **Discovery:** Collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.
     - **Exfiltration:** Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow is likely to collect system information during the Discovery phase before exfiltrating data.
     - This aligns with the typical attack sequence where an attacker first gains access to credentials, then explores the system to gather more information, and finally exfiltrates sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow is not likely to collect system information during the Discovery phase.
     - This is less plausible because collecting system information is a common step in the attack lifecycle to understand the environment and identify valuable data to exfiltrate.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical attack sequence and the logical progression of TTPs, it is more plausible that FamousSparrow would collect system information during the Discovery phase before exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
