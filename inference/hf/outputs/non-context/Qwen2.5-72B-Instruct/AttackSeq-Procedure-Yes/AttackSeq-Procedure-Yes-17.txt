### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the "Machete" malware.
   - The malware establishes persistence by creating a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installing itself in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will subsequently log keystrokes, capture audio from the computer's microphone, and hijack the clipboard to collect information from the target machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - The malware creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs itself in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. This is a common technique to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts or the user logs in.
   - **Information Collection:**
     - Logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and hijacking the clipboard are all techniques used to collect sensitive information from the target machine.
     - These actions are typical for malware that aims to gather data for exfiltration or further exploitation.

3. **Evaluate the Likelihood:**
   - Given that the malware has already established persistence, it is highly likely that it will proceed to collect information from the target machine.
   - The described actions (logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and hijacking the clipboard) are common post-persistence activities for malware, especially for those designed to steal sensitive information.
