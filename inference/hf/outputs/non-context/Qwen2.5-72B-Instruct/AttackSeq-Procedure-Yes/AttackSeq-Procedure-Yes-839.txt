### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the malware WinDealer.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Executing by reading its configuration file from `C:\ProgramData`.
     2. Loading a DLL module into memory.
     3. Discovering data from SNS (Social Networking Service) applications.
     4. Categorizing the collected data into different directories as `.a` files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that WinDealer discovers data from SNS applications before categorizing the collected data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that WinDealer does not discover data from SNS applications before categorizing the collected data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Execution and Configuration:**
     - WinDealer starts by reading its configuration file from `C:\ProgramData`. This is a common initial step for malware to load its settings and determine its next actions.
   - **Loading DLL:**
     - After reading the configuration, WinDealer loads a DLL module into memory. This is often done to extend its functionality or to perform specific tasks.
   - **Data Discovery:**
     - The next logical step would be to discover data from SNS applications. This is a common tactic for malware to gather sensitive information.
   - **Data Categorization:**
     - Once the data is discovered, it is then categorized and stored in different directories as `.a` files. This is a typical post-discovery action to organize the collected data for exfiltration or further processing.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common pattern for malware operations. WinDealer would likely discover data from SNS applications before categorizing the collected data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
