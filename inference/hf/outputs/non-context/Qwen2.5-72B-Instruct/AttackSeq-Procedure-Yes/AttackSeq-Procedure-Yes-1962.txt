### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the StellarParticle campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Credential Hopping:** This involves using compromised credentials to move laterally within a network.
     - **Configuring Malware (TrailBlazer) for WMI Persistence:** This involves setting up malware to maintain persistence using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
     - **Stealing Web Session Cookies:** This involves extracting session cookies from web browsers on end-user workstations.
     - **Using Web Session Cookies for Credential Access:** This involves using the stolen session cookies to gain access to cloud resources.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Hopping and WMI Persistence:**
     - These are common techniques used in the initial stages of an attack to gain and maintain access to a network.
   - **Stealing Web Session Cookies:**
     - This is a technique often used to gain access to web applications and cloud resources without needing to re-authenticate.
   - **Using Web Session Cookies for Credential Access:**
     - This is a logical next step after stealing web session cookies, as it allows the attacker to bypass traditional authentication mechanisms.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - After gaining initial access and setting up persistence, an attacker would likely look for additional ways to maintain and expand their access.
     - Stealing web session cookies is a common technique for accessing cloud resources, which is a valuable target for many campaigns.
     - Using the stolen cookies to access cloud resources is a logical follow-up to the initial compromise and persistence setup.

### Final Answer:
