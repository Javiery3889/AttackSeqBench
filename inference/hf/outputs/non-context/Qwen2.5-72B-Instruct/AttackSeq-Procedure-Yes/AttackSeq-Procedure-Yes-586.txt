### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by adversaries.
   - The sequence starts with the use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON during the **Reconnaissance** phase to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that adversaries would identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address during the **Resource Development** phase to support the infrastructure linked with attacks like the Kinsing malware campaign.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - DOCKERGEDDON is a tool used to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities in Docker APIs. This tool helps adversaries identify potential targets by scanning netblocks and detecting exposed Docker APIs.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - In the Resource Development phase, adversaries typically build and prepare the infrastructure they will use to carry out their attacks. This can include setting up command and control (C2) servers, registering domains, and configuring other necessary resources.
   - **Kinsing Malware Campaign:**
     - Kinsing is a known malware campaign that targets Docker environments. Adversaries often use compromised Docker APIs to deploy and spread this malware.
   - **Identifying and Using Domains Resolving to the Same IP Address:**
     - It is common for adversaries to use multiple domains that resolve to the same IP address to create a robust and resilient infrastructure. This can help them maintain access to their C2 servers and other resources even if some domains are taken down.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the adversaries have already identified compromised Docker APIs during the Reconnaissance phase, it is highly likely that they would use this information to set up their infrastructure in the Resource Development phase.
   - Using domains that resolve to the same IP address is a common tactic to ensure the resilience of their infrastructure, which is crucial for maintaining control over the compromised systems and deploying malware like Kinsing.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
