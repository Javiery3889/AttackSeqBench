### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT-TOCS.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Defense Evasion:** Running in memory and multi-beacon communication.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicating via HTTP GET requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - **Running in memory:** This technique is used to avoid detection by traditional disk-based security tools. It is a common method for evading defenses.
     - **Multi-beacon communication:** This involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and evade detection. It is also a common technique in advanced persistent threats (APTs).
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - **PowerShell:** PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and shell that is often used by attackers for various purposes, including downloading and executing malicious scripts.
     - **Encrypted data scripts:** Using encryption for data scripts can help evade detection by network monitoring tools.
     - **HTTP GET requests:** HTTP is a common protocol used for C2 communications because it blends in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. APT-TOCS, being an advanced threat actor, would likely use a combination of sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain control over compromised systems.
   - Running in memory and multi-beacon communication are effective for defense evasion.
   - Using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicating via HTTP GET requests is a common and effective method for C2 communications.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
