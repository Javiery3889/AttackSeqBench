### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malicious document will contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware in a multi-stage command and control operation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DDE Technique:**
     - DDE is a technique used to execute commands or scripts by embedding them in a Microsoft Office document. This is often used to invoke PowerShell or other command-line tools.
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - Once DDE is used to invoke PowerShell, the encoded commands can be executed, which may include downloading or executing additional malware.
   - **Control Server Contact:**
     - In a multi-stage attack, it is common for the initial payload (e.g., the commands executed by PowerShell) to contact a control server to download additional stages of the malware.
   - **Seduploader Malware:**
     - Seduploader is a known first-stage malware that is often used in multi-stage attacks to establish a foothold and download additional payloads.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the DDE technique is used to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands, it is highly likely that the next step in the attack sequence would involve contacting a control server to download the first-stage Seduploader malware.
   - This is a common pattern in multi-stage attacks where the initial payload is used to establish communication with a control server to download and execute additional stages of the malware.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
