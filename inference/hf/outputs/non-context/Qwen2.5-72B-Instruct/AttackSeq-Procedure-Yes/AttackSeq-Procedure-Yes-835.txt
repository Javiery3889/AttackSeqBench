### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by WinDealer.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Steal information from SNS (Social Networking Service) applications.
     2. Encrypt the stolen data using AES.
     3. Communicate with C2 (Command and Control) servers using non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stealing Information from SNS Applications:**
     - This is a common TTP for many malware families, including WinDealer. Malware often targets sensitive information from social networking applications to gather personal data, credentials, and other valuable information.
   - **Encrypting Stolen Data Using AES:**
     - Encrypting stolen data is a common practice to ensure that the data remains confidential during transmission. AES is a widely used and secure encryption algorithm, making it a plausible choice for this purpose.
   - **Communicating with C2 Servers Using Non-Standard Ports:**
     - Using non-standard ports for C2 communication is a common technique to evade detection by network security systems. Ports 6999 (UDP) and 55556 (TCP) are not standard ports and are less likely to be monitored, making them suitable for stealthy communication.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Each step in the sequence is a plausible and common TTP for malware, including WinDealer.
   - The combination of these TTPs (stealing information, encrypting data, and using non-standard ports for C2 communication) is consistent with the behavior of sophisticated malware.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
