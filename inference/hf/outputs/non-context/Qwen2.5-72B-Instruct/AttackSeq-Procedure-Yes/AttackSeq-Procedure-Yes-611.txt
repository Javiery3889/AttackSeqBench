### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance tools (Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3) to enumerate services and authenticate via brute force.
   - The next step involves using Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package for identifying internal hosts and remotely controlling software.
   - Finally, the question asks if it is likely that attackers will use AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat to evade defenses.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, and Fast SYN Scanner are commonly used for reconnaissance to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
     - RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 can be used to authenticate and gain access to VNC services, often through brute force attacks.
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - Advanced IP Scanner is used to identify internal hosts on a network.
     - Radmin and PushVNC are remote control tools that can be used to gain and maintain access to compromised systems.
   - **Defense Evasion Phase:**
     - AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat are batch files that can be used to automate tasks, such as modifying system configurations or running malicious scripts, to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of an attack:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Enumerate services and authenticate via brute force.
     2. **Initial Access:** Identify internal hosts and gain remote control.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** Use batch files to evade defenses and maintain persistence.
   - Each step in the sequence builds upon the previous one, making it a plausible and common attack pattern.
