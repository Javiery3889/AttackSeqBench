### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Charming Kitten, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Phishing attacks to trick victims into providing credentials.
     2. Impersonating services like Google Drive and Yahoo.
     3. Using self-signed digital certificates to subvert trust controls.
     4. Redirecting victims to legitimate services for evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing and Credential Harvesting:**
     - Charming Kitten is known for using sophisticated phishing techniques to trick victims into providing their credentials. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Impersonating Services:**
     - Impersonating well-known services like Google Drive and Yahoo is a common tactic to make the phishing pages appear legitimate and increase the likelihood of success.
   - **Using Self-Signed Digital Certificates:**
     - Self-signed digital certificates can be used to create a false sense of security. However, they are not typically used to subvert trust controls in the context of phishing attacks. Instead, attackers often use valid certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to avoid raising suspicion.
   - **Redirecting to Legitimate Services:**
     - Redirecting victims to legitimate services after harvesting credentials is a common technique to maintain the appearance of normalcy and avoid immediate detection.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the first three steps (phishing, impersonating services, and redirecting to legitimate services) are plausible and align with known TTPs of Charming Kitten, the use of self-signed digital certificates to subvert trust controls is less likely in this context.
   - Attackers typically use valid certificates to avoid detection and maintain the appearance of legitimacy.

### Final Answer:
B: No
