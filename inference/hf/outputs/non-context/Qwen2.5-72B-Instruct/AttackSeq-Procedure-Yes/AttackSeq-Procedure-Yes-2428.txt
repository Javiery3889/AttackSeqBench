### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving defense evasion, process injection, and command and control (C2) operations.
   - The specific TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Defense Evasion:** Disguising the payload as a resource within a custom loader.
     - **Process Injection:** Injecting the payload into the target process.
     - **Process Discovery:** Targeting the 'fwmain32.exe' process.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Reading commands from a file in the 'c:\intel' folder.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion and Process Injection:**
     - These are common techniques used by malware to avoid detection and gain execution within a target process. This part of the sequence is plausible.
   - **Process Discovery:**
     - The question asks if ATMitch is likely to target the 'fwmain32.exe' process for process discovery. However, 'fwmain32.exe' is not a commonly known process that malware typically targets for process discovery. It is more likely that malware would target more common or critical processes.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Reading commands from a file in a specific directory (e.g., 'c:\intel') is a common C2 technique. This part of the sequence is plausible.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion and Process Injection:**
     - These steps are consistent with the behavior of many malware families, including ATMitch.
   - **Process Discovery:**
     - The specific targeting of 'fwmain32.exe' for process discovery is less likely. Malware typically targets more common processes or processes that are more relevant to its objectives.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Reading commands from a file in a specific directory is a common C2 technique and fits well with the behavior of ATMitch.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include targeting the 'fwmain32.exe' process for process discovery. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
