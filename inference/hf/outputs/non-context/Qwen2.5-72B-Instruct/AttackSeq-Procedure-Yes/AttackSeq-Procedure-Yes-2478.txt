### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by adversaries.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gaining persistence through creating a local account.
     - Hijacking references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries used Empire stagers for encrypted communication in the command-and-control stage.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Creating a Local Account:**
     - This is a common technique for gaining persistence. By creating a local account, adversaries ensure they have a way to maintain access to the system even if other access points are closed.
   - **Hijacking References to COM Objects:**
     - This technique involves modifying the registry or other system configurations to ensure that when a legitimate application attempts to use a COM object, it instead loads a malicious component. This can be used for persistence and to maintain control over the system.
   - **Empire Stagers:**
     - Empire is a post-exploitation framework that includes stagers, which are small pieces of code used to establish a connection back to the command-and-control (C2) server. These stagers often use encrypted communication to avoid detection.
   - **Command-and-Control (C2) Stage:**
     - After gaining initial access and persistence, adversaries typically establish a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised system and exfiltrate data or execute further commands.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the adversaries have already gained persistence and control over the system, it is logical that they would use a tool like Empire to establish a secure and encrypted C2 channel.
   - Empire stagers are known for their ability to establish encrypted communication, which aligns well with the need for secure C2 in the later stages of an attack.
   - The use of Empire stagers is a common practice in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios, especially after gaining persistence and control over the system.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
