### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Credential Access:** Using Procdump and Mimikatz to extract credentials.
     - **Pass-the-Hash:** Employing 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - The question then asks if the campaign is likely to use tools like STSRCheck and PORT.EXE for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Procdump and Mimikatz:**
     - Procdump is a tool used to capture memory dumps of processes, which can be useful for extracting credentials.
     - Mimikatz is a well-known tool for extracting credentials from memory, including NTLM hashes.
   - **Pass-the-Hash:**
     - 'Invoke the Hash' is a technique used to perform pass-the-hash attacks, where the attacker uses the extracted NTLM hash to authenticate to other systems.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is the process of moving from one system to another within a network to gain further access and control.
     - Tools like STSRCheck and PORT.EXE are not commonly associated with lateral movement in the context of the Fox Kitten Campaign.
     - **STSRCheck** is a tool used to check for the presence of specific security software, which is more related to reconnaissance and initial access.
     - **PORT.EXE** is a tool used to open ports, which can be useful for setting up communication channels but is not typically used for lateral movement.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Fox Kitten Campaign is known for using sophisticated techniques for credential access and lateral movement.
   - The use of Procdump and Mimikatz for credential extraction and 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks are well-documented TTPs in the campaign.
   - However, the tools STSRCheck and PORT.EXE are not typically associated with the lateral movement phase of the attack.
   - Lateral movement in such campaigns is more likely to involve techniques like PsExec, WMI, or SMB for moving between systems using the extracted credentials.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
