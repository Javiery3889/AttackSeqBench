### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware Powersing.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Capturing periodic screenshots.
     - Executing arbitrary PowerShell scripts provided by the C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Powersing will leverage public services and use dead drop resolvers for storing data and blending communication into legitimate traffic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Leveraging Public Services:**
     - Malware often uses public services to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection. This can include using popular websites, social media platforms, or cloud storage services.
   - **Using Dead Drop Resolvers:**
     - Dead drop resolvers are a technique where malware uses a predefined set of locations (e.g., web pages, images, or other online resources) to store and retrieve data. This can help the malware communicate with its C&C server without direct, easily detectable connections.
   - **Combining Both Techniques:**
     - Using public services and dead drop resolvers together can make it more difficult for defenders to detect and block the malware's communication. This is a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs) to maintain a low profile and persist in the network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Powersing, which already captures screenshots and executes arbitrary scripts, it is plausible that it would use additional techniques to blend in and avoid detection. Leveraging public services and using dead drop resolvers aligns with the advanced capabilities of such malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
