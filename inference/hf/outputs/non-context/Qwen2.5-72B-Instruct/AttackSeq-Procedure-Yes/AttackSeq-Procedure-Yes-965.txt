### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Naikon APT group.
   - The sequence involves the Aria-body backdoor collecting detailed information from the victim's machine.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Naikon APT group will use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C (Command and Control) communication before executing additional commands received from the server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Aria-body Backdoor:**
     - Aria-body is a known backdoor used by the Naikon APT group.
     - It is designed to collect detailed information from the victim's machine, which is a common initial step in many APT campaigns.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - HTTP and TCP are common protocols used for C&C communication in many APT campaigns.
     - Naikon APT group is known to use these protocols for communication between the backdoor and the C&C server.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (collecting information, using HTTP/TCP for C&C, and then executing additional commands) is a logical and common sequence in APT operations.
     - It aligns with the typical behavior of APT groups, where initial reconnaissance and data collection are followed by establishing a C&C channel to receive further instructions.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with the known TTPs of the Naikon APT group.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
