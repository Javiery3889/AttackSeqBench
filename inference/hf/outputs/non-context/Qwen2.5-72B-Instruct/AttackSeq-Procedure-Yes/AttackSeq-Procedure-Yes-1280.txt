### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Tropic Trooper threat group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Initial access via exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities.
     2. Downloading and installing an MSI package.
     3. Executing malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper.
     4. Establishing persistence by decrypting the configuration file.
     5. Connecting to the command-and-control (C2) servers via SSL.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Downloading and Installing an MSI Package:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attacker downloads and installs an MSI package. This is a plausible next step to deploy the malware.
   - **Executing Malicious Documents:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.
     - Typically, the dropper is executed to install the backdoor and set up persistence.
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The backdoor decrypts its configuration file to establish persistence. This is a crucial step to ensure the malware remains on the system.
   - **Connecting to C2 Servers:**
     - Finally, the backdoor connects to the C2 servers via SSL to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploit a vulnerability to gain a foothold.
     2. **Malware Deployment:** Download and install the malware.
     3. **Execution of Dropper:** Execute the dropper to install the backdoor.
     4. **Persistence:** Decrypt the configuration file to establish persistence.
     5. **C2 Communication:** Connect to the C2 servers.
   - The dropper must be executed before the backdoor can establish persistence and connect to the C2 servers. Therefore, it is likely that the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
