### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Collection Phase:** Exfiltrating data using SmartFTP Client.
     - **Impact Phase:** Deploying RYUK ransomware a week later using both manual and scripted methods, including remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Exfiltrating data using SmartFTP Client is a common technique in the Collection phase. This is plausible as attackers often use legitimate tools to exfiltrate data to avoid detection.
   - **Impact Phase:**
     - Deploying RYUK ransomware a week later is also plausible. Ransomware is often deployed after the initial data exfiltration to maximize the impact and leverage the stolen data for ransom negotiations.
     - Using both manual and scripted methods for deployment is a common approach to ensure the ransomware spreads effectively and efficiently.
     - Remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec is a well-documented technique used by attackers to deploy ransomware across a network. WMI and PsExec are powerful tools that allow for remote execution of commands, making them ideal for spreading ransomware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the plausibility of each step in the sequence and the alignment with known TTPs, the most likely answer is that the described sequence of TTPs is indeed plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
