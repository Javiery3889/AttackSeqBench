### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a spyware.
   - The first TTP is **Credential Access** by extracting Chrome passwords from SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.
   - The second TTP is **Collection** by performing keylogging using `libCache32.exe`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access**: Extracting Chrome passwords is a common technique used by malware to gain access to user credentials. This is typically done by querying the SQLite databases where Chrome stores passwords.
   - **Collection**: Keylogging is a technique used to collect keystrokes, which can capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data.
   - **Tool Usage**: The question mentions `libchrome.exe` for extracting Chrome passwords and `libCache32.exe` for keylogging. While `libchrome.exe` is a known tool for extracting Chrome passwords, `libCache32.exe` is not a standard tool for keylogging. The name `libCache32.exe` suggests it might be related to caching, not keylogging.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of `libchrome.exe` for Credential Access is plausible and aligns with known techniques.
   - However, the use of `libCache32.exe` for keylogging is less plausible because it is not a known tool for this purpose. Keylogging typically involves different tools or methods, such as hooking keyboard events or using specific keylogging software.
   - Given the mismatch between the tool and the technique, it is less likely that the spyware would use `libCache32.exe` for keylogging.

### Final Answer:
B: No
