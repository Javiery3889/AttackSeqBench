### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of a known vulnerability in MS Exchange (CVE-2021-26855) for initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers used DLL hijacking to execute the ShadowPad backdoor before stealing domain authentication credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2021-26855**: This vulnerability is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server. It allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.
   - **Initial Access**: Exploiting CVE-2021-26855 would give the attacker initial access to the network.
   - **DLL Hijacking**: This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a directory where a legitimate application will load it, leading to the execution of the attacker's code.
   - **ShadowPad Backdoor**: ShadowPad is a sophisticated backdoor that has been used in targeted attacks. It is typically used to maintain persistence and gain remote access to the compromised system.
   - **Stealing Domain Authentication Credentials**: This involves techniques like credential dumping (e.g., using Mimikatz) to extract domain credentials from the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Initial Access**: The exploitation of CVE-2021-26855 is a common initial access vector.
   - **DLL Hijacking**: While DLL hijacking can be used to execute malicious code, it is not a typical next step after gaining initial access through a web application vulnerability. It is more commonly used in the context of exploiting local applications or services.
   - **Executing ShadowPad**: After gaining initial access, it is more likely that the attackers would use a more direct method to deploy the ShadowPad backdoor, such as using a web shell or other remote code execution techniques.
   - **Stealing Domain Authentication Credentials**: Once the backdoor is in place, the attackers can use it to perform further actions, including stealing domain credentials.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (DLL hijacking to execute ShadowPad before stealing domain credentials) is less plausible compared to a more direct method of deploying the backdoor after gaining initial access.

### Final Answer: B: No
