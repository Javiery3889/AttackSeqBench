### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows to gain initial access.
   - The attacker then uses CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 to achieve privilege escalation.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stager Module:**
     - A Stager module is typically used to load a small piece of code that will then download and execute a larger payload. This is often used to minimize the initial footprint and avoid detection.
     - The Stager module is responsible for establishing a connection to the command and control (C2) server and downloading the next stage of the attack.
   - **Dropper Module:**
     - A Dropper module is a piece of malware that is downloaded and executed by the Stager. It is responsible for deploying the final payload, which could be a backdoor, ransomware, or other malicious software.
   - **Notification:**
     - In a typical attack sequence, the Stager module would notify the C2 server of successful exploitation and then proceed to download and execute the Dropper module.
     - The notification is usually a part of the Stager's functionality to ensure that the C2 server is aware of the successful compromise and can proceed with the next steps.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical behavior of Stager and Dropper modules, it is likely that the Stager module will notify the C2 server of successful exploitation before downloading and executing the Dropper module.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
