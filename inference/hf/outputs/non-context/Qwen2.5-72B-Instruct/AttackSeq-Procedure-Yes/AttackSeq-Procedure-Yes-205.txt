### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to execute the SparrowDoor backdoor.
     2. **Discovery**: Collecting system information and probing files.
     3. **Credential Access**: Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to execute a backdoor is a common technique for initial access and execution. This aligns with the known TTPs of many threat actors, including FamousSparrow.
   - **Discovery**: After gaining initial access, it is typical for threat actors to perform discovery to understand the environment they are in. This includes collecting system information and probing files to identify valuable data and potential targets.
   - **Credential Access**: Once the threat actor has a better understanding of the environment, they often move to credential access to gain further access and privileges. Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials is a well-documented technique for credential access.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Execution**: Gain initial access and execute the backdoor.
     2. **Discovery**: Gather information about the system and network.
     3. **Credential Access**: Use the gathered information to dump credentials and gain further access.
   - This sequence is consistent with the known TTPs of FamousSparrow and other sophisticated threat actors.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
