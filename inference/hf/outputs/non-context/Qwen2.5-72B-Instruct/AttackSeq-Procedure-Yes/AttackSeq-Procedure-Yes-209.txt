### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the use of SparrowDoor, a tool used for Command and Control (C&C) communication.
   - It mentions that SparrowDoor uses HTTPS for communication and multi-byte XOR keys for encryption.
   - The question asks whether FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SparrowDoor and C&C Communication:**
     - SparrowDoor is a tool designed for C&C communication, which is a crucial step in maintaining control over compromised systems.
     - It uses HTTPS and multi-byte XOR keys to ensure that the communication is secure and difficult to detect or intercept.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Data exfiltration is a common goal of many cyber attacks, where sensitive data is stolen and sent to an attacker-controlled server.
     - C&C channels are often used for more than just maintaining control; they can also be used to exfiltrate data.
   - **FamousSparrow:**
     - FamousSparrow is a known threat actor that has been associated with various cyber attacks, including data exfiltration.
     - Given the capabilities of SparrowDoor and the goals of FamousSparrow, it is reasonable to assume that they would use the C&C channel for data exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that FamousSparrow would use SparrowDoor to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
