### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Stuxnet.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Exploiting the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability.
     - Exploiting the MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerability for lateral movement.
   - The question then asks whether Stuxnet is likely to communicate with its C&C (Command and Control) servers using encrypted channels to send system information and receive commands or updates.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stuxnet's Known TTPs:**
     - Stuxnet is a sophisticated piece of malware that was designed to target specific industrial control systems, particularly those used in Iran's nuclear program.
     - Stuxnet is known for its advanced capabilities, including the use of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities for initial infection and lateral movement.
     - Stuxnet's communication with C&C servers is a critical part of its operation, as it needs to receive updates and commands to carry out its mission.
   - **Encryption in Stuxnet:**
     - Given the sophisticated nature of Stuxnet, it is highly likely that the malware would use encrypted channels to communicate with its C&C servers. This is a common practice in advanced malware to avoid detection and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.
     - Encryption helps in evading network monitoring and analysis, which is crucial for maintaining the stealth and effectiveness of the malware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known capabilities and sophistication of Stuxnet, it is highly likely that Stuxnet would use encrypted channels to communicate with its C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
