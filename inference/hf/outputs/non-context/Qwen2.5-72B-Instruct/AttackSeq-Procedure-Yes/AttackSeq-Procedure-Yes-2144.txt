### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a malware might use.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Achieving persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.
     2. Performing process discovery by identifying the explorer process.
     3. Establishing command and control (C2) through Process Hollowing.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via RunOnce Key:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. It is a valid first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Process Discovery:**
     - After achieving persistence, malware often performs process discovery to understand the environment and identify potential targets or processes to manipulate. Identifying the explorer process is a plausible step, as the explorer process is a common target for injection or manipulation.
   - **Command and Control (C2) via Process Hollowing:**
     - Process Hollowing is a technique where malware creates a new process in a suspended state, unmaps its memory, and then writes its own code into the process's memory space. This is a common method for establishing C2 communication while evading detection.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is logically sound. After achieving persistence, the malware would likely perform process discovery to identify suitable processes for manipulation. Once the target process (e.g., explorer) is identified, the malware can then use Process Hollowing to establish C2 communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the common practices in malware behavior, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
