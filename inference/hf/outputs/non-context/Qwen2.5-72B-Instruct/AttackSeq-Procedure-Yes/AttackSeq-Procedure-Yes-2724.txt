### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence starts with the use of the credential harvesting tool Responder to acquire login credentials.
   - The question then asks if the group is likely to conduct discovery activities (such as system network configuration and process discovery) before using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Responder**: This tool is commonly used to capture network credentials by responding to LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBNS (NetBIOS Name Service) requests. Once credentials are harvested, the attacker has the necessary information to authenticate to other systems.
   - **Discovery Activities**: Before moving laterally, it is common for attackers to gather information about the network and systems. This includes discovering network configurations, identifying running processes, and mapping the network topology. This information helps the attacker understand the environment and plan the next steps.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Once the attacker has the necessary credentials and network information, they can use various tools and commands (such as Windows commands and WMIC) to move laterally within the network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Logical Sequence**: The logical sequence of actions for an attacker would be:
     1. Harvest credentials using Responder.
     2. Conduct discovery activities to understand the network and system configurations.
     3. Use the harvested credentials and discovered information to move laterally within the network.
   - **Common Practice**: Discovery activities are a crucial step in the attack lifecycle. They help the attacker avoid detection and ensure that the lateral movement is successful and efficient.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
