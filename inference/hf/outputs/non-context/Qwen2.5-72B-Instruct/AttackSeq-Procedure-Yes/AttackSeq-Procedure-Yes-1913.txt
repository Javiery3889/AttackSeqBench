### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Internal Reconnaissance:** Using common Windows tools.
     - **Later Stages:** Using open-source pentesting tools.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure.
     - **Exploitation:** Targeting systems that share access and credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT10 Background:**
     - APT10, also known as Stone Panda, MenuPass, and Red Apollo, is a sophisticated threat actor known for targeting managed service providers (MSPs) and other organizations.
     - APT10 has been observed using a variety of tools and techniques, including both common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools, to conduct reconnaissance and move laterally within networks.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - APT10 often uses built-in Windows tools like `netstat`, `ipconfig`, and `net` commands for initial reconnaissance.
     - They may also use more advanced tools like `Mimikatz` for credential dumping and `PowerShell` for scripting and automation.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - APT10 has been known to exploit shared infrastructure, particularly in the context of MSPs, to move laterally between different victim networks.
     - They leverage shared access and credentials to gain unauthorized access to multiple systems.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - APT10 targets systems with shared access and credentials, often using techniques like pass-the-hash and pass-the-ticket to gain elevated privileges and move deeper into the network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known TTPs of APT10, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible. APT10 is known to use a combination of common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for reconnaissance, and they leverage shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally and exploit systems with shared access and credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
