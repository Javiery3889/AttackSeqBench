### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the callCam app.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** The app collects extensive information from compromised devices.
     - **Collection Phase:** The app encrypts the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** The app sends the encrypted data to the C&C (Command and Control) server using a customized encoding routine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where the malware gathers information about the compromised system. This is plausible and aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Collection Phase:** Encrypting the collected data using RSA and AES is a reasonable step to protect the data from being intercepted or tampered with during transmission. RSA is often used for key exchange, and AES is used for bulk data encryption. This is a common practice in sophisticated malware to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** Using a customized encoding routine to send the data to the C&C server is also a common technique to avoid detection by network security systems. Customized encoding can help the data blend in with normal traffic or evade signature-based detection.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and aligns with known TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Each phase (Discovery, Collection, and Exfiltration) is a plausible and common step in a cyber attack.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
