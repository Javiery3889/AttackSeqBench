### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Aria-body backdoor.
   - The backdoor first gathers detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the **Discovery** phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely to proceed towards creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the **Collection** phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase is typically used by attackers to gather information about the target system to understand its environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.
     - The activities mentioned (gathering system information, hostname, and public IP) are common in the Discovery phase.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The Collection phase involves gathering data from the target system that the attacker finds valuable.
     - Activities such as creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities are typical in the Collection phase.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - It is logical for an attacker to move from the Discovery phase to the Collection phase after gathering initial information.
     - The information gathered during the Discovery phase can help the attacker decide what data to collect and how to collect it.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical progression of TTPs and the typical sequence of attack phases, it is likely that the Aria-body backdoor would proceed to the Collection phase after the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
