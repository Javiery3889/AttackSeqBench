### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the TDrop2 malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Activities:** Collecting system and network information.
     - **C2 Communication:** Communicating with Command and Control (C2) servers.
     - **Encryption and Encoding:** Using encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
     - **Custom Base64 Alphabet:** Leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** It is common for malware to perform discovery activities to gather information about the compromised system and network. This helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **C2 Communication:** After discovery, malware often needs to communicate with C2 servers to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Encryption and Encoding:** Using encrypted and base64-encoded commands is a common technique to obfuscate communication and avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **Custom Base64 Alphabet:** Using a custom base64 alphabet is a more advanced technique to further obfuscate the communication, making it harder for security tools to recognize and decode the traffic.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common TTPs used by sophisticated malware.
   - TDrop2, being a known malware, is likely to use advanced techniques to evade detection and maintain stealth.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
