### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the initial execution of CozyDuke via `rundll32.exe`.
   - It then asks if CozyDuke is likely to use techniques like registry manipulation or COM-object hijacking for persistence before registering itself as a Windows service or scheduled task.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Manipulation:** This technique involves modifying the Windows registry to ensure that the malware runs at system startup. This is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - **COM-Object Hijacking:** This technique involves hijacking COM (Component Object Model) objects to execute malicious code when legitimate applications are run. This can also be used for persistence.
   - **Windows Service or Scheduled Task:** These are more straightforward methods for achieving persistence, where the malware registers itself to run at system startup or at specific intervals.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - CozyDuke, also known as CozyBear, is a sophisticated piece of malware that has been known to use multiple techniques for persistence to ensure it remains active on the infected system.
   - Given its sophistication, it is highly likely that CozyDuke would use more stealthy and less detectable methods like registry manipulation or COM-object hijacking before resorting to more obvious methods like registering as a Windows service or scheduled task.
   - Registry manipulation and COM-object hijacking are often used in the early stages of an attack to establish a foothold and ensure that the malware can survive system reboots and other disruptions.
