### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Decrypting and saving a spying library to the user's temporary folder.
     - Loading the library and injecting malicious code into `explorer.exe`.
     - Ensuring persistence by copying itself to the `System32` directory and creating services initiated at system startup.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is likely to ensure persistence by copying itself to the `System32` directory and creating services initiated at system startup.
     - This is a common persistence technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts.
     - Copying to `System32` and creating services are both effective methods to achieve persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware is not likely to ensure persistence in this manner.
     - This would be less common, as ensuring persistence is a critical step for many types of malware to maintain control over the system.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the malware would take steps to ensure persistence.
   - Copying itself to the `System32` directory and creating services are well-known and effective methods for achieving persistence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the malware would indeed take these steps.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
