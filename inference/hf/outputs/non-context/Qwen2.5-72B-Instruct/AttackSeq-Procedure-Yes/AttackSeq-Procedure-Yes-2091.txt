### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where attackers have:
     - Discovered and mapped the organization's internal network using the Cobalt Strike beacon.
     - Collected administrative-level credentials.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will indeed move laterally across the infrastructure.
     - Given that the attackers have already discovered the network and obtained administrative-level credentials, they have the necessary tools and access to move laterally.
     - Lateral movement is a common next step in an attack sequence to gain further control and access to more systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers will not move laterally.
     - This is less likely because the attackers have already invested significant effort in reconnaissance and credential harvesting, which are typically precursors to lateral movement.
     - Not moving laterally would mean the attackers are not fully leveraging their obtained credentials and network knowledge, which is uncommon in advanced attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
