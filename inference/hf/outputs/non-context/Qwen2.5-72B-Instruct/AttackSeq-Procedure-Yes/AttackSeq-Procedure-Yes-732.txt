### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Iranian state-backed hackers used phishing attacks to gain initial access.
   - The targets were individuals involved in sanctions against Iran.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the hackers tailored their targeting approach by gathering information about the victim's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Tailoring the targeting approach by gathering detailed information about the victim is a common and effective strategy in advanced phishing attacks.
     - This information can help in creating more convincing and personalized phishing emails or social media messages.
     - State-backed hackers often have the resources and motivation to conduct thorough reconnaissance to increase the success rate of their attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the hackers did not gather detailed information about the victims.
     - This is less likely because advanced and state-backed hackers typically invest significant effort in reconnaissance to ensure their attacks are successful.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** Phishing attacks are more effective when they are tailored to the specific victim.
   - **Step 2:** State-backed hackers, such as those from Iran, have the resources and motivation to conduct thorough reconnaissance.
   - **Step 3:** Gathering information about the victim's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location can significantly increase the likelihood of a successful phishing attack.
   - **Step 4:** Given the context of the attack and the nature of state-backed hackers, it is highly likely that they would tailor their approach.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
