### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers:
     - Scan for and exploit vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers to gain initial access.
     - Use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.
     - Employ the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence is likely.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       - **Initial Access:** Scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers is a common initial access technique (MITRE ATT&CK T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application).
       - **Pivoting:** Using the infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network is a plausible next step (MITRE ATT&CK T1090: Proxy, T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer).
       - **Lateral Movement:** Employing the Explosive Trojan to infect connected USB devices is a method of lateral movement (MITRE ATT&CK T1091: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, T1076: Valid Accounts, T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information).

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence is not likely.
     - If we consider the sequence:
       - **Initial Access:** Scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities is a common and logical first step.
       - **Pivoting:** Using the infected servers as a pivot is a standard technique for spreading within a network.
       - **Lateral Movement:** Using USB devices for lateral movement is less common but not unheard of, especially in environments where network segmentation is weak or USB devices are frequently used.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and logical attack path. While using USB devices for lateral movement is less common than other methods (like network-based techniques), it is still a valid and sometimes used technique, especially in targeted attacks.
   - Therefore, the sequence is likely to occur in a real-world scenario.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
