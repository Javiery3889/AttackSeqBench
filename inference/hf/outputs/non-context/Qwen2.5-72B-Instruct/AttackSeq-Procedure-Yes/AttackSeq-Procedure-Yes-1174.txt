### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the group uses publicly available exploits to scan and exploit vulnerable systems for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the question asks whether the group is likely to obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access before deploying custom malware for Command and Control (C2) operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the group will obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access before deploying custom malware for C2 operations.
     - This is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios. After gaining initial access, attackers often seek to escalate privileges and obtain legitimate credentials to blend in with normal network traffic and maintain long-term access.
     - Using legitimate credentials can help the attackers avoid detection by security systems and maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the group will not obtain legitimate credentials and will directly deploy custom malware for C2 operations.
     - While it is possible for attackers to deploy custom malware immediately, it is less common and riskier. Without legitimate credentials, the attackers may be more easily detected and their access could be quickly revoked.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common practices in APT scenarios and the benefits of using legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described by Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
