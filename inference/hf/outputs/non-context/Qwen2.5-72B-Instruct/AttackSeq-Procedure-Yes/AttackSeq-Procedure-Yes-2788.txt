### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing itself in the background.
     - Hiding its icon.
     - Restarting when terminated.
     - Collecting geo-location data.
     - Sending the collected data to a C&C server via HTTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent app will indeed collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the data to the C&C server.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced malware, which often includes data collection and exfiltration as part of its routine operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the XAgent app will not collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine.
     - This is less likely, as collecting geo-location data is a common tactic used by malware to gather information about the victim's location, which can be valuable for further attacks or for tracking purposes.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the XAgent app, which includes background execution, icon hiding, and auto-restart, it is highly plausible that it would also include geo-location data collection as part of its routine.
   - Collecting and exfiltrating geo-location data is a common tactic in advanced malware to gather additional information about the victim, which can be used for various malicious purposes.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
