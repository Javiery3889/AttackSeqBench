### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Grandoreiro will employ techniques to steal credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.
   - The key elements are:
     - Collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.
     - Stealing credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Grandoreiro** is a well-known banking trojan that has been active since 2013. It is designed to steal banking credentials and other sensitive information.
   - **Initial Information Collection:**
     - Collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This information helps the attacker understand the environment and tailor their attack.
   - **Credential Theft:**
     - Stealing credentials from web browsers (like Google Chrome) and email clients (like Microsoft Outlook) is a common technique used by banking trojans to gain access to financial accounts and other sensitive information.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question (initial information collection followed by credential theft) is a plausible and common attack pattern for a banking trojan like Grandoreiro.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the nature of Grandoreiro and the common attack patterns it follows, it is highly likely that Grandoreiro will employ techniques to steal credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
