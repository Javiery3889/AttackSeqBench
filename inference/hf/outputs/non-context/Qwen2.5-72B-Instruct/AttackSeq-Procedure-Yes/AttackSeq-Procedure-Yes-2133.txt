### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Konni APT Group.
   - The sequence involves collecting information using a script called `versioninfo.bat`.
   - The question then asks if this collected data is likely to be sent through another script called `unactivate.vbs` before being exfiltrated via a POST request.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Understanding the Scripts:**
     - `versioninfo.bat` is likely a batch script used to gather system information such as OS version, installed software, and other relevant details.
     - `unactivate.vbs` is a VBScript, which could be used for various purposes, including encoding, compressing, or formatting the collected data before exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration Process:**
     - Exfiltration via a POST request is a common method used by APT groups to send collected data to a remote server.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that the Konni APT Group would use an intermediate script like `unactivate.vbs` to process the collected data before exfiltration. This could help in obfuscating the data, reducing its size, or ensuring it is in a format suitable for transmission.
     - However, the question does not provide specific details about the functionality of `unactivate.vbs`, which makes it less certain but still a reasonable assumption.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** The Konni APT Group collects information using `versioninfo.bat`.
   - **Step 2:** The collected data is likely processed in some way before exfiltration.
   - **Step 3:** Using `unactivate.vbs` to process the data before exfiltration is a plausible step, as it aligns with common APT group practices.
   - **Step 4:** The final step is exfiltration via a POST request.

### Final Answer
Given the plausible sequence of actions and the common practices of APT groups, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
