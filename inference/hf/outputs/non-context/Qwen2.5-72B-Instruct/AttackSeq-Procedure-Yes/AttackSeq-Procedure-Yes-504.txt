### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SombRAT backdoor in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:**
       - Process Discovery
       - System Information Discovery
     - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
       - Communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - **Process Discovery:** This technique involves the backdoor identifying running processes on the compromised system to understand the environment and potentially identify targets for further exploitation.
     - **System Information Discovery:** This technique involves the backdoor gathering information about the system, such as OS version, installed software, and network configuration, to better understand the environment and plan subsequent actions.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - **Protocol Tunneling over DNS and HTTP:** This technique involves the backdoor using DNS and HTTP protocols to communicate with C2 servers. DNS tunneling is often used to bypass network security measures, as DNS traffic is typically allowed through firewalls. HTTP tunneling is also common because HTTP traffic is often not closely monitored.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Process Discovery and System Information Discovery** are common initial steps in many cyber attacks. They help the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Protocol Tunneling over DNS and HTTP** is a common technique for establishing a C2 channel. DNS tunneling is particularly useful for evading detection, and HTTP tunneling is common because it blends in with normal web traffic.
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns. After discovering the environment, the backdoor would likely establish a C2 channel to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
