### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Milestone backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - System information discovery
     - Screen capture
     - Communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server over an application layer protocol
     - Exfiltration of data through the same C2 channel

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. The attacker gathers information about the system to understand its environment and capabilities.
   - **Screen Capture:** This technique is often used to gather visual information about the user's activities, which can be valuable for further exploitation or reconnaissance.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:** After gathering information, the malware typically needs to communicate with a C2 server to send the collected data and receive further instructions.
   - **Exfiltration of Data:** The final step in the sequence is the exfiltration of the collected data, which is often done through the same C2 channel to maintain stealth and efficiency.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This choice suggests that the Milestone backdoor will indeed communicate with a C2 server over an application layer protocol before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.
   - **B: No:** This choice suggests that the Milestone backdoor will not communicate with a C2 server over an application layer protocol before exfiltrating data.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common TTPs used by malware. After discovering system information and capturing the screen, it is highly likely that the malware will communicate with a C2 server to send the collected data and receive further instructions.
   - Exfiltration of data through the same C2 channel is a common practice to maintain stealth and efficiency, as it reduces the number of communication points and the risk of detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
