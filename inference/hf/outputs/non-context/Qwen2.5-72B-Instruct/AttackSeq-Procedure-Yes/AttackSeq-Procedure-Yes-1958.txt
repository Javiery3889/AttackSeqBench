### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the StellarParticle campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial Access: Logging into a public-facing system using SSH with stolen credentials and employing VPNs.
     - Persistence: Configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence and GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry.
     - Defense Evasion: Stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Logging into a public-facing system using SSH with stolen credentials is a common initial access technique.
     - Employing VPNs to persist in the victim's environment is also a plausible method for maintaining access.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence is a known technique for maintaining persistence on Windows systems.
     - Using GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry is a plausible method for maintaining persistence on Unix-like systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA is a sophisticated technique used to evade security measures and gain continued access to the victim's environment.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is logically consistent and follows a typical attack pattern:
     - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access using stolen credentials and a public-facing system.
     - **Persistence:** The attacker then configures malware to ensure they can maintain access over time.
     - **Defense Evasion:** Finally, the attacker uses advanced techniques to bypass security measures, such as MFA, to maintain their presence and access to the system.
