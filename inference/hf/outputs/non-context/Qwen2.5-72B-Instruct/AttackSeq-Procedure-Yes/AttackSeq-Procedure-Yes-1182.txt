### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with social engineering in malicious documents to trick victims into enabling macros.
   - After enabling macros, the payload is activated.
   - The next step involves creating multiple files, including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads.
   - Finally, the attack achieves persistence by adding script paths to the task scheduler.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - The sequence aligns with common attack patterns:
       - **Initial Access:** Social engineering via malicious documents to trick victims into enabling macros.
       - **Execution:** Payload activation through macros.
       - **Persistence:** Creating multiple files, including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads, and adding script paths to the task scheduler to ensure the malware runs automatically.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely.
     - This choice does not align with common attack patterns, as the described sequence is a well-documented and frequently used method in cyber attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible and common attack pattern.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is that the campaign will indeed create multiple files, including PowerShell scripts or obfuscated payloads, before achieving persistence by adding script paths to the task scheduler.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
