### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the A41APT campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing malicious payloads through DESLoader using DLL side-loading and fileless implants.
     - Establishing persistence by registering scheduled tasks that mimicked legitimate Windows tasks.
     - Performing internal network scanning to search for open RDP and SMB ports for credential access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       - **Executing malicious payloads through DESLoader using DLL side-loading and fileless implants:**
         - DESLoader is a known loader used in APT campaigns to execute malicious payloads.
         - DLL side-loading is a common technique where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL.
         - Fileless implants are used to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software.
       - **Establishing persistence by registering scheduled tasks that mimicked legitimate Windows tasks:**
         - Registering scheduled tasks is a common persistence technique.
         - Mimicking legitimate Windows tasks helps in evading detection.
       - **Performing internal network scanning to search for open RDP and SMB ports for credential access:**
         - Internal network scanning is a common post-exploitation technique to identify potential targets.
         - RDP and SMB ports are often targeted for credential access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - Given the detailed and plausible nature of the sequence, this choice seems less likely.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with known APT behaviors and techniques.
   - Each step in the sequence is a well-documented and plausible action in an APT campaign.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
