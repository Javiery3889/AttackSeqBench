### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by malware:
     - The malware executes by rewriting itself to the `%Temp%` folder.
     - It uses a randomized Hex-filename and a `.tmp` extension.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Malware often uses evasion techniques and obfuscation to avoid detection. Rewriting itself to the `%Temp%` folder with a randomized Hex-filename and a `.tmp` extension is a common evasion technique. This helps the malware blend in with legitimate temporary files and makes it harder for security tools to identify it.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the malware would not use evasion techniques or obfuscation. However, given the described behavior (rewriting to `%Temp%` with a randomized filename and `.tmp` extension), it is highly unlikely that the malware would not employ further evasion techniques.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the described behavior and common malware practices, it is highly likely that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
