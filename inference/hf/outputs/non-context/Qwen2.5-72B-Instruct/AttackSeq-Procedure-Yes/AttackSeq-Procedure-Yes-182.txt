### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a threat actor named "Infamous Chisel."
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using the `netd` component to discover files of interest from data directories.
     - Performing activities such as GPS information collection.
     - Deploying `tcpdump` to sniff network interfaces and monitor network traffic.
     - Exfiltrating files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using `netd` to Discover Files:**
     - `netd` is a network daemon in Android that can be used to manage network interfaces and services. However, it is not typically used to discover files directly. The question might be referring to a custom or modified version of `netd` that includes file discovery capabilities.
   - **GPS Information Collection:**
     - Collecting GPS information is a common technique used by malware to gather location data, which can be useful for various purposes, including exfiltration or targeting specific regions.
   - **Deploying `tcpdump`:**
     - `tcpdump` is a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic. Deploying `tcpdump` to monitor network interfaces is a logical step if the threat actor wants to understand the network environment or capture sensitive data.
   - **Exfiltrating Files Using Tor and SSH:**
     - Exfiltrating files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections is a sophisticated method to avoid detection and ensure the data is securely transmitted.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible. It follows a logical progression:
     - **Initial Reconnaissance:** Discovering files and collecting GPS information.
     - **Network Monitoring:** Deploying `tcpdump` to monitor network traffic.
     - **Data Exfiltration:** Using Tor and SSH to exfiltrate files securely and regularly.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the sophistication of the techniques described, it is likely that Infamous Chisel would follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
