### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the NanHaiShu malware.
   - The sequence includes gathering system information (Volume Serial Number, IP Address, User Name) and uploading it to a C&C server via HTTP POST.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after the initial information gathering and upload, the malware will likely receive and execute additional scripts to exfiltrate sensitive data.
     - This is a common pattern in many malware operations. After initial reconnaissance and establishing a foothold, malware often receives additional commands or scripts to perform more advanced tasks, such as data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not receive and execute additional scripts for exfiltrating sensitive data.
     - This is less likely because malware often evolves its operations based on the information gathered and the commands received from the C&C server.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance and C&C Communication:**
     - The malware gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server. This is a typical first step in many malware operations to understand the environment and report back to the attacker.
   - **Receiving Additional Commands:**
     - Once the C&C server has the initial information, it is common for the server to send additional commands or scripts to the malware. These commands can include instructions to exfiltrate sensitive data, which is a primary goal of many malware operations.
   - **Execution of Additional Scripts:**
     - The use of JScript and VBScript for data exfiltration is a known technique. These scripts can be used to gather and send sensitive data back to the C&C server.

Given the common patterns in malware operations and the typical sequence of actions described, it is highly likely that the malware will receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
