### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to identify machines and services in the compromised network.
     - **Collection Phase:** Collecting data from local systems and network shared drives.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** Compressing the collected data using WinRAR and exfiltrating it via the megacmd tool.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan is consistent with the Discovery phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. These tools are commonly used to gather information about the network and identify potential targets.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Collecting data from local systems and network shared drives is a typical activity in the Collection phase. This step is necessary to gather the data that the threat actor intends to exfiltrate.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - Compressing the collected data using WinRAR and exfiltrating it via the megacmd tool is a common method for data exfiltration. WinRAR is used to compress the data to reduce its size and make it easier to transfer, while megacmd is a command-line tool for interacting with cloud storage services, which can be used to upload the compressed data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Discovery:** The threat actor uses various scanning tools to map the network and identify potential targets.
     2. **Collection:** The threat actor collects data from local systems and network shared drives.
     3. **Exfiltration:** The collected data is compressed and exfiltrated using a cloud storage tool.
   - Each step in the sequence is consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and typical TTPs used by threat actors.
