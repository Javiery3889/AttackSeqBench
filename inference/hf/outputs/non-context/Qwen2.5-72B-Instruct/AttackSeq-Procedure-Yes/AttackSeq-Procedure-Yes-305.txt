### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a Russian-language phishing campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Phishing campaign using malicious docx files.
     - Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter.
     - Malicious docx files containing obfuscated code.
     - Establishing communication with a compromised server for command and control (C2).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing Campaign:**
     - Phishing is a common initial access technique (T1192) used to deliver malicious payloads.
   - **Malicious docx Files:**
     - Malicious documents, such as docx files, are often used to deliver malware (T1204.002).
   - **Exploiting EPS Filter Vulnerability:**
     - Exploiting a vulnerability in the EPS filter is a specific technique that could be used to execute code on the victim's machine (T1203).
   - **Obfuscated Code:**
     - Obfuscation is used to hide the true nature of the code, making it harder to detect and analyze (T1027).
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Establishing communication with a C2 server is a common post-exploitation technique (T1090).

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - Phishing campaigns often use malicious documents to deliver payloads.
     - Exploiting a specific vulnerability (like the EPS filter) can be a method to execute code.
     - Obfuscation is a common technique to evade detection.
     - Establishing C2 communication is a standard post-exploitation step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the commonality of these TTPs in cyber attacks, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
