### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained through malicious JavaScript files downloaded from compromised domains via the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's website.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will execute commands to gather system information before sending the results back to the C&C servers identified by their IP addresses.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through malicious JavaScript files. This is a common technique used by attackers to execute code on a victim's machine.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - Once the malware is executed, it is common for the malware to gather system information. This information can include details about the operating system, installed software, network configuration, and other relevant data.
   - **Sending Information to C&C Servers:**
     - After gathering system information, the malware typically sends this information back to the Command and Control (C&C) servers. The C&C servers are often identified by their IP addresses or domain names.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is a common and logical sequence of actions for malware. It aligns with the typical behavior of malware that aims to establish a foothold, gather information, and communicate with its controllers.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with common malware behavior.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
