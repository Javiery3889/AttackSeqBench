### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor LYCEUM.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
     - Delivering DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
     - Deploying an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware.
     - Utilizing the dropped DanBot malware for execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - LYCEUM gains initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks. This is a common initial access technique used by many threat actors to gain unauthorized access to systems.
   - **Delivery of Malware:**
     - Once initial access is gained, LYCEUM delivers DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments. This is a typical method for delivering malware, especially in targeted attacks.
   - **Deployment of DanDrop:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would deploy an obfuscated macro tool like DanDrop to drop the DanBot malware. DanDrop is known to be an obfuscated macro tool used to drop malware, which aligns with the use of malicious Excel attachments.
   - **Execution of Arbitrary Commands:**
     - After the DanBot malware is dropped, it is used to execute arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`. This is a common post-exploitation technique to maintain control and perform further actions on the compromised system.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Password spraying and brute-force attacks are effective methods for gaining initial access, especially if the target has weak or reused passwords.
   - **Delivery of Malware:**
     - Spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments are a common vector for delivering malware. The use of Excel attachments with macros is a well-known technique to bypass security measures and execute malicious code.
   - **Deployment of DanDrop:**
     - DanDrop, being an obfuscated macro tool, is designed to drop malware like DanBot. This aligns with the use of malicious Excel attachments, as the macro can be used to execute the payload.
   - **Execution of Arbitrary Commands:**
     - Once the DanBot malware is dropped, it can be used to execute arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`, which is a common technique for maintaining control and performing further actions on the compromised system.
