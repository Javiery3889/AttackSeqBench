### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the threat actor, Earth Lusca, uses spear phishing and malicious JavaScript in watering hole attacks to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, they deploy the Cobalt Strike loader disguised as a system update service during the execution phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery during the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear phishing and malicious JavaScript in watering hole attacks are common techniques for gaining initial access. This aligns with the initial access phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploying the Cobalt Strike loader disguised as a system update service is a common technique for executing malicious code on the target system. This aligns with the execution phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Network service discovery is a crucial step in the discovery phase, where the attacker maps the network to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.
     - Tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan are commonly used for network service discovery. These tools help in identifying open ports, network services, and other useful information about the network.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that Earth Lusca has already gained initial access and executed malicious code, it is highly likely that they would proceed to the discovery phase to gather more information about the network.
   - Using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery is a logical and common next step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
