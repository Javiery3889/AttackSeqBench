### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the IEXPL0RE RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
   - The sequence includes:
     - Recording keystrokes.
     - Exfiltrating data such as passwords.
     - Communicating with a command and control (C2) server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the communication with the C2 server uses encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for exfiltration and further instructions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Recording Keystrokes and Exfiltrating Data:**
     - This is a common TTP for RATs. Keystroke logging (T1056) and data exfiltration (T1020, T1041) are well-documented techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:**
     - Communication with a C2 server is a critical step in the attack lifecycle. It allows the attacker to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.
     - Using encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for communication is a common technique to avoid detection by network security tools. This is because encrypted traffic (T1032) and standard web protocols (T1105) are less likely to be flagged as malicious.
   - **Encrypted HTTP POST and GET Methods:**
     - Encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) is widely used to secure communications. It provides confidentiality and integrity, making it a preferred method for C2 communication.
     - POST and GET methods are standard HTTP methods used for sending and receiving data, respectively. Using these methods in an encrypted form (HTTPS) is a common practice in C2 communication to blend in with normal web traffic.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common use of encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for C2 communication and data exfiltration, it is highly likely that the IEXPL0RE RAT would use these methods to communicate with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
