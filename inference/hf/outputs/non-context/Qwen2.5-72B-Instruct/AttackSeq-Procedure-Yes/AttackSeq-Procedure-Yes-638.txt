### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the NewCT RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Evading detection by checking CPU core count during execution.
     - Using large null-padded files to bypass AV engines.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the NewCT RAT will emit a network beacon during command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP 1: Evading detection by checking CPU core count during execution**
     - This technique is often used to avoid running in virtualized environments or on systems with a specific configuration, which can help the malware avoid detection by security researchers or automated analysis systems.
   - **TTP 2: Using large null-padded files to bypass AV engines**
     - This technique involves adding large amounts of null data to files to make them appear different to antivirus engines, which can help the malware avoid signature-based detection.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Once a malware has successfully evaded detection and established itself on a system, it typically needs to communicate with a command and control server to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities.
     - Emitting a network beacon is a common method for C2 communication, where the malware periodically sends a signal to the C2 server to indicate its presence and readiness to receive commands.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the NewCT RAT has successfully evaded detection using the described techniques, it is highly likely that it will proceed to establish C2 communication.
   - Emitting a network beacon is a standard and necessary step for C2 communication, as it allows the malware to maintain a persistent connection with the attacker's server.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
