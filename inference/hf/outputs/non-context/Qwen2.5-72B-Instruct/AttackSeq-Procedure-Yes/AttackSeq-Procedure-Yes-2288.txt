### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through spear-phishing using malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - It then asks if DNSpionage malware requires human interaction to execute payloads before maintaining persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing:**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails with malicious attachments or links. In this case, the attachment is a malicious Microsoft Office document.
   - **Malicious Microsoft Office Document:**
     - Malicious Office documents often contain macros or other executable content that can run when the document is opened.
   - **DNSpionage Malware:**
     - DNSpionage is a known malware that has been used in targeted attacks. It typically involves the use of malicious Office documents to gain initial access.
   - **Human Interaction:**
     - For many malicious Office documents, human interaction (e.g., enabling macros) is often required to execute the payload.
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - Once the malware is executed, it can create a scheduled task to maintain persistence. The task name 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0' is a common technique to blend in with legitimate system processes.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access through spear-phishing and a malicious Office document is a well-documented technique.
   - **Human Interaction:**
     - Malicious Office documents often require the user to enable macros or click on a link, which involves human interaction.
   - **Payload Execution:**
     - After the user interacts with the document, the payload (DNSpionage malware) is executed.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Once the payload is executed, the malware can create a scheduled task to ensure it runs again after the system is restarted or at regular intervals.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical behavior of DNSpionage malware and the common techniques used in such attacks, it is likely that human interaction is required to execute the payload before the malware can maintain persistence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
