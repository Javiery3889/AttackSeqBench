### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Staging data for exfiltration in multi-part archives.
     - Using compression tools.
     - Launching these tools via remote command execution scripts.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT10 will use dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2) infrastructure by employing tools like Robocopy and Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Staging Data for Exfiltration:**
     - APT10 is known to stage data for exfiltration, often using compression tools to reduce the size and make the data easier to transfer.
   - **Remote Command Execution:**
     - APT10 frequently uses remote command execution scripts to automate and control the exfiltration process.
   - **Dynamic-DNS Domains for C2:**
     - APT10 has been known to use dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Tools Used:**
     - **Robocopy:** This is a file copying tool used for file and directory replication. It is commonly used for data exfiltration but not typically for C2 communication.
     - **Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP):** This is a command-line secure file copy program. It is used for secure file transfers but not typically for C2 communication.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of dynamic-DNS domains for C2 is a plausible and well-documented technique used by APT10.
   - However, the question specifically asks if APT10 will use Robocopy and PSCP for C2 infrastructure.
   - Robocopy and PSCP are primarily used for file copying and secure file transfers, not for establishing and maintaining C2 communication.
   - Therefore, while APT10 might use dynamic-DNS domains for C2, it is unlikely that they would use Robocopy and PSCP for this purpose.
