### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - Gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries (Reconnaissance).
     - Dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials (Credential Access).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (Gathering Information):**
     - FIN13, like many advanced threat actors, often begins their operations with reconnaissance to understand the target environment. This can involve using native OS binaries to gather information about network and host configurations.
     - Common tools and commands for this include `ipconfig`, `netstat`, `net view`, `systeminfo`, and others.
   - **Credential Access (Dumping LSASS):**
     - Once the initial reconnaissance is complete, threat actors often move to credential access to gain higher privileges or access to other systems.
     - Dumping the LSASS process memory is a common technique to extract credentials, which can be done using tools like Mimikatz.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question (reconnaissance followed by credential access) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks. It aligns with the typical attack lifecycle where threat actors first gather information to plan their next steps and then use that information to gain deeper access.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common practices of advanced threat actors like FIN13, it is likely that they would perform reconnaissance before attempting to dump LSASS process memory for credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
