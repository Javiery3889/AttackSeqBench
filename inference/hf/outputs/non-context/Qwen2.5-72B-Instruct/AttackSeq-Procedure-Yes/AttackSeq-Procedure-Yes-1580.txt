### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a threat actor, specifically PowerStallion.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Utilizing the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol.
     - Using Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control (C2) channel.
     - Exfiltrating information by writing encrypted command results to a OneDrive subfolder using an XOR key 0xAA.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **RPC Protocol:**
     - RPC is a protocol that allows a program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction.
     - This is a common technique used by malware to communicate with a remote server or to execute commands on a remote system.

   - **Microsoft OneDrive as C2:**
     - OneDrive is a cloud storage service that can be used as a C2 channel. Malware can use OneDrive to store and retrieve commands, exfiltrate data, and communicate with the attacker.
     - This is a plausible and known technique used by various malware families, including PowerStallion.

   - **Exfiltration with XOR Encryption:**
     - XOR encryption is a simple and common method used to obfuscate data. Using a fixed XOR key (0xAA in this case) is a straightforward way to encrypt data before exfiltration.
     - Writing encrypted command results to a OneDrive subfolder is a logical step in the exfiltration process, as it ensures that the data is not easily readable by unauthorized parties.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly plausible that PowerStallion would use the RPC protocol, OneDrive as a C2 channel, and XOR encryption to exfiltrate information.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
