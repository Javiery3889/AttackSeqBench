### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Korplug variant of Mustang Panda.
   - The sequence involves data discovery, specifically collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, involving compressed and encrypted messages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Discovery:**
     - Data discovery is a common TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, often used to identify and collect sensitive information from a compromised system.
     - This step is crucial for any exfiltration process, as the attacker needs to know what data to steal.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Data exfiltration is another common TTP, where the collected data is transferred out of the compromised network.
     - Using a custom protocol for exfiltration is a sophisticated technique that can help evade detection by standard network monitoring tools.
   - **Custom Protocol:**
     - A custom protocol can involve various methods to obfuscate the data, such as compression and encryption.
     - Compression reduces the size of the data, making it less noticeable in network traffic.
     - Encryption ensures that the data is unreadable to anyone intercepting the traffic, adding an additional layer of security for the attacker.
   - **TCP:**
     - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol commonly used for data transfer over the internet.
     - Using TCP for exfiltration is a common choice because it ensures that the data is delivered reliably and in order.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophistication of Mustang Panda and the Korplug variant, it is highly likely that they would use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, involving compressed and encrypted messages. This approach aligns with the advanced capabilities of such malware, which often includes measures to avoid detection and ensure successful data theft.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
