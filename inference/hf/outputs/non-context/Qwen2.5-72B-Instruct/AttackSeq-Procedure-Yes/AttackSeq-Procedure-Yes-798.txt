### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using an LNK file to initiate multi-stage commands.
     - Executing a JavaScript file as part of the attack's execution phase.
     - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence.
     - Adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence before adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the JavaScript file will not copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence before adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:**
     - Copying a file to the startup directory and adding a file to scheduled tasks are both common persistence techniques used by APT groups.
     - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with typical APT behavior.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence of actions (executing a JavaScript file, copying a file to the startup directory, and adding a file to scheduled tasks) is a plausible and common attack pattern.
     - APT groups often use multiple persistence mechanisms to ensure they can maintain access to the compromised system.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common use of these persistence techniques, it is plausible that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence before adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
