### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a malware might follow after achieving persistence.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Persistence**: Creating a RunOnce key in the registry.
     2. **Discovery**: Obtaining the name of the user and identifying the explorer process.
     3. **Command and Control (C2)**: Establishing communication through Process Hollowing.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (RunOnce Key):**
     - Creating a RunOnce key in the registry is a common technique for achieving persistence. This ensures that the malware runs at the next system startup.
   - **Discovery (User Name and Explorer Process):**
     - After achieving persistence, it is logical for the malware to perform discovery to gather information about the environment. Obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process are typical discovery actions.
   - **Command and Control (Process Hollowing):**
     - Process Hollowing is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, often to establish a covert communication channel with a C2 server. This is a common method for maintaining command and control over the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
     1. **Persistence**: The malware ensures it will run again after the system restarts.
     2. **Discovery**: The malware gathers information about the user and the system to better understand the environment.
     3. **Command and Control**: The malware establishes a communication channel with the C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression and the common use of these techniques in malware, the sequence described is plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
