### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker has already created a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if the malware is likely to use InstallUtil.exe to evade detection by bypassing Smartscreen and AppLocker.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - Creating a scheduled task is a common technique for ensuring that malware persists across system reboots. This is part of the Persistence tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense Evasion is a tactic where attackers attempt to avoid detection and analysis. Techniques under this tactic include bypassing user and system defenses.
   - **InstallUtil.exe:**
     - InstallUtil.exe is a legitimate .NET Framework utility used to install and uninstall services. It can be abused by attackers to execute arbitrary code, which can help in evading detection mechanisms like Smartscreen and AppLocker.
   - **Smartscreen and AppLocker:**
     - Smartscreen is a feature in Windows that helps protect against potentially malicious software by checking the reputation of files.
     - AppLocker is a policy-based application control feature that allows administrators to specify which applications are allowed to run on a system.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware has already established persistence via a scheduled task, the next logical step would be to ensure that the malware can execute without being detected or blocked by security mechanisms.
   - InstallUtil.exe is a known tool that can be used to bypass these security mechanisms because it is a trusted .NET utility and can execute arbitrary code.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would use InstallUtil.exe to evade detection by Smartscreen and AppLocker.

### Final Answer:
