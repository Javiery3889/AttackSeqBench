### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Shuckworm malware.
   - Specifically, it inquires whether Shuckworm is likely to download additional payloads after communicating with C&C (Command and Control) servers and then use these payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Shuckworm will download additional payloads after communicating with C&C servers and use these payloads to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Shuckworm will not download additional payloads after communicating with C&C servers and will not use these payloads to maintain control over the compromised systems.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Shuckworm Malware:**
     - Shuckworm is known to be a sophisticated malware used in cyber espionage activities.
     - It typically communicates with C&C servers to receive commands and instructions.
     - Downloading additional payloads is a common tactic used by advanced malware to extend its capabilities and maintain persistence on the compromised system.
     - These additional payloads can include tools for data exfiltration, lateral movement, and maintaining control over the system.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the nature of Shuckworm and the common TTPs used in cyber espionage, it is highly likely that Shuckworm will download additional payloads after communicating with C&C servers to maintain control over the compromised systems.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
