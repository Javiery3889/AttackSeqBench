### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Bisonal dropper.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Setting up persistence by creating a registry entry.
     - Executing a decrypted DLL payload upon system reboot.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Bisonal variant will communicate with its C2 (Command and Control) addresses by sending an HTTP POST request for command and control operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Payload Execution:**
     - Setting up persistence by creating a registry entry is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts.
     - Executing a decrypted DLL payload upon system reboot is a typical follow-up action to maintain and extend the malware's presence on the system.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Once the malware is persistent and the payload is executed, the next logical step is for the malware to communicate with its C2 server to receive further commands or exfiltrate data.
     - HTTP POST requests are a common method for C2 communication because they can blend in with normal web traffic and are less likely to be detected by network security measures.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the Bisonal variant will communicate with its C2 addresses by sending an HTTP POST request for command and control operations. This is a standard behavior for malware that has established persistence and executed its payload.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
