### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a script named `stopedge.bat`.
   - The script is used to delete files (`versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs`) as a means of defense evasion.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the same script will contribute to persistence by scheduling the periodic execution of `install.vbs`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The deletion of files (`versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs`) is a common technique used to remove traces of the attacker's presence or to prevent the system from detecting or responding to the attack. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host).
   - **Persistence:**
     - Scheduling the periodic execution of `install.vbs` is a technique used to ensure that the attacker's tools or malware are re-executed after a system reboot or at regular intervals. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that a script used for defense evasion (deleting files) could also be used to establish persistence (scheduling the execution of another script). This is because both actions can be part of a broader attack strategy.
     - Attackers often use a combination of techniques to achieve their goals, and it is common for a single script to perform multiple tasks to maintain access to a system.
   - **Context:**
     - The script `stopedge.bat` is already performing actions to evade detection. It is logical that the same script could also be used to ensure that the attacker's presence is maintained on the system by scheduling the execution of `install.vbs`.
