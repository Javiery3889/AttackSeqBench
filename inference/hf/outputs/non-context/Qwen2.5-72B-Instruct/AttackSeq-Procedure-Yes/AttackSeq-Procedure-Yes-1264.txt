### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using an obfuscated batch script to execute a PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`).
     - Performing actions to maintain persistence.
     - The final step is to determine if the PowerShell script will lead to the installation of njRAT, a known remote access trojan (RAT), to establish command and control (C2) over the victim's computer.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the final PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`) will indeed lead to the installation of njRAT, which is a common tactic used by attackers to maintain control over a compromised system.
     - Obfuscated scripts and PowerShell are often used in the initial stages of an attack to execute malicious payloads and establish persistence.
     - njRAT is a well-known RAT that can be used to control a victim's computer remotely, making it a plausible final step in this sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the final PowerShell script will not lead to the installation of njRAT.
     - While it is possible that the script could perform other malicious actions, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the typical behavior of an attacker using obfuscated scripts and PowerShell to deploy a RAT like njRAT.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the final PowerShell script will lead to the installation of njRAT to establish command and control over the victim's computer.
   - The use of obfuscated scripts and PowerShell for initial execution and persistence is a common precursor to deploying a RAT.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
