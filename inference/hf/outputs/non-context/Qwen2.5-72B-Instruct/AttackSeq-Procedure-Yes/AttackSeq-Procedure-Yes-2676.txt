### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware ZoxPNG.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Communication with the victim's machine using the WinInet API.
     - Exploiting proxy settings for defense evasion.
     - Establishing contact with a C2 (Command and Control) server through an initial HTTP GET request.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after exploiting proxy settings for defense evasion, ZoxPNG is likely to establish contact with the C2 server using an initial HTTP GET request.
     - This is a common sequence in malware operations. Malware often uses the WinInet API to communicate over the network, and exploiting proxy settings can help evade detection by security systems. Once the malware has established a network connection and evaded defenses, it typically reaches out to a C2 server to receive further commands or to exfiltrate data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ZoxPNG is not likely to establish contact with the C2 server through an initial HTTP GET request after exploiting proxy settings.
     - This is less plausible because establishing contact with a C2 server is a crucial step for most malware to function effectively. Without this step, the malware would not be able to receive commands or exfiltrate data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common behavior of malware and the logical sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible answer is that ZoxPNG is likely to establish contact with the C2 server through an initial HTTP GET request after exploiting proxy settings for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
