### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers are using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will verify victims' credentials in real-time and subsequently prompt for the 2-step verification code.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If attackers are sophisticated enough to use images in phishing emails to evade detection, they are likely to have the capability to verify credentials in real-time and prompt for 2-step verification codes. This is a common tactic in advanced phishing attacks to maximize the success rate and ensure they capture all necessary authentication factors.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers would not verify credentials in real-time or prompt for 2-step verification codes. This is less likely given the sophistication of the initial evasion technique (using images in emails).

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The use of images in phishing emails to evade detection indicates a high level of sophistication and planning by the attackers.
   - Sophisticated attackers often employ real-time credential verification and 2-step verification prompts to ensure they capture all necessary information and increase the likelihood of successful account compromise.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that the attackers would verify credentials in real-time and prompt for 2-step verification codes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
