### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing the 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.'
     - Searching for files and targeting non-English filenames.
     - Collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - CosmicDuke is known to use various persistence mechanisms, including creating scheduled tasks and installing services with benign-sounding names like 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.' This aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Discovery Operations:**
     - CosmicDuke often performs discovery operations to gather information about the compromised system. This can include searching for files and targeting specific filenames. The question specifically mentions targeting non-English filenames, which is a plausible tactic to avoid detection and to focus on files that may contain sensitive information.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - CosmicDuke is known to use a variety of data collection techniques, including keylogging, taking screenshots, and stealing clipboard data. These actions are typically performed after the malware has established a presence on the system and has gathered some initial information.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known behavior of CosmicDuke. The malware first establishes persistence, then performs discovery operations to find relevant files, and finally collects data using various methods.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
