### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Welcome Chat app.
   - The app ensures persistence by auto-starting at device boot through the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast.
   - The app then collects device information and GPS location for discovery.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the app uploads exfiltrated data to its C&C (Command and Control) server using the HTTP protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Auto-starting at device boot):**
     - The app uses the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast to ensure it starts automatically when the device boots. This is a common technique for maintaining persistence on Android devices.
   - **Discovery (Collecting device information and GPS location):**
     - The app collects device information and GPS location, which is typical for reconnaissance and data exfiltration purposes.
   - **Exfiltration (Uploading data to C&C server using HTTP):**
     - HTTP is a common protocol used for data exfiltration because it is widely supported and can blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.
     - C&C servers are often used to receive exfiltrated data and issue commands to the compromised device.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly plausible that the app would use HTTP to exfiltrate the collected data to its C&C server. This is a common and effective method for maintaining communication and control over a compromised device.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
