### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - APT phishing email with a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
     - VBScript downloading and opening a .doc file.
     - Execution of the .doc file.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT Phishing Email:**
     - Phishing emails are a common initial access vector in APT campaigns.
   - **Malware Hosted on Geocities:**
     - Using legitimate but less monitored platforms like Geocities to host malware is a tactic to avoid detection.
   - **VBScript Downloading and Opening a .doc File:**
     - VBScript is often used to download and execute malware. Opening a .doc file can be a way to execute macros or other embedded code.
   - **Execution of the .doc File:**
     - .doc files can contain macros or other executable content that can run code.
   - **PowerShell Command Running Base64 Encoded Code:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that is often used in post-exploitation activities.
     - Base64 encoding is a common technique to obfuscate code and avoid detection.
   - **Malware Using PowerShell for Further Execution:**
     - Once the initial payload is executed, malware often uses PowerShell to perform further actions, such as establishing persistence, exfiltrating data, or moving laterally within the network.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the next step in the attack would involve running a PowerShell command with base64 encoded code. This is a common technique to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - The use of PowerShell for further execution is also a common tactic in APT campaigns to perform various post-exploitation activities.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
