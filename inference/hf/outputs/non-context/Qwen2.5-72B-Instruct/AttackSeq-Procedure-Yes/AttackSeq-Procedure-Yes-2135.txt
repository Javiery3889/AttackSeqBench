### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained via a phishing campaign delivering malware disguised as a Curriculum Vitae.
   - The question asks whether the initial malware sample is likely to communicate with the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` before using other identified C2 domains.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing:**
     - Phishing campaigns often deliver malware that is designed to establish a foothold in the target network.
     - The initial malware (often a dropper or loader) typically needs to communicate with a C2 server to receive further instructions or to download additional payloads.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The first communication with a C2 server is crucial for the malware to establish a persistent presence and to receive commands from the attacker.
     - It is common for the initial C2 domain to be hardcoded or configured in the initial malware sample to ensure reliable communication.
   - **Sequence of C2 Domains:**
     - If the initial malware sample is designed to communicate with a specific C2 domain (e.g., `judystevenson[.]info`), it is likely that this domain will be the first point of contact.
     - Subsequent C2 domains may be used for redundancy, to avoid detection, or to handle different stages of the attack.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware in such scenarios, it is likely that the initial malware sample will communicate with the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` before using other identified C2 domains.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
