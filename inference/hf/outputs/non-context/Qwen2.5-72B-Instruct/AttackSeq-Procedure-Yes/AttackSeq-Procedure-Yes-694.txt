### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the deployment of malicious attachments or web-links via spear-phishing and phishing mass-mailing to gain initial access.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that Russian-speaking cybercriminals will download programs for remote administration tools (RATs) to compromise systems' administrators' credentials during the execution phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing and phishing mass-mailing are common techniques used to gain initial access to a target system. These methods often involve tricking users into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments, which can lead to the execution of malware.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - Once initial access is gained, the next step in the attack lifecycle is often the execution of the malware. This can involve downloading additional tools or malware to further compromise the system.
   - **Remote Administration Tools (RATs):**
     - RATs are frequently used by cybercriminals to maintain persistent access to a compromised system and to perform various malicious activities, including credential theft.
   - **Compromising Administrators' Credentials:**
     - Compromising administrators' credentials is a common goal for cybercriminals as it provides them with high-level access to the network, allowing them to perform more extensive and damaging actions.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that Russian-speaking cybercriminals will download programs for remote administration tools to compromise systems' administrators' credentials during the execution phase.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that Russian-speaking cybercriminals will download programs for remote administration tools to compromise systems' administrators' credentials during the execution phase.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the typical attack lifecycle and the common tactics used by cybercriminals, it is highly plausible that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing or phishing, Russian-speaking cybercriminals would use RATs to maintain access and further compromise the system, including stealing administrators' credentials.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
