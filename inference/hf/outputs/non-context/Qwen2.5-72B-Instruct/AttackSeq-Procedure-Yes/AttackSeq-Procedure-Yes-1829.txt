### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a malicious app called "callCam."
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading detection through overlay screens during installation.
     - Collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.
     - Encrypting the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.
     - Exfiltrating the encrypted data to a C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       - **Evading Detection:** Overlay screens are a common technique used by malware to trick users into granting permissions or to hide malicious activities.
       - **Collecting Files and Screenshots:** Once the app is installed and has evaded detection, it is common for malware to collect sensitive data such as files and screenshots.
       - **Encrypting Data:** Encrypting the collected data using RSA and AES is a standard practice to protect the data during exfiltration and to prevent it from being intercepted.
       - **Exfiltration to C&C Server:** Exfiltrating the encrypted data to a C&C server is a typical final step in many malware operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - This would imply that the app does not follow the typical sequence of TTPs used by malware, which is less plausible given the detailed and logical sequence described.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the common practices in malware operations, the most plausible answer is that the callCam app will indeed follow the described sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
