### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group Charming Kitten.
   - The sequence starts with the Resource Development phase, where Charming Kitten created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Charming Kitten created fake websites to obtain credentials. This is a common technique used to gather initial access credentials, which can be used to gain entry into target systems or to further the attack.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The Reconnaissance phase involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute the attack. This can include identifying key personnel, understanding the target's infrastructure, and finding vulnerabilities.
   - **Targeting Non-Iranian Researchers:**
     - Charming Kitten is known to target individuals and organizations that are of interest to the Iranian government. This includes researchers, journalists, and other individuals who may have sensitive information or influence.
     - Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists is a plausible technique to gain the trust of the target and gather more information. This is a common social engineering tactic used in the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that Charming Kitten has a history of targeting individuals of interest to the Iranian government and that impersonating well-known figures is a common social engineering technique, it is likely that they would target non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
