### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the BlackEnergy malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Activation of BlackEnergy to assess if the infected computer is the intended target.
     2. Deployment of a regular BlackEnergy variant with XML configuration data containing a list of C&C servers and a unique build_id.
     3. Communication with C&C servers.
     4. Use of the KillDisk component to overwrite data and sabotage processes on industrial control systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will communicate with C&C servers before using the KillDisk component.
     - This is a plausible sequence because:
       - Malware often communicates with C&C servers to receive further instructions, updates, or additional payloads.
       - The C&C communication can provide the necessary commands to activate the KillDisk component.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not communicate with C&C servers before using the KillDisk component.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - Without C&C communication, the malware might lack the necessary instructions or triggers to activate the KillDisk component.
       - C&C communication is a common step in the attack lifecycle to ensure the malware is operating as intended and to receive any dynamic commands.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the described sequence, it is more likely that the BlackEnergy malware will communicate with C&C servers before using the KillDisk component.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
