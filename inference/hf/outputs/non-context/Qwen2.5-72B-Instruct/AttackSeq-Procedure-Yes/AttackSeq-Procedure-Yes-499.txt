### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **PowerShell injection** using the `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` PowerSploit module.
     - **SombRAT backdoor** for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
     - **Network service scanning** using tools like `pscan` and `nmap`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell Injection:**
     - `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` is a common technique used to execute PE (Portable Executable) files in memory without writing them to disk. This is often used to evade detection by antivirus software.
   - **SombRAT Backdoor:**
     - SombRAT is a known backdoor that can perform various activities, including process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery. These activities are typical for a backdoor to gather information about the compromised system.
   - **Network Service Scanning:**
     - Tools like `pscan` and `nmap` are commonly used for network service scanning to identify open ports and services on the network. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access and gathering system information.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - **Initial Access:** The attacker uses PowerShell injection to execute a payload in memory, which is a common initial access technique.
     - **Backdoor Deployment:** The SombRAT backdoor is then used to gather detailed information about the system, which is a typical next step to understand the environment and plan further actions.
     - **Reconnaissance:** Network service scanning using `pscan` and `nmap` is a logical follow-up to the initial information gathering, as it helps the attacker map the network and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
