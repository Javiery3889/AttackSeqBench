### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a backdoor, specifically one associated with the Waterbear malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **API Hooking:** Modifying functions like `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` to evade detection.
     - **Encryption/Decryption Key:** The presence of an encryption/decryption key in the backdoor configuration.
     - **XOR-Encrypted C&C Server Address:** The use of XOR encryption for the Command and Control (C&C) server address.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **API Hooking:** This technique is commonly used by malware to intercept and modify the behavior of system functions. By hooking `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable`, the malware can hide its presence and avoid detection by security software.
   - **Encryption/Decryption Key:** Malware often includes encryption/decryption keys to protect sensitive data, such as the C&C server address, from being easily discovered or tampered with.
   - **XOR-Encrypted C&C Server Address:** XOR encryption is a simple yet effective method to obfuscate data. It is commonly used by malware to hide the C&C server address, making it harder for security analysts to identify and block the communication.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware is using advanced techniques like API hooking to evade detection, it is highly likely that it would also use encryption to protect its C&C communication.
   - The use of an encryption/decryption key and XOR encryption for the C&C server address aligns with the sophisticated nature of the attack described.
   - Malware authors often employ multiple layers of obfuscation and encryption to ensure the persistence and stealth of their malware.

### Final Answer:
