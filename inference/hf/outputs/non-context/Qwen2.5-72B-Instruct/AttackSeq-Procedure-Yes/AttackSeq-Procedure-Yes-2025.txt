### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Seaduke malware.
   - The actions include retrieving detailed bot/system information, updating configurations, uploading/downloading files, securely deleting itself, and communicating with a C&C server.
   - The question also mentions that the communication with the C&C server is beneath layers of encoding and encryption.
   - Finally, it asks if Seaduke will archive sensitive information and exfiltrate data via legitimate cloud services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Seaduke will indeed communicate with the C&C server using layers of encoding and encryption and will then archive and exfiltrate sensitive information via legitimate cloud services.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced malware, which often uses sophisticated communication methods to avoid detection and exfiltrate data in a stealthy manner.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Seaduke will not communicate with the C&C server using layers of encoding and encryption or exfiltrate data via legitimate cloud services.
     - This is less likely, as advanced malware like Seaduke typically uses such methods to maintain stealth and ensure successful data exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of advanced malware and the specific actions described in the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Seaduke will communicate with the C&C server using layers of encoding and encryption and will exfiltrate data via legitimate cloud services.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
