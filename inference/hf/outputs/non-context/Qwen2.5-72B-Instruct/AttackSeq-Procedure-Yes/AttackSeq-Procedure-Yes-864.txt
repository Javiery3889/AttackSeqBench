### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by GreyEnergy operators.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Reconnaissance:** Targeting ICS control workstations.
     - **Data Extraction:** Extracting data, taking screenshots, and performing keylogging.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that GreyEnergy operators will develop capabilities by creating and deploying a modular malware framework tailored for espionage and reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy operators will indeed develop and deploy a modular malware framework.
     - Given the sophisticated nature of the initial TTPs (reconnaissance, data extraction, screenshots, keylogging), it is plausible that the operators would continue to evolve their capabilities.
     - Modular malware frameworks are often used by advanced threat actors to maintain persistence, adapt to different environments, and enhance their ability to perform espionage and reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy operators will not develop and deploy a modular malware framework.
     - This is less likely given the advanced and strategic nature of their initial activities. Advanced threat actors typically continue to evolve their tools and techniques to maintain their operational capabilities.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sophisticated and strategic nature of the initial TTPs and the common practices of advanced threat actors, it is highly likely that GreyEnergy operators will develop and deploy a modular malware framework.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
