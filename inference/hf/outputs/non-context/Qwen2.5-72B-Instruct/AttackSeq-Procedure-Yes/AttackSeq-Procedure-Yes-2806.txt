### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Hi-Zor RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
   - The sequence includes:
     - Creating a copy of itself with a '.dat' extension.
     - Embedding itself into the registry run key for persistence.
     - Using string-stacking and double XOR encoding for defense evasion.
     - Sending the victim's Volume Serial Number information in the beacon communication over a secure connection (e.g., TLS).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Creating a copy of itself with a '.dat' extension:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to disguise itself and avoid detection by security software.
   - **Embedding itself into the registry run key for persistence:**
     - This is a well-known persistence mechanism that ensures the malware runs every time the system starts.
   - **Using string-stacking and double XOR encoding for defense evasion:**
     - String-stacking and double XOR encoding are advanced techniques used to obfuscate code and data, making it harder for security tools to detect and analyze the malware.
   - **Sending the victim's Volume Serial Number information in the beacon communication over a secure connection (e.g., TLS):**
     - Beaconing is a common technique used by malware to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. Using a secure connection like TLS helps to encrypt the communication, making it more difficult to intercept and analyze.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. Each step is a common and logical progression in the lifecycle of a sophisticated malware like Hi-Zor RAT.
   - Creating a copy and embedding it in the registry for persistence are initial steps to ensure the malware remains on the system.
   - Using advanced obfuscation techniques like string-stacking and double XOR encoding is a logical next step to evade detection.
   - Finally, sending sensitive information over a secure connection is a common practice to maintain stealth and protect the data in transit.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
