### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Sednit group uses a Delphi downloader to gain execution, execute commands using Windows API, and send system information to a C&C server.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader will perform process discovery by gathering process lists from the victim's machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Delphi Downloader:**
     - The Delphi downloader is used to gain initial execution and send system information to the C&C server. This is a common initial step in many malware campaigns.
   - **AutoIt Downloader:**
     - The AutoIt downloader is another tool in the Sednit group's arsenal. It is often used for further stages of the attack, such as downloading additional payloads or performing more sophisticated actions.
   - **Process Discovery:**
     - Process discovery is a common technique used by malware to gather information about running processes on the victim's machine. This information can be used to identify security software, other running applications, or to determine the best course of action for the next steps in the attack.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the Sednit group is known for using multiple stages in their attacks, it is plausible that after the initial execution and information gathering by the Delphi downloader, the AutoIt downloader would be used to perform further reconnaissance, including process discovery.
   - Process discovery is a logical next step in the attack sequence because it helps the attackers understand the environment they are operating in and plan their next moves more effectively.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
