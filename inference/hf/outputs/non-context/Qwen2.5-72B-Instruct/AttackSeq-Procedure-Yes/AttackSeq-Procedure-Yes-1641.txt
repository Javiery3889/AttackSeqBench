### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the PurpleFox malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by modifying registry values under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`.
     - Replacing `sens.dll` to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).
   - The question asks whether PurpleFox is likely to remove old PurpleFox-related registry keys before leveraging rootkit drivers to hide the registry keys.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - Modifying registry values under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager` is a common technique for achieving persistence.
     - Replacing `sens.dll` to run as SENS is another method to ensure the malware runs with high privileges.
   - **Registry Key Management:**
     - Removing old registry keys can help in reducing the footprint and avoiding detection.
     - However, if the malware is already using rootkit drivers to hide registry keys, the need to remove old keys might be less critical.
   - **Rootkit Drivers:**
     - Rootkit drivers are used to hide the presence of the malware, including registry keys, processes, and files.
     - If the rootkit drivers are already in place, the malware can hide the old registry keys without needing to remove them.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence and Registry Modification:**
     - The malware has already achieved persistence and modified the registry to run as SENS.
   - **Registry Key Removal:**
     - While removing old registry keys can help in reducing the footprint, it is not always necessary if the malware can hide them using rootkit drivers.
   - **Rootkit Drivers:**
     - The use of rootkit drivers to hide registry keys is a more sophisticated and effective method to avoid detection.
     - Given that the malware is using rootkit drivers, it is more likely that it will rely on these drivers to hide the old registry keys rather than removing them.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
