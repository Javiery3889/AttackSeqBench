### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that attackers will shift their methods to use simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.
   - Finally, it asks if the attackers will target specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files is a known method for initial access. This is a plausible starting point for an attack.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion is a sophisticated technique. PostScript is a page description language, and EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files can be used to embed malicious code. This method can help evade detection by security systems.
   - **Targeting Specific Professions or Groups:**
     - After gaining initial access and evading defenses, it is common for attackers to target specific professions or groups with impersonated documents to collect sensitive information. This is a typical next step in a targeted attack.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files is a known and effective method for gaining initial access to a system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Shifting to simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files for defense evasion is a logical next step. This technique can help the attackers maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Collection:**
     - Targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns. This step is often used to gather specific information or to move laterally within the network.

### Final Answer
Given the logical progression of the attack sequence described, it is likely that attackers will shift their methods as outlined in the question.

Final Answer: A: Yes
