### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Infamous Chisel malware.
   - The sequence involves the Collection phase, where files are gathered based on predefined file extensions and from specific directories.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the netd component will exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections in the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Infamous Chisel is known for its capability to collect files based on predefined file extensions and from specific directories. This is a common technique used in the Collection phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The question specifically mentions the use of a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for exfiltration.
     - Tor hidden services are often used to anonymize the exfiltration process, making it harder to trace the data back to the attacker.
     - SSH connections can be used to securely transfer files, but they are not typically associated with Tor hidden services in the same context.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - While it is possible for an attacker to use both Tor and SSH for exfiltration, it is less common to see them used together in the same exfiltration process. Typically, one method is chosen for simplicity and effectiveness.
     - The use of a Tor hidden service alone is more plausible for exfiltration, as it provides strong anonymity and is a well-known technique in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the complexity and the less common combination of using both Tor and SSH for exfiltration, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely that the netd component will use both methods together.

**Final Answer: B: No**
