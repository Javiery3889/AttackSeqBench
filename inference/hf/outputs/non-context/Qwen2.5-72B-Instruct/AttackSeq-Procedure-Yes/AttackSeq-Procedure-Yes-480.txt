### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for Trickbot.
   - Trickbot connects to its Command and Control (C2) server to download and execute its payload.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Trickbot will then proceed to delete files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives as part of its impact tactics.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Trickbot's Typical Behavior:**
     - Trickbot is a modular banking trojan known for its ability to steal banking credentials, personal information, and other sensitive data.
     - It often uses C2 servers to download additional modules and execute various malicious activities.
   - **Impact Tactics:**
     - The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes impact tactics as actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction, network denial of service, or account lockout.
     - Deleting files with specific extensions on removable and network drives is a form of data destruction, which is an impact tactic.
   - **Trickbot's Known Impact Tactics:**
     - While Trickbot is primarily known for data theft and credential harvesting, it has been observed to engage in more destructive activities in some campaigns.
     - However, such destructive activities are not as common or typical as its primary data theft and persistence mechanisms.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While it is possible for Trickbot to engage in file deletion as part of its impact tactics, it is not a common or typical behavior for the malware.
   - The more common and typical behavior for Trickbot is to focus on data theft and maintaining persistence on the infected system.

### Final Answer: B: No
