### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor SWEED.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.
     - Employing defense evasion techniques such as software packing and deletion of the original file.
     - Collecting data from the local system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for Silent Code Execution:**
     - CVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows for remote code execution. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Employing Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - **Software Packing:** This technique involves compressing or encrypting the malicious code to avoid detection by antivirus software.
     - **Deletion of the Original File:** This is another defense evasion technique to remove traces of the initial infection vector.
   - **Collecting Data from the Local System:**
     - After gaining initial access and evading defenses, it is common for threat actors to collect data from the compromised system. This can include sensitive information, credentials, and other valuable data.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. Threat actors often follow a logical progression:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploit a vulnerability to gain entry.
     2. **Defense Evasion:** Use techniques to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
     3. **Data Collection:** Gather valuable information from the compromised system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression and the common TTPs used by threat actors, the sequence described is highly likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
