### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spear-phishing emails to deliver payloads through exploiting vulnerable Microsoft Office applications.
   - The question then asks if PKPLUG (a hypothetical threat actor or malware) is likely to achieve persistence by employing DLL side-loading before evading defenses by launching malicious payloads via legitimate signed applications.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing and Exploiting Vulnerable Applications:**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique (T1192 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
     - Exploiting vulnerable applications, such as Microsoft Office, is a common exploitation technique (T1203 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

   - **Achieving Persistence via DLL Side-Loading:**
     - DLL side-loading is a technique where a malicious DLL is loaded in place of a legitimate one, often to achieve persistence (T1574.002 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
     - This technique is plausible after gaining initial access and exploiting the vulnerable application.

   - **Evasion via Legitimate Signed Applications:**
     - Launching malicious payloads via legitimate signed applications is a common evasion technique (T1218 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
     - This technique is often used to avoid detection by security software.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with known attack patterns:
     - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails are used to deliver payloads.
     - **Exploitation:** The payloads exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office applications.
     - **Persistence:** DLL side-loading is used to maintain persistence.
     - **Evasion:** Malicious payloads are launched via legitimate signed applications to avoid detection.

   - Each step in the sequence is a well-documented and plausible technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
