### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Spear phishing activities targeting the ASEAN region.
     - Use of a decoy document for reconnaissance.
     - Exploitation of CVE-2012-0158.
     - Dropping of malicious components (wab.exe and wab32res.dll) for initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear Phishing:**
     - Spear phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails to specific individuals or organizations to gain unauthorized access.
     - This aligns with the first part of the question.

   - **Decoy Document for Reconnaissance:**
     - Using a decoy document to gather information (reconnaissance) is a plausible step in a targeted attack.
     - This aligns with the second part of the question.

   - **Exploitation of CVE-2012-0158:**
     - CVE-2012-0158 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
     - This vulnerability has been used in various spear phishing campaigns to drop malware.
     - This aligns with the third part of the question.

   - **Dropping Malicious Components (wab.exe and wab32res.dll):**
     - wab.exe and wab32res.dll are known to be used in malware campaigns to achieve initial access.
     - These components are often dropped by exploit kits or malware payloads.
     - This aligns with the fourth part of the question.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is plausible that the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components such as wab.exe and wab32res.dll for achieving initial access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
