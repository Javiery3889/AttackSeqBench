### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Deep Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gaining persistence through the Milestone backdoor.
     - Copying the backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
     - Creating a service named `msupdate2` directly in the registry.
   - The question then asks if Deep Panda is likely to use the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion, which employs Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) to protect malicious artifacts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - The persistence mechanism described (copying to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry) is a common technique used by various threat actors to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The use of a rootkit like Fire Chili, which employs DKOM, is a more advanced technique for defense evasion. DKOM involves modifying kernel objects to hide the presence of malicious processes, files, or network connections.
   - **Threat Actor Behavior:**
     - Deep Panda is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection. The use of a rootkit like Fire Chili aligns with the advanced capabilities of Deep Panda.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The described persistence mechanism (copying to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service) is a common and effective method to ensure the malware runs at system startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Given that Deep Panda is known for using advanced techniques, it is plausible that they would employ a rootkit like Fire Chili to further evade detection.
     - DKOM is a powerful technique that can effectively hide the presence of malicious artifacts, making it a logical choice for a sophisticated threat actor like Deep Panda.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - The combination of a common persistence mechanism and an advanced defense evasion technique (rootkit with DKOM) is consistent with the behavior of sophisticated threat actors like Deep Panda.
