### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the use of a dropper (disguised as a document or image) to execute Trojan.Vcrodat via spear-phishing emails for initial access.
   - It then asks if Whitefly is likely to exploit vulnerabilities and use Mimikatz for credential harvesting before compromising additional machines to escalate privileges.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with a dropper (disguised as a document or image) to execute Trojan.Vcrodat.
   - **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Credential Harvesting:** Using Mimikatz for credential harvesting.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Compromising additional machines.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Escalating privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing is a common method for initial access, and using a dropper to execute malware is a typical technique.
   - **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** After gaining initial access, attackers often look for vulnerabilities to exploit to gain deeper access or to move laterally within the network.
   - **Credential Harvesting:** Using tools like Mimikatz for credential harvesting is a common next step to gather credentials that can be used to access other systems.
   - **Lateral Movement:** With harvested credentials, attackers can compromise additional machines to spread their control.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Once additional machines are compromised, attackers often attempt to escalate their privileges to gain higher-level access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common attack pattern. It follows a typical progression of TTPs used by advanced threat actors.
   - Whitefly, as a sophisticated threat actor, is likely to follow such a sequence to achieve their objectives.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
