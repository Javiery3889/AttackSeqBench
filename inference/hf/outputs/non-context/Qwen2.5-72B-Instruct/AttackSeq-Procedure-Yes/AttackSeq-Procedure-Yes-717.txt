### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial reconnaissance phase where the attacker gathers system and network information.
   - It then asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 and exfiltrate data obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - Gathering system and network information (e.g., network adapter details, computer name, IP address) is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This is often part of the "Reconnaissance" phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Communication with Control Servers:**
     - Using an encrypted channel for communication with control servers is a common technique to avoid detection. RC4 is a stream cipher that has been used in various malware for encryption.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding is a common technique to make the data less recognizable and harder to detect. Base64 encoding is often used to encode binary data into a text format that can be transmitted over protocols that are designed to handle text.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - Initial reconnaissance is a standard first step in many cyber attacks.
     - Using RC4 for encrypted communication is a known technique used by various malware, including the Rising Sun implant.
     - Base64 encoding for data exfiltration is a common method to obfuscate data and avoid detection.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
