### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary uses a USB worm to infiltrate a target's internal network.
   - The question then asks if OnionDog, a specific malware, is likely to establish communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server and download additional malware for further operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **USB Worm Infiltration:**
     - A USB worm is a type of malware that spreads through removable media like USB drives. It can be used to bypass physical isolation and gain initial access to a network.
   - **OnionDog Trojan:**
     - OnionDog is a known malware that is often used in multi-stage attacks. It is designed to establish a secure and stealthy communication channel with a C&C server, often using the Tor network to obfuscate the communication.
   - **C&C Communication and Malware Download:**
     - Once a malware like OnionDog establishes a foothold in the network, it typically communicates with a C&C server to receive further instructions or to download additional malware for more advanced operations.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the initial infiltration was successful using a USB worm, it is plausible that the next step in the attack sequence would involve establishing a C&C communication.
   - OnionDog is known for its capabilities to establish such communication and to download additional malware.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that OnionDog would perform these actions to further the attack.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
