### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware WinDealer.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting data from SNS application folders and other targeted directories.
     - Processing the collected data into ".a" files and storing them in categorized directories.
     - Staging the data in the %TEMP% directory.
     - Encrypting the data.
     - Exfiltrating the data to a C2 server using communication channels over UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely to be performed by WinDealer.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely to be performed by WinDealer.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Data Collection and Processing:**
     - Collecting data from specific folders and processing it into ".a" files is a common TTP for malware, especially those designed for data exfiltration.
   - **Staging in %TEMP% Directory:**
     - Staging data in the %TEMP% directory is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection and to prepare data for exfiltration.
   - **Encryption:**
     - Encrypting data before exfiltration is a common practice to protect the data from being intercepted and to obfuscate the content.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Using specific communication channels (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556) for exfiltration is a plausible TTP, as malware often uses non-standard ports to avoid detection by network security systems.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the commonality and plausibility of each step in the described sequence, it is reasonable to conclude that WinDealer is likely to perform these actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
