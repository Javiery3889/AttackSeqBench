### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether attackers are likely to install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect the relevant data.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Discovery:** Attackers have already discovered systems, users, and data relevant to their mission.
     - **Lateral Movement:** The process of moving through the network to access additional systems and data.
     - **Persistence:** Techniques used to maintain access to the network over an extended period.
     - **Data Collection:** The process of gathering the relevant data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that attackers are likely to install further persistence points during lateral movement.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Strategic Advantage:** Installing persistence points during lateral movement can provide attackers with multiple backdoors and entry points, making it easier to maintain access and return to the network if their initial access is compromised.
       - **Operational Flexibility:** Persistence points can be used to stage further attacks, exfiltrate data, or pivot to other parts of the network.
       - **Resilience:** If one persistence point is discovered and removed, others can still be used to maintain access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that attackers are not likely to install further persistence points during lateral movement.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - **Immediate Objective:** If the primary goal is to collect data quickly, installing additional persistence points might be seen as an unnecessary step that could increase the risk of detection.
       - **Resource Constraints:** Attackers might have limited time or resources and focus on the immediate task of data collection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the strategic and operational advantages of installing persistence points during lateral movement, it is more likely that attackers would take this step to ensure they can maintain access and achieve their objectives.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
