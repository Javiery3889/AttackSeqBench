### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the A41APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader.
     - Performing software discovery using WMIC.
     - Heavily utilizing RDP for lateral movement to target additional servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Executing Fileless Implants via DLL Side-Loading using DESLoader:**
     - DLL side-loading is a technique where an attacker replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, causing the legitimate application to load and execute the malicious code.
     - DESLoader is a known tool used for this purpose, often associated with fileless malware.
   - **Performing Software Discovery using WMIC:**
     - WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is a powerful tool for querying and managing system information.
     - It is commonly used by attackers to gather information about the system, such as installed software, running processes, and network configurations.
   - **Heavily Utilizing RDP for Lateral Movement:**
     - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a common method for remote access to systems.
     - Attackers often use RDP to move laterally within a network, accessing additional systems and servers.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - **Step 1: Execute Fileless Implants via DLL Side-Loading using DESLoader:**
       - This is a common initial step to gain a foothold in the system without leaving traces on the disk.
     - **Step 2: Perform Software Discovery using WMIC:**
       - Once the initial foothold is established, the next logical step is to gather information about the system to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
     - **Step 3: Heavily Utilize RDP for Lateral Movement:**
       - After gathering information, the attacker would use RDP to move laterally to other systems, targeting additional servers and expanding their control within the network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns.
   - It is plausible that after executing fileless implants via DLL side-loading using DESLoader, the A41APT attackers would perform software discovery using WMIC before heavily utilizing RDP for lateral movement.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
