### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails exploiting specific vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352).
   - After gaining initial access, the question asks if Dropping Elephant (a known threat actor) is likely to use a UPX packed backdoor to download PowerShell command line scripts for execution.
   - Finally, it asks if they are likely to employ encoded blobs for defense evasion techniques.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a common initial access vector used by many threat actors, including Dropping Elephant.
     - Exploiting specific vulnerabilities like CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352 is also a plausible method for gaining initial access.
   - **Use of UPX Packed Backdoor:**
     - UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) is a popular tool used to pack executables to make them smaller and harder to analyze. It is commonly used by threat actors to evade detection.
     - Dropping Elephant has been known to use packed backdoors to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Downloading PowerShell Scripts:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to execute commands and scripts on Windows systems. It is often used by threat actors for various malicious activities, including downloading and executing additional payloads.
     - Dropping Elephant has been observed using PowerShell scripts to download and execute additional payloads.
   - **Encoded Blobs for Defense Evasion:**
     - Encoded blobs are a technique used to obfuscate data and evade detection by security tools. This is a common defense evasion technique used by many threat actors.
     - Dropping Elephant has been known to use various obfuscation techniques, including encoded blobs, to evade detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Dropping Elephant, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is that Dropping Elephant would use a UPX packed backdoor to download PowerShell command line scripts for execution and employ encoded blobs for defense evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
