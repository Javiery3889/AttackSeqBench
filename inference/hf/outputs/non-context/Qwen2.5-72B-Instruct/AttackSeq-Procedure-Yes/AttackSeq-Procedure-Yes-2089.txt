### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Credential Access:** Attackers obtained domain administrative credentials.
     - **Discovery:** Attackers used these credentials to compromise additional endpoints.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before using the Domain Administrator account.
     - This is plausible because:
       - Attackers often seek to escalate their privileges gradually to avoid detection.
       - Finding and using admin-level credentials can provide a stepping stone to eventually compromise the Domain Administrator account.
       - This approach allows attackers to maintain a low profile and reduce the risk of being detected by security systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers did not aim to find admin-level credentials before using the Domain Administrator account.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - Directly using the Domain Administrator account without intermediate steps can be riskier and more likely to trigger alerts.
       - Attackers typically prefer a more controlled and gradual approach to privilege escalation.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
