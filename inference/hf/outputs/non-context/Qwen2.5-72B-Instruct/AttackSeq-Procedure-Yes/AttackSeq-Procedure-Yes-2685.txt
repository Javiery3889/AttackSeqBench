### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elfin threat group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Scanning for vulnerable websites to identify targets or create C&C infrastructure.
     2. Exploiting CVE-2018-20250.
     3. Delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails.
     4. Deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill for execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Scanning for Vulnerable Websites:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to identify potential targets or to set up command and control (C&C) infrastructure.
   - **Exploiting CVE-2018-20250:**
     - CVE-2018-20250 is a specific vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application framework. Exploiting this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
   - **Delivering the Exploit via Spear-Phishing Emails:**
     - Spear-phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers send emails to specific individuals or organizations to trick them into clicking on a malicious link or attachment. However, exploiting CVE-2018-20250 typically involves targeting web applications, not email clients.
   - **Deploying Malware Tools:**
     - Once a foothold is established, deploying malware tools like Notestuk and Stonedrill is a common next step to maintain persistence and further compromise the target.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not entirely plausible because:
     - Exploiting CVE-2018-20250 is typically done by targeting web applications, not by delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails. Spear-phishing is more commonly used to deliver other types of malware, such as trojans or ransomware, which can then be used to gain initial access to a network.
     - The sequence suggests a mix of web application exploitation and social engineering, which are two different attack vectors. While both can be used in a multi-stage attack, they are not typically combined in the way described.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
