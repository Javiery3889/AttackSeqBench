### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Naikon APT group using specific TTPs.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Establishing persistence using the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
     - Executing the Aria-body loader's tasks, which include:
       - Injecting into processes.
       - Decrypting configuration data.
       - Contacting C&C servers.
     - Gathering network-related information like TCP and UDP table status through the Aria-body backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - The 'Startup' folder and 'Run' registry key are common methods for establishing persistence. These techniques are well-documented and frequently used by various APT groups, including Naikon.
   - **Executing Aria-body Loader Tasks:**
     - Injecting into processes, decrypting configuration data, and contacting C&C servers are typical actions performed by loaders and backdoors. The Aria-body loader is known to perform these tasks.
   - **Gathering Network-Related Information:**
     - Gathering network-related information such as TCP and UDP table status is a common post-compromise activity to understand the network environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation. This is a logical step after establishing a foothold and setting up communication with the C&C server.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - Naikon APT group is known to use various persistence mechanisms, and the 'Startup' folder and 'Run' registry key are common and effective methods.
   - **Loader Tasks:**
     - The Aria-body loader is a known component of Naikon's toolkit. It is designed to perform tasks such as injecting into processes, decrypting configuration data, and establishing C&C communication.
   - **Network Information Gathering:**
     - After gaining persistence and setting up communication with the C&C server, it is logical for the APT group to gather network-related information to understand the environment and plan further actions.

### Final Answer
Given the known TTPs of the Naikon APT group and the logical sequence of actions described, it is likely that they will follow this sequence of TTPs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
