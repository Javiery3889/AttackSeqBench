### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Tropic Trooper.
   - The initial access was gained through the exploitation of either CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) was dropped before a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) was used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 are both vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This is a common initial access vector for many APT groups, including Tropic Trooper.
   - **Backdoor Installer (UserInstall.exe):**
     - Dropping a backdoor installer is a common next step after gaining initial access. This installer would typically be used to establish persistence and ensure that the attacker can maintain access to the system.
   - **Malicious DLL Loader (wab32res.dll):**
     - A malicious DLL loader is often used to load and execute additional payloads, such as a DLL backdoor. This step is typically performed after the initial backdoor is installed to maintain stealth and persistence.
   - **DLL Injection into dllhost.exe:**
     - DLL injection is a technique used to run arbitrary code within the context of another process. This is often done to evade detection and maintain persistence. It is a common technique used after the initial backdoor is established.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common TTPs used by APT groups:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) to gain initial access.
     2. **Persistence:** Drop a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) to establish persistence.
     3. **Payload Execution:** Use a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to load and execute additional payloads.
     4. **Stealth and Persistence:** Inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to maintain stealth and persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
