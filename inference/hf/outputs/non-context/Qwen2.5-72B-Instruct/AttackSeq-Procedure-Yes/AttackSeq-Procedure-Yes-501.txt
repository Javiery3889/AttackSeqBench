### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SombRAT backdoor in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Defense evasion techniques (process injection, deobfuscation)
     - Process discovery
     - System time discovery
     - Archiving collected data using a custom storage file format

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - Process injection and deobfuscation are common techniques used to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Process Discovery:**
     - After evading defenses, it is logical for the malware to discover running processes to understand the environment and identify potential targets or threats.
   - **System Time Discovery:**
     - Discovering the system time can help the malware determine the best time to perform certain actions, such as exfiltrating data or avoiding detection during certain hours.
   - **Archiving Collected Data:**
     - Once the malware has gathered the necessary information, it will likely archive the data to prepare for exfiltration.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Phase:**
     - The malware uses process injection and deobfuscation to evade detection and establish a foothold in the system.
   - **Environmental Reconnaissance:**
     - After evading defenses, the malware performs process discovery to understand the running processes and system environment.
   - **Timing and Synchronization:**
     - The malware then discovers the system time to synchronize its actions and avoid detection.
   - **Data Collection and Preparation:**
     - Finally, the malware archives the collected data using a custom storage file format to prepare for exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of TTPs described, it is likely that the SombRAT malware will employ its process discovery and system time discovery capabilities before archiving collected data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
