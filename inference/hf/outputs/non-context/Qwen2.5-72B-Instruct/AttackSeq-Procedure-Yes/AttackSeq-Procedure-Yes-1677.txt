### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with the WastedLocker ransomware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Deployment using PsExec:** This is a common technique for lateral movement and remote execution.
     - **Stopping services and disabling Windows Defender:** These actions are part of the **Defense Evasion** phase, where the attacker tries to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
     - **Encrypting computers and servers:** This is the primary goal of ransomware, which occurs in the **Impact** phase.
     - **Demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom:** This is the final step in the ransomware attack, where the attacker seeks financial gain.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely to occur.
     - The sequence aligns with the typical behavior of ransomware like WastedLocker:
       - **Deployment using PsExec:** WastedLocker is known to use PsExec for lateral movement and remote execution.
       - **Stopping services and disabling Windows Defender:** These actions are common in the Defense Evasion phase to ensure the ransomware can run without interference.
       - **Encrypting computers and servers:** This is the primary function of ransomware, and WastedLocker is designed to encrypt files to cause disruption.
       - **Demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom:** Ransomware attacks often demand large ransoms, and WastedLocker is known for targeting high-value victims and demanding significant sums.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely to occur.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - The sequence described is consistent with known WastedLocker behavior.
       - There is no reason to believe that WastedLocker would not follow through with encryption and ransom demands after successfully evading defenses.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
