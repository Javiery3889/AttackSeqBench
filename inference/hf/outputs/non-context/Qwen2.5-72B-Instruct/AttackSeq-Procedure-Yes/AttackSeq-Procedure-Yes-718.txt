### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Rising Sun implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial reconnaissance: Decrypting and collecting network and system information.
     - Communication with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after performing initial reconnaissance, the Rising Sun implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
     - This is a common sequence in many cyber attacks. After gathering initial information, malware often needs to exfiltrate this data and receive further commands from the attacker.
     - HTTP POST requests are a common method for command and control (C2) communication because they can blend in with normal web traffic, making them less likely to be detected by network security systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant would not communicate with control servers via HTTP POST requests.
     - This is less likely because most advanced malware, including the Rising Sun implant, typically needs to communicate with a control server to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common TTPs in cyber attacks and the typical behavior of malware, it is highly likely that the Rising Sun implant would communicate with control servers via HTTP POST requests after performing initial reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
