### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the FAKEM RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Disguising network traffic to look like legitimate protocols (Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger).
     - Using encrypted network communication.
     - Employing XOR operations for encryption during command and control (C2) activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Disguising Network Traffic:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection by blending in with legitimate traffic. It is often referred to as "protocol impersonation" or "traffic obfuscation."
   - **Encrypted Network Communication:**
     - Encrypting network communication is a standard practice in malware to protect the C2 channel from being intercepted and analyzed. This helps in maintaining the secrecy of the communication.
   - **XOR Operations for Encryption:**
     - XOR is a simple and lightweight encryption technique that can be used to obfuscate data. While it is not as secure as more advanced encryption algorithms, it is often used in malware due to its simplicity and effectiveness in basic obfuscation.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the FAKEM RAT controller will indeed use encrypted network communication, including XOR operations, for C2 activities.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the FAKEM RAT controller will not use encrypted network communication, including XOR operations, for C2 activities.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the question, it is highly plausible that the FAKEM RAT controller would use encrypted network communication to protect the C2 channel. XOR operations are a common and simple method for basic encryption and obfuscation.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the FAKEM RAT controller will use encrypted network communication, including XOR operations, for C2 activities.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
