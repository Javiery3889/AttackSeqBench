### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the Volatile Cedar campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using initially infected servers as a pivot.
     - Manually spreading across the entire network.
     - Infecting USB devices for lateral movement.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the campaign will leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control (C2) operations through application layer protocols.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Volatile Cedar campaign will use a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations.
     - Multi-tiered server backend frameworks are often used in sophisticated campaigns to maintain robust and resilient C2 infrastructure.
     - Application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) are commonly used for C2 communications to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.
     - Given the manual spreading and use of USB devices, the campaign appears to be sophisticated and well-planned, which aligns with the use of advanced C2 techniques.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Volatile Cedar campaign will not use a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations.
     - This would imply a less sophisticated approach, which seems less likely given the described TTPs.
     - The use of initially infected servers as a pivot and manual spreading across the network indicates a level of sophistication that would benefit from a robust C2 infrastructure.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the described TTPs and the sophistication of the campaign, it is more likely that the Volatile Cedar campaign will leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations through application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
