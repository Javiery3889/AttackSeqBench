### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the BlackSoul malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:** BlackSoul communicates with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding.
     - **Exfiltration:** The question asks if it is likely that BlackSoul will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - The use of RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding for C2 communication is a common technique used by malware to maintain a low profile and blend in with normal web traffic.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Once a malware establishes a C2 channel, it often uses this channel to exfiltrate data. This is a logical next step in the attack lifecycle.
     - Automated exfiltration is a technique where the malware automatically sends data to the C2 server without requiring manual intervention, which is efficient and reduces the risk of detection.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that BlackSoul has already established a C2 channel using a common and stealthy protocol, it is highly likely that the next step would be to exfiltrate data over this channel.
   - Automated exfiltration is a common and efficient method for malware to send stolen data back to the attacker.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
