### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the NanHaiShu malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Gathering system information from the infected machine.
     2. Uploading the gathered information to the C&C (Command and Control) server.
     3. Using dynamic DNS providers to communicate with the C&C server.
     4. Switching from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - NanHaiShu is known to use dynamic DNS providers to maintain communication with C&C servers, which can help in evading detection and maintaining persistence.
     - Switching from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address is a plausible tactic to avoid geolocation-based detection and to potentially leverage infrastructure in a region where the attackers have more control or less risk of being traced.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - However, given the known behavior of NanHaiShu and the common use of dynamic DNS and IP switching in advanced persistent threats (APTs), this choice is less plausible.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the behavior of NanHaiShu and the tactics commonly used in APTs.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is that the malware will indeed use dynamic DNS providers to communicate with C&C servers and switch from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
