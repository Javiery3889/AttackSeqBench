### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT10 has already gained higher-level permissions (domain administrator) using compromised Managed Service Provider (MSP) credentials.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT10 will use tools like Mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping by employing DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT10 TTPs:**
     - APT10 is known for using a variety of techniques to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. One of their common tactics is to use credential dumping to gain additional access and move laterally within a network.
     - Tools like Mimikatz and PwDump are frequently used by APT10 for credential dumping.
   - **DLL Load Order Hijacking:**
     - DLL load order hijacking is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a location that is searched before the legitimate DLL, causing the system to load the malicious DLL instead.
     - This technique can be used to gain code execution and potentially access sensitive information, including credentials.
   - **Context of the Question:**
     - Given that APT10 has already gained domain administrator permissions, they have the necessary access to perform credential dumping.
     - Using DLL load order hijacking to deploy tools like Mimikatz or PwDump is a plausible method to further compromise the domain controller and extract additional credentials.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known TTPs of APT10 and the context of the question, it is likely that APT10 will use tools like Mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping by employing DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
