### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Scote malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Backdoor Access:** Scote malware provides backdoor access.
     - **C2 Information Collection:** The malware collects C2 (Command and Control) information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers used Arabic language decoy documents to entice victims as part of their phishing strategy during the initial access phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Backdoor Access and C2 Information Collection:**
     - These are typical TTPs used in the post-compromise phase of an attack. The malware has already gained access to the system and is now setting up communication channels with the attackers.
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The initial access phase typically involves techniques to gain the initial foothold in the target environment. Common techniques include phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and using social engineering.
   - **Arabic Language Decoy Documents:**
     - Using decoy documents in a specific language (Arabic in this case) is a common technique in phishing attacks. Attackers often tailor their phishing emails and documents to the language and cultural context of their targets to increase the likelihood of success.
   - **Phishing Strategy:**
     - Phishing is a common initial access technique. If the attackers are targeting victims who are likely to be familiar with Arabic, using Arabic language decoy documents would be a plausible strategy.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the use of decoy documents in the target's language is a common and effective phishing technique, and considering that the question does not provide any information that contradicts this, it is reasonable to conclude that the attackers likely used Arabic language decoy documents to entice victims during the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
