### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dexphot malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks.**
     - **Techniques used: Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution.**
   - The question then asks if Dexphot is likely to use **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader** to obfuscate its files or information as part of its defense evasion tactics.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Techniques:**
     - **Scheduled Task:** This technique is used to ensure that the malware runs at specific intervals or upon certain system events.
     - **Signed Binary Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using legitimate, signed binaries to execute malicious code, which can help evade detection by security software.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - **Obfuscation:** Malware often uses obfuscation to hide its presence and behavior from security tools and analysts.
     - **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader:** This is a specific type of malware that is known to bundle and load other malware, often using obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Dexphot's Behavior:**
     - Dexphot is known for its sophisticated persistence mechanisms and defense evasion techniques.
     - It has been observed using various obfuscation methods to hide its files and network traffic.
   - **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader:**
     - This malware is known for bundling and loading other malware, which aligns with the idea of using it to obfuscate Dexphot's files or information.
     - However, the specific mention of **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader** in the context of Dexphot is not a well-documented or common association in CTI reports.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - While Dexphot does use obfuscation as part of its defense evasion tactics, the specific use of **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader** is not a well-documented or typical behavior for Dexphot.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that Dexphot would use **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader** for this purpose.

### Final Answer: B: No
