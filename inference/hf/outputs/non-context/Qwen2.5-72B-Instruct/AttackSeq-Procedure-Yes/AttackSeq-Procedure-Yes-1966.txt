### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that the StellarParticle threat actor might use.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Accessing data from Information Repositories during the Collection phase.
     2. Using privileged and non-privileged accounts through RDP for Lateral Movement.
     3. Configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence in the Persistence phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The threat actor accesses data from Information Repositories. This is a common step in the Collection phase where the attacker gathers sensitive information.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The threat actor uses privileged and non-privileged accounts through RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for Lateral Movement. This is a plausible next step after collecting data, as the attacker might need to move to other systems to further their objectives.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The threat actor configures TrailBlazer malware for WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) persistence. This is a common technique used to maintain long-term access to the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Collection:** The attacker gathers data from the compromised system.
     2. **Lateral Movement:** The attacker uses RDP to move to other systems, which is a common technique for expanding the attack footprint.
     3. **Persistence:** The attacker configures malware for persistence to ensure they can maintain access over time.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with typical attack patterns observed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
