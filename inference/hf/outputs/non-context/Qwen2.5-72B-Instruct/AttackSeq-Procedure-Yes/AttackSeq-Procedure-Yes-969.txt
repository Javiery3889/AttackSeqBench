### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Aria-body backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
     - Injecting itself into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe'.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will gather information about the victim's machine, including details of the installed software and Windows version for discovery purposes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547):** The backdoor achieves persistence by adding itself to the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key. This ensures that the backdoor runs every time the system starts.
   - **Process Injection (T1055):** The backdoor injects itself into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe'. This technique is used to execute code in the context of another process, often to evade detection.
   - **Discovery (T1082, T1016, T1047):** After gaining persistence and injecting itself, it is common for malware to gather information about the victim's machine. This includes:
     - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** Gathering details about the operating system and hardware.
     - **System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016):** Gathering information about network configurations.
     - **Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047):** Using WMI to gather detailed information about the system.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the Aria-body backdoor will gather information about the victim's machine. This is a common next step after achieving persistence and process injection, as the malware needs to understand the environment it is operating in to perform further actions, such as exfiltrating data or establishing a command and control (C2) channel.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
