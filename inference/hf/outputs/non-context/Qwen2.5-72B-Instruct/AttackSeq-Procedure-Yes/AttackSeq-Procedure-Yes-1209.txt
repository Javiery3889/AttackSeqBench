### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the PyFlash backdoor.
   - PyFlash gathers OS-related information and sends it to a C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that both NetFlash and PyFlash will use specific ports (80, 8,000, and 15,363) for encrypted network communication with their respective C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Port 80:** This is a well-known port for HTTP traffic. It is commonly used for web browsing and is often not blocked by firewalls. However, it is less common for C&C communication because it is easily detectable and can be monitored by security systems.
   - **Port 8,000:** This is a non-standard port and could be used for C&C communication to avoid detection. However, it is not as common as other ports like 443 (HTTPS).
   - **Port 15,363:** This is a very specific and non-standard port. It is less likely to be used for C&C communication because it is not commonly associated with any standard services and might raise suspicion.
   - **Encrypted Network Traffic:** Using encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS on port 443) is a common technique to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality of C&C communications. However, the question specifically mentions ports 80, 8,000, and 15,363, which are not typically associated with encrypted traffic.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - While it is possible for malware to use any port for communication, the specific ports mentioned (80, 8,000, and 15,363) are not the most common or stealthy choices for C&C communication, especially when encrypted traffic is involved.
   - Port 80 is often used for unencrypted HTTP traffic, and using it for encrypted C&C communication would be unusual.
   - Port 8,000 is non-standard and might raise suspicion.
   - Port 15,363 is very specific and not commonly used, which could also raise suspicion.
   - Given the nature of C&C communication, it is more likely that malware would use a more common and less suspicious port, such as 443 for HTTPS.

### Final Answer:
B: No
