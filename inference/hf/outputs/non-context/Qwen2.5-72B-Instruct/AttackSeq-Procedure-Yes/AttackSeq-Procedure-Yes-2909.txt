### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors have executed malicious code using the AtomBombing technique.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that these threat actors will use this capability to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

2. **Understand the AtomBombing Technique:**
   - **AtomBombing** is a code injection technique that leverages the Windows atom tables to execute arbitrary code in the context of a target process. This technique is often used to bypass security mechanisms and execute code in a way that is difficult to detect.

3. **Evaluate the Purpose of Code Injection:**
   - The primary goal of code injection techniques, including AtomBombing, is to execute malicious code within the context of a trusted process. This is done to:
     - **Bypass Process-Level Restrictions:** Trusted processes often have higher privileges and are less likely to be restricted by security policies.
     - **Evade Security Products:** Security products are more likely to trust and allow the execution of code within trusted processes, making it easier for the malicious code to operate undetected.

4. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that threat actors will use the AtomBombing technique to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.
     - This aligns with the known purposes and capabilities of the AtomBombing technique.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that threat actors will use the AtomBombing technique for these purposes.
     - This does not align with the known purposes and capabilities of the AtomBombing technique.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that threat actors will use the AtomBombing technique to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
