### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CopyKittens group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Configuring a Reflective Loader to survive reboots and process exits.
     - Establishing DNS Command and Control (C2) communication.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group will proceed to steal Outlook passwords as part of acquiring credentials from password stores.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reflective Loader Configuration:**
     - A Reflective Loader is a technique used to load a malicious payload directly into memory, often to avoid detection by security software. Configuring it to survive reboots and process exits indicates a desire for persistence.
   - **DNS Command and Control:**
     - DNS C2 is a method where the attacker uses DNS queries to communicate with the compromised system. This is a common technique for maintaining control over the infected host.
   - **Stealing Outlook Passwords:**
     - Stealing Outlook passwords is a common tactic used by attackers to gain access to email accounts, which can provide valuable information and further access to the network.

3. **Evaluate the Likelihood:**
   - **Persistence and C2:**
     - The initial steps of configuring the Reflective Loader and establishing DNS C2 suggest that the attacker is setting up a long-term presence on the compromised system.
   - **Credential Harvesting:**
     - Once the attacker has established persistence and C2, it is common for them to proceed with credential harvesting to gain further access and control. Outlook passwords are a valuable target because they can provide access to email, which is often a rich source of sensitive information.
   - **CopyKittens Group:**
     - The CopyKittens group is known for conducting sophisticated cyber espionage campaigns. They often target credentials and sensitive information as part of their operations.

### Final Answer:
Given the sequence of TTPs described and the known behavior of the CopyKittens group, it is likely that they will proceed to steal Outlook passwords as part of acquiring credentials from password stores.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
