### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by an app on an iOS device.
   - The app collects various types of data (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data).
   - The app performs routines on the device.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the app will send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP for Data Exfiltration:**
     - HTTP is a common protocol used for data exfiltration because it is often allowed through firewalls and can blend in with normal web traffic.
     - It is a lightweight and efficient method for sending small to medium-sized data payloads.
   - **FTP for File Uploads:**
     - FTP is a protocol used for transferring files over a network.
     - It is often used for uploading larger files or multiple files.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Operations:**
     - C2 operations typically involve the app communicating with a remote server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - The sequence of using HTTP for initial data exfiltration and then FTP for file uploads is plausible because it allows for efficient and flexible data transfer.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common use of HTTP for initial data exfiltration and FTP for file uploads in C2 operations, the sequence described in the question is plausible.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is that the app will send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
