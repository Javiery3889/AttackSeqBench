### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Poison Ivy server is delivered via social engineering methods.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use the Camellia cipher for encrypted communications during the Command and Control (C2) phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Social engineering methods are used to deliver the Poison Ivy server.
   - **Execution:** The Poison Ivy server is executed on the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The malware establishes communication with the attacker's client.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Poison Ivy is a well-known Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that has been extensively studied.
     - Poison Ivy typically uses a custom encryption algorithm for its C2 communications, not the Camellia cipher.
     - The Camellia cipher is a symmetric key block cipher, but it is not commonly associated with Poison Ivy's C2 communications.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - As mentioned, Poison Ivy uses a custom encryption algorithm for its C2 communications.
     - The use of the Camellia cipher is not a known characteristic of Poison Ivy's C2 communications.
     - Therefore, it is unlikely that Poison Ivy would use the Camellia cipher for encrypted communications.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that Poison Ivy is unlikely to use the Camellia cipher for encrypted communications during the C2 phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
