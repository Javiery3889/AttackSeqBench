### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that Regin, a sophisticated malware, might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Discovering information on processes and memory utilization.
     - Scanning for deleted files.
     - Monitoring network traffic to Microsoft IIS web servers.
     - Crawling through the file system and gathering computer information.
     - Encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data during exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is plausible for Regin.
     - Regin is known for its sophisticated and multi-stage attack capabilities. It often involves reconnaissance, data collection, and exfiltration.
     - The sequence described fits well with Regin's known behavior:
       - **Reconnaissance:** Discovering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, and monitoring network traffic.
       - **Collection:** Crawling through the file system and gathering computer information.
       - **Exfiltration:** Encoding and embedding payload information within cookie data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not plausible for Regin.
     - However, given Regin's known capabilities and the detailed sequence described, this choice seems less likely.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described is consistent with Regin's known behavior and capabilities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
