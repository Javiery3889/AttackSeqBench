### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing command and control (C&C) communication using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6).
     - Polling remote C&C servers for tasks and executing commands.
     - Deploying Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm.
     - Leaving ransom notes in encrypted directories.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing C&C Communication:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where the attacker establishes a communication channel to control the compromised system.
   - **Polling C&C Servers for Tasks and Executing Commands:**
     - Once the C&C communication is established, the malware can receive and execute commands from the attacker.
   - **Deploying Hermes Ransomware:**
     - Hermes ransomware is known to be used by the Lazarus group. It encrypts files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm, which is a strong encryption method.
   - **Leaving Ransom Notes:**
     - After encrypting files, ransomware typically leaves ransom notes in the encrypted directories to inform the victim about the ransom and how to pay.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the Lazarus group.
   - The use of backdoor malware to establish C&C communication, followed by the deployment of Hermes ransomware, and the leaving of ransom notes, aligns with the group's known activities.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
