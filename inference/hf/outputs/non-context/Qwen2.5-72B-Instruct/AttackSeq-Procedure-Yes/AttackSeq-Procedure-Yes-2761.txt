### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has compromised the UEFI firmware and tampered with the CORE_DXE component to gain execution.
   - The question then asks whether MoonBounce, a known malware, is likely to operate entirely in memory to evade detection before moving laterally within the network.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - MoonBounce is known for its sophisticated techniques to evade detection. Operating entirely in memory (in-memory execution) is a common tactic used by advanced malware to avoid leaving traces on the disk, which can help evade detection by traditional security tools.
     - Given that the initial compromise involves a UEFI firmware-level attack, which is highly stealthy and persistent, it is plausible that MoonBoice would continue to use advanced evasion techniques, including in-memory execution, to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If MoonBounce were to operate partially or entirely on disk, it would be more detectable by security tools. However, the question implies that the attacker is already using highly sophisticated techniques (UEFI firmware compromise) to gain a foothold, which suggests a high level of sophistication and a focus on stealth.
     - Given the nature of the initial compromise, it is less likely that MoonBounce would abandon in-memory execution, which is a key technique for maintaining stealth.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that MoonBounce would operate entirely in memory to evade detection before gaining lateral movement within the network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
