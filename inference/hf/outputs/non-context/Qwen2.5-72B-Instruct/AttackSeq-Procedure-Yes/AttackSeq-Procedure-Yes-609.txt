### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     - Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     - Abusing command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
     - Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts is a common initial reconnaissance technique.
     - Exploiting exposed Docker API ports is a known method to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Execution of Cryptocurrency Mining Scripts:**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often use command interpreters to execute scripts, including cryptocurrency mining scripts. This is a common post-exploitation technique to monetize the compromised system.
   - **Resource Hijacking:**
     - The ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images aligns with the goal of using the compromised system for unauthorized purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a typical attack pattern:
     - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
       - Scanning for misconfigured hosts and exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     - **Post-Exploitation:**
       - Using command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
     - **Achieving the Objective:**
       - Deploying malicious container images to hijack resources for cryptocurrency mining.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
