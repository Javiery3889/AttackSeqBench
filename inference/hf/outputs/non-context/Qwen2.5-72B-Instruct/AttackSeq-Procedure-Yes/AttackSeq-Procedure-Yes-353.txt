### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by threat actors.
   - The sequence is: T1553 Subvert Trust Controls → T1057 Process Discovery → T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is plausible.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not plausible.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls:**
     - This technique involves manipulating or subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access or to evade security mechanisms. Examples include modifying security settings, bypassing authentication, or exploiting trusted relationships.
   - **T1057 Process Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system. This information can be used to understand the system's configuration, identify potential targets, and plan further actions.
   - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with command and control (C2) servers. This can help the threat actors maintain control over the compromised infrastructure.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls:**
     - After subverting trust controls, the threat actors have gained a foothold in the system and can now perform further actions without being detected by security mechanisms.
   - **T1057 Process Discovery:**
     - Once the threat actors have access, it is logical for them to gather information about the system to understand its configuration and identify potential targets. This step is crucial for planning further actions and ensuring they can move laterally within the network.
   - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol:**
     - After gaining knowledge about the system and identifying potential targets, the threat actors can set up command and control (C2) communication using standard application layer protocols. This allows them to maintain control over the compromised infrastructure and execute further commands.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs (T1553 → T1057 → T1071) is logically consistent and aligns with common attack patterns. Subverting trust controls to gain access, discovering processes to understand the system, and then setting up C2 communication using application layer protocols is a plausible and often observed sequence in cyber attacks.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
