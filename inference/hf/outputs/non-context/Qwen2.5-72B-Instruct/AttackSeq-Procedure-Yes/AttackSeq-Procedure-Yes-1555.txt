### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT42.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Internal Reconnaissance:** Accessing user contacts and extracting system and network information.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.
     - **Spear-Phishing:** Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets leveraging the victim’s trusted relationships.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. APT42, like many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, would likely gather information about the network and users to plan further actions.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts is a plausible method for lateral movement. APT42 might leverage the trust associated with personal accounts to gain access to corporate systems.
   - **Spear-Phishing:**
     - Once the attacker has access to corporate accounts, they can use the victim’s trusted relationships to send spear-phishing emails to additional targets. This is a common technique to expand the attack and gain deeper access into the network.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and aligns with the known TTPs of APT42. The steps of internal reconnaissance, lateral movement, and spear-phishing are all plausible and often used in coordinated cyber attacks.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
