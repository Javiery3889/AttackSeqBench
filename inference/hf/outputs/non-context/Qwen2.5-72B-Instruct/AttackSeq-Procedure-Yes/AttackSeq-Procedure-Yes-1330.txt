### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Spear phishing emails delivering LODEINFO malware via Office macro files.
     - Malware injecting malicious code into the `svchost.exe` process.
     - Adding values to the Run registry for persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear Phishing and LODEINFO Malware:**
     - Spear phishing is a common initial access technique (T1192) where attackers send targeted emails to victims to trick them into opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links.
     - LODEINFO is a known malware that can be delivered via Office macro files, which is a common technique (T1204.002) for initial infection.

   - **Injecting Malicious Code into `svchost.exe`:**
     - Injecting code into the `svchost.exe` process is a technique used for process injection (T1055). This is often done to hide the presence of the malware and to execute malicious code in the context of a legitimate process.

   - **Adding Values to the Run Registry for Persistence:**
     - Adding values to the Run registry key (T1060) is a common persistence technique. This ensures that the malware is executed every time the system starts.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical order:
     - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access through spear phishing.
     - **Execution:** The malware is executed via the Office macro.
     - **Process Injection:** The malware injects code into `svchost.exe` to hide its presence and execute malicious code.
     - **Persistence:** The malware adds values to the Run registry to ensure it persists across system reboots.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is a common and logical sequence used by attackers. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will inject malicious code into the `svchost.exe` process before adding values to the Run registry for persistence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
