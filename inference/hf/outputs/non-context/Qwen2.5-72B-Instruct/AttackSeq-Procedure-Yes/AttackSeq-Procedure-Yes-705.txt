### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
   - After gaining access, the attacker executes Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TA505 will store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
     - The SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) is a known vulnerability that can be exploited to gain initial access to a system.
     - Using Cobalt Strike Beacon with Base64 encoded PowerShell commands is a common technique for executing payloads and maintaining persistence while evading detection.

   - **TA505 and FlawedGrace RAT:**
     - TA505 is a well-known threat actor that has been associated with various malware campaigns, including the use of the FlawedGrace RAT.
     - FlawedGrace is a remote access trojan (RAT) that has been used by TA505 in several campaigns.

   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - Base64 encoding is a common technique used to obfuscate data and evade detection by security tools.
     - Storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings would align with TA505's known tactics for defense evasion.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) to gain initial access is a plausible and documented method.
   - **Execution of Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - Executing Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands is a common and effective technique for maintaining persistence and evading detection.
   - **Use of FlawedGrace RAT:**
     - TA505 has a history of using FlawedGrace RAT in their campaigns.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings is a logical step for defense evasion, as it helps to avoid detection by security tools.
