### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the behavior of APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear) after executing malware like GAMEFISH through spear-phishing exploit documents.
   - Specifically, it inquires whether APT28 is likely to leverage legitimate tools already present in the victim's systems for lateral movement, rather than using their traditional toolset.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Spear-phishing exploit documents to execute malware (GAMEFISH).
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using legitimate tools already present in the victim's systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT28 TTPs:**
     - APT28 is known for using a variety of techniques to maintain persistence and move laterally within a network.
     - They often use both custom malware and legitimate tools to achieve their objectives.
     - Legitimate tools (e.g., PowerShell, WMI, PsExec) are frequently used to blend in with normal network traffic and evade detection.
   - **Leveraging Legitimate Tools:**
     - Using legitimate tools is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Defense Evasion" and "Lateral Movement" tactics.
     - This approach helps APT28 avoid detection by security systems that might flag custom malware more easily.
   - **Traditional Toolset:**
     - APT28 has a well-documented set of tools and techniques, but they are also known to adapt and use legitimate tools to stay under the radar.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given APT28's known behavior and the benefits of using legitimate tools for evasion, it is highly likely that they would leverage legitimate tools already present in the victim's systems for lateral movement.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
