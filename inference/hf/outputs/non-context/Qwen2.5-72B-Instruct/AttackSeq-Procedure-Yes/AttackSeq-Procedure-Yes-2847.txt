### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Asruex malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing a PowerShell command to download and execute a batch file.
     - Detecting anti-virus software to evade detection.
     - Retrieving an image file with encoded malware from the C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Decoding and executing the malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Asruex malware is likely to detect anti-virus software to evade detection before retrieving the image file.
     - This is a plausible sequence because malware often includes anti-detection mechanisms to avoid being caught by security software. Detecting anti-virus software is a common technique used by malware to ensure it can operate without being detected.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Asruex malware is not likely to detect anti-virus software before retrieving the image file.
     - This is less plausible because it would be unusual for malware to skip such an important step in its evasion strategy.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Asruex malware would detect anti-virus software to evade detection before retrieving the image file with encoded malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
