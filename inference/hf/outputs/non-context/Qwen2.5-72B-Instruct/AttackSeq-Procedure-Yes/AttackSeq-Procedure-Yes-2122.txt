### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the A41APT campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Activities:**
       - Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports using WMIC.
       - Deploying tools to uncover domain accounts.
     - **Lateral Movement:**
       - Utilizing RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports using WMIC is a common technique for discovering potential entry points and vulnerabilities within a network.
     - Deploying tools to uncover domain accounts is another common discovery technique to gather information about the network and potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a widely used protocol for remote access to systems, making it a common target for lateral movement.
     - After discovering open RDP ports and domain accounts, it is logical for an attacker to use RDP to move laterally within the network, especially targeting servers which often have more critical data and higher privileges.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the A41APT campaign will utilize RDP for lateral movement after conducting the discovery activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
