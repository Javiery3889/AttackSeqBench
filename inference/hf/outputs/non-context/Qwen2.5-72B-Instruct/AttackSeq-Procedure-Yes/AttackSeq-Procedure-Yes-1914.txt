### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group, specifically APT10, might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Internal Reconnaissance:** Using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for discovery.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure.
     - **Data Staging and Exfiltration:** Staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - APT10 is known to use various tools and techniques for internal reconnaissance to gather information about the network, systems, and users. This is a common first step in many APT campaigns.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - APT10 has been observed leveraging shared infrastructure, such as that of Managed Service Providers (MSPs), to move laterally within a network. This is a sophisticated technique that allows them to gain access to multiple systems and potentially different segments of the network.
   - **Data Staging and Exfiltration:**
     - APT10 is known to use various methods to stage and exfiltrate data. Staging data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin and using compression tools is a plausible method to avoid detection and efficiently transfer large amounts of data.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of APT10. Each step in the sequence is consistent with the group's behavior and capabilities.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that APT10 is likely to follow this sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
