### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group FIN4.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Labeling the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' during resource development.
     - Using spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials.
     - Transmitting those credentials to their C2 (Command and Control) servers for credential access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FIN4 Background:**
     - FIN4 is a well-known threat actor group that has been active since at least 2014.
     - They are known for targeting the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.
     - FIN4 often uses spearphishing emails to compromise victims.
   - **TTPs Analysis:**
     - **Labeling with Campaign Codes:**
       - This is a common practice in advanced threat actor groups to track and manage their campaigns.
       - It helps in understanding the success rate and impact of different campaigns.
     - **Spearphishing with VBA Macros:**
       - FIN4 has been known to use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to deliver malware.
       - These macros can be used to prompt victims for credentials or to download additional malware.
     - **Transmitting Credentials to C2 Servers:**
       - Once credentials are obtained, threat actors typically transmit them to their C2 servers for further use.
       - This is a standard procedure in credential theft operations.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of FIN4.
   - The use of campaign codes, spearphishing with VBA macros, and transmitting credentials to C2 servers are all consistent with FIN4's modus operandi.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
