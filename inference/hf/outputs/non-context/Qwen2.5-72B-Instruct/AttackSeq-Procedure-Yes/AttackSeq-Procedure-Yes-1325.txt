### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Searching removable drives for files.
     - Skipping certain file types during the discovery phase.
     - Using a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard.
     - Exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Searching Removable Drives for Files:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to find and collect sensitive information. CosmicDuke is known to search for files on removable drives as part of its data collection process.
   - **Skipping Certain File Types:**
     - Malware often skips certain file types to avoid detection or to focus on more valuable data. This is a plausible step in the discovery phase.
   - **Using a Clipboard Stealer:**
     - Clipboard stealers are used to capture data that users copy and paste, which can include sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and other credentials. CosmicDuke has been known to use clipboard stealers as part of its data collection methods.
   - **Exfiltrating Collected Information via FTP:**
     - Exfiltration is the final step in the attack sequence where the collected data is sent to a remote server. FTP is a common protocol used for this purpose, and CosmicDuke has been known to use FTP for exfiltration.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of CosmicDuke. Each step in the sequence is plausible and aligns with the malware's behavior.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
