### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Modifying the CCleaner binary to execute malicious code.
     - Decrypting a multi-stage payload as part of the execution phase.
     - Establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Modifying the CCleaner Binary:**
     - This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks, where legitimate software is tampered with to include malicious code. This is a known TTP and aligns with the initial phase of the attack.
   - **Decrypting a Multi-Stage Payload:**
     - Malware often uses multi-stage payloads to evade detection. The decryption of the payload is a typical step in the execution phase, where the actual malicious code is revealed and executed.
   - **Establishing a C2 Channel:**
     - Once the malicious code is executed, it is common for the malware to establish a C2 channel to communicate with the attacker's server. Using HTTPS POST requests to send encrypted and encoded system information is a sophisticated and common method to avoid detection and ensure secure communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the malware would establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests. This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
