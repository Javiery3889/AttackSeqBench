### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence initiated by the Darkhotel APT group.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware.
     - Using 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer to execute malicious code.
     - Maintaining persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Seeding Japanese P2P Sharing Sites:**
     - This is a common initial access technique used by various APT groups to distribute malware.
   - **Using 0-day Exploits:**
     - Darkhotel APT is known for using sophisticated techniques, including 0-day exploits, to gain initial access and execute malicious code.
   - **Maintaining Persistence:**
     - Adding autorun registry settings is a common method for maintaining persistence, ensuring that the malware runs every time the system starts.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Seeding P2P Sites:**
     - This method aligns with the initial access phase of the attack.
   - **0-day Exploits:**
     - Darkhotel APT has a history of using 0-day exploits, particularly targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer, to execute malicious code.
   - **Autorun Registry Settings:**
     - This method is a well-known persistence technique and fits well with the group's known tactics.

### Final Answer:
Given the historical behavior and known TTPs of the Darkhotel APT group, the described sequence of TTPs is highly plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
