### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where attackers collect Instagram credentials through phishing sites.
   - The next step in the sequence is whether the attackers will demand ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts after locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing for Credentials:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where attackers use phishing sites to trick victims into providing their login credentials.
   - **Locking Out Original Owners:** After obtaining the credentials, attackers can change the passwords to lock out the original owners. This is a common tactic to maintain control over the compromised accounts.
   - **Demanding Ransom Payments:** While it is possible for attackers to demand ransom payments, this is not the most common next step after locking out the original owners. Typically, attackers might use the compromised accounts for other purposes such as spreading malware, stealing personal information, or using the accounts for social engineering attacks.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Plausibility of Ransom Demands:** While ransom demands can occur, they are more common in scenarios involving the encryption of data (e.g., ransomware attacks) rather than the simple compromise of social media accounts.
   - **Common Next Steps:** After locking out the original owners, attackers are more likely to use the accounts for further malicious activities, such as spreading phishing links, stealing additional information, or using the accounts to gain access to other linked accounts.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is that after collecting Instagram credentials through phishing sites and locking out the original owners by changing the passwords, the attackers are more likely to use the compromised accounts for further malicious activities rather than demanding ransom payments.
