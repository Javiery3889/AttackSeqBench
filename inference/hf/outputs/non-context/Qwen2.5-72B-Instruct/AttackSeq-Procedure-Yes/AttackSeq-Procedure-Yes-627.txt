### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Delivering the malware via a compressed file ('Thu moi.7z') containing a VB Script file ('Thumoi.hta').
     - Executing the VB Script to drop and open a decoy Microsoft Word file.
     - Rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and a '.tmp' extension.
     - Creating a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file after rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder.
     - This is a common behavior in malware to ensure persistence and to avoid detection. Malware often drops executable files and executes them to carry out their malicious activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file.
     - This is less likely because the purpose of dropping an executable file is usually to execute it. If the malware does not execute the dropped file, it would not achieve its intended malicious goals.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with typical malware behavior:
     - **Initial Delivery:** The malware is delivered via a compressed file and a VB Script.
     - **Decoy File:** The VB Script drops and opens a decoy file to distract the user.
     - **Rewriting and Persistence:** The malware rewrites itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename to avoid detection.
     - **Execution:** The next logical step is to create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file to carry out its malicious activities.
   - Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will create a new process to execute the dropped '.exe' file.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
