### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - The PRB-Backdoor communicating with a C&C (Command and Control) server via the domain `hxxp://outl00k[.]net`.
     - The execution of PowerShell scripts triggered by a macro in a Word document.
     - The use of obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       - **PRB-Backdoor Communication with C&C Server:**
         - This is a common TTP in many malware campaigns. Once a backdoor is installed, it often communicates with a C&C server to receive further instructions.
       - **Execution of PowerShell Scripts Triggered by Macro:**
         - Macros in Word documents are frequently used to execute malicious code, including PowerShell scripts. This is a well-documented technique in many APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) campaigns.
       - **Obfuscated Macro Scripts for Defense Evasion:**
         - Obfuscation is a common technique used to evade detection by security software. It makes the code harder to analyze and understand.
     - The sequence described is logical and aligns with known attack patterns.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - However, the sequence described is a common and well-documented attack pattern in many cyber campaigns.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with known attack patterns:
     - **PRB-Backdoor Communication with C&C Server:**
       - This is a standard step in many malware campaigns.
     - **Execution of PowerShell Scripts Triggered by Macro:**
       - Macros in Word documents are frequently used to execute malicious code, including PowerShell scripts.
     - **Obfuscated Macro Scripts for Defense Evasion:**
       - Obfuscation is a common technique to evade detection.
   - Therefore, the sequence of TTPs is likely to have occurred in the described campaign.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
