### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by UNC1151.
   - Initial access was gained through spear phishing campaigns in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Ukraine.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that UNC1151 engaged in reconnaissance to gather victim network information, specifically targeting Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Germany, and focusing on Eastern Europe.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was achieved through spear phishing campaigns in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Ukraine. This is a common TTP for many threat actors, especially those targeting specific regions.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for threat actors to conduct reconnaissance to gather information about the victim's network. This helps them understand the network topology, identify valuable assets, and plan further actions.
   - **Targeting Specific Locations:**
     - The question mentions that the reconnaissance focused on Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Germany, and Eastern Europe. Given that the initial access was in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Ukraine, it is logical that the reconnaissance would focus on these areas.
     - Germany, while not mentioned in the initial access, is also in Eastern Europe and could be a logical target for further expansion or intelligence gathering.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical progression of TTPs and the focus on specific regions, it is highly likely that UNC1151 engaged in reconnaissance to gather victim network information, targeting the specified locations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
