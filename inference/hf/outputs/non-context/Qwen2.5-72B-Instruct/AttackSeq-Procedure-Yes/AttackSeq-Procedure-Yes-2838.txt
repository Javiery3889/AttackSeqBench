### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the malware:
     - Uses the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to gather system information.
     - Sends the gathered information to the IP address `45.124.132.127`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control (C2) server before contacting the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the C2 server before contacting `marina-info.net`.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not establish an HTTPS communication with the C2 server before contacting `marina-info.net`.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Information Gathering and Exfiltration:**
     - The malware has already gathered system information using `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` and sent it to `45.124.132.127`. This indicates that the initial exfiltration of data has been completed.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Typically, after initial data exfiltration, malware often establishes a more persistent and secure communication channel with the C2 server. This is often done to receive further commands or to maintain a long-term presence on the compromised system.
   - **Domain Contact:**
     - The domain `marina-info.net` is mentioned as a point of further operations. This could be a secondary C2 server or a target for additional malicious activities.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - Given the typical behavior of malware, it is plausible that after the initial data exfiltration, the malware would establish a more secure communication channel (such as HTTPS) with the C2 server before moving on to contact `marina-info.net`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the sequence of events described, it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the C2 server before contacting `marina-info.net`.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
