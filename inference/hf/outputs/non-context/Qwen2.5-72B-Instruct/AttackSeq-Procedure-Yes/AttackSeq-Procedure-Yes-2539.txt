### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Deep Panda.
   - The sequence involves using PowerShell scripts and batch files to execute the Milestone backdoor on infected systems.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Deep Panda would perform system information discovery before utilizing the backdoor to communicate uncompressed with a C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery:**
     - System information discovery is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. It helps the attacker understand the environment they are operating in, which can be crucial for further actions such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
     - According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, system information discovery is part of the "Discovery" tactic, which is often performed early in the attack lifecycle to gather information about the system and network.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:**
     - Communicating with a C2 server is a critical step for maintaining control over the compromised system and for exfiltrating data.
     - It is generally more effective for an attacker to have a good understanding of the system before establishing a C2 communication, as this can help in avoiding detection and in optimizing the communication process.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the importance of system information discovery in the early stages of an attack, it is highly likely that Deep Panda would perform this step before establishing communication with the C2 server.
   - Performing system information discovery first allows the attacker to gather necessary details about the system, which can be used to tailor the C2 communication and other subsequent actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
