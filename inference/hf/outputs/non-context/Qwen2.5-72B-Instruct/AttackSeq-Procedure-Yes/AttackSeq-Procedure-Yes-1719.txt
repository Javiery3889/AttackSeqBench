### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the CozyDuke malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Execution by a dropper using `rundll32.exe`.
     - Establishing persistence.
     - Utilizing COM-object hijacking to ensure continued execution.
     - Communicating with a C&C server via HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution by a dropper using `rundll32.exe`:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to execute malicious code. `rundll32.exe` is often used to load and execute DLLs, which can be a way to obfuscate the malware's presence.
   - **Establishing persistence:**
     - Persistence is a critical step for malware to ensure it remains active on the system after the initial infection. This can be achieved through various methods, such as registry keys, scheduled tasks, or service creation.
   - **Utilizing COM-object hijacking:**
     - COM-object hijacking is a technique where malware modifies the registry to hijack the creation of COM objects. This can be used to ensure that the malware is executed whenever a legitimate application tries to create a specific COM object.
   - **Communicating with a C&C server:**
     - Communication with a C&C server is a common final step for malware to receive commands, exfiltrate data, or update its configuration.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After being executed by a dropper using `rundll32.exe`, CozyDuke would likely establish persistence to ensure it remains on the system.
     - Utilizing COM-object hijacking is a sophisticated technique that can be used to maintain persistence and ensure continued execution, especially in environments where traditional persistence methods might be detected.
     - Finally, communicating with a C&C server is a logical next step for the malware to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the plausibility of the sequence and the sophistication of CozyDuke, it is likely that CozyDuke would utilize COM-object hijacking to ensure continued execution before communicating with its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
