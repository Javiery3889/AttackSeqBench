### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious file named 'intel.wll' is dropped into the Word startup folder to establish persistence.
   - The file requires a relaunch of Microsoft Word to execute.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) module downloaded during the final stage of the infection chain will have capabilities to take screenshots, list files and directories, and execute new processes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - Dropping 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder is a common technique to ensure that the malicious code runs every time Microsoft Word is launched. This establishes persistence, allowing the attacker to maintain access to the compromised system.
   - **RAT Capabilities:**
     - RATs are designed to provide attackers with a wide range of functionalities to control and interact with the compromised system.
     - Common capabilities of RATs include:
       - Taking screenshots to capture visual information.
       - Listing files and directories to explore the file system.
       - Executing new processes to run additional malicious code or tools.
   - **Final Stage of Infection Chain:**
     - The final stage of the infection chain typically involves the download and execution of the main payload, which in this case is the RAT module.
     - Given the nature of RATs, it is highly likely that the downloaded module will include the capabilities mentioned in the question.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that the RAT module downloaded during the final stage of the infection chain will have the capabilities to take screenshots, list files and directories, and execute new processes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
