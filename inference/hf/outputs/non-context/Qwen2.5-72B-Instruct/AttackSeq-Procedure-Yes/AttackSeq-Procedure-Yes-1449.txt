### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with a specific malware or tool called FoggyWeb.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Passively monitoring HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns.
     - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.
     - **C2 Capabilities:** Downloading additional components from a C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FoggyWeb is capable of performing all the described actions.
     - **Command and Control:** Monitoring HTTP GET and POST requests for custom URI patterns is a common C2 technique.
     - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrating sensitive data such as configuration databases and cryptographic certificates is a typical goal of advanced malware.
     - **C2 Capabilities:** Downloading additional components from a C2 server is also a common feature of sophisticated malware to maintain persistence and extend its capabilities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FoggyWeb is not capable of performing all the described actions.
     - Given the detailed and specific nature of the TTPs described, it is less likely that FoggyWeb would not be capable of these actions if they are part of its known behavior.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the detailed and specific TTPs described, it is highly plausible that FoggyWeb is capable of performing all the actions mentioned in the question.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
