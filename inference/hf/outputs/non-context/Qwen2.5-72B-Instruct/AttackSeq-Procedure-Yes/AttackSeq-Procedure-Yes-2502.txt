### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers use spear-phishing emails with malicious document attachments to gain initial access and execute RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware like RevengeRAT.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will collect credit card information from OTA (Online Travel Agency) websites during their operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and RAT Execution:**
     - Spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments are a common method for gaining initial access to a target environment.
     - Once the malicious document is opened, it can execute a RAT like RevengeRAT, which provides the attackers with remote access to the victim's system.
   - **Collection of Credit Card Information:**
     - The primary goal of using a RAT is to maintain persistence and gain control over the victim's system.
     - Attackers can use RATs to perform various actions, such as stealing sensitive information, exfiltrating data, and moving laterally within the network.
     - However, the specific goal of collecting credit card information from OTA websites is not a typical or primary objective for most RATs, especially in a general context.
     - Collecting credit card information typically requires more specialized tools and techniques, such as keyloggers or web injects, which are not necessarily part of the standard RAT toolkit.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical use cases and capabilities of RATs like RevengeRAT, it is less likely that the attackers would specifically target credit card information from OTA websites as part of their operations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely.

**Final Answer: B: No**
