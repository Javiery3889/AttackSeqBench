### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Tropic Trooper threat group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Defense Evasion:** Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to load the malicious `wab32res.dll` through a benign file.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** The question asks if TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (DLL Hijacking):**
     - DLL hijacking is a technique where a malicious DLL is loaded by a legitimate application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code while maintaining the appearance of a benign process. This is a common technique for evading detection.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - C2 communication is a critical phase in an attack where the malware communicates with the attacker's server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - Using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), is a common practice in C2 communication to encrypt the data and avoid detection by network security tools.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Tropic Trooper's TTPs:**
     - Tropic Trooper is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
     - Given that they use DLL hijacking to evade detection, it is reasonable to assume they would also use encrypted communication (SSL/TLS) to further obfuscate their C2 traffic.
   - **TClient and C2 Communication:**
     - TClient, being a component of Tropic Trooper's toolkit, is likely to follow the same sophisticated practices to maintain stealth.
     - Using SSL/TLS for C2 communication aligns with the group's known tactics to avoid detection and ensure secure communication with the C&C server.
