### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the VERMIN malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using ConfuserEx for defense evasion.
     - Collecting system information (machine name, username, OS name, architecture, and local IP address).
     - Deploying a keylogger component to collect keystrokes and clipboard data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **ConfuserEx for Defense Evasion:**
     - ConfuserEx is a popular .NET obfuscation tool used to make reverse engineering and analysis of malware more difficult. This is a common technique for defense evasion.
   - **System Information Discovery:**
     - Collecting system information such as machine name, username, OS name, architecture, and local IP address is a typical initial step in many malware operations. This information can be used to determine the environment and tailor further actions.
   - **Keylogger Component:**
     - Deploying a keylogger to collect keystrokes and clipboard data is a common technique for data collection and exfiltration, often used after initial reconnaissance.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible:
     - **Defense Evasion (ConfuserEx):** Malware often uses obfuscation tools to avoid detection.
     - **System Information Discovery:** Collecting system information is a standard reconnaissance step.
     - **Keylogger Deployment:** Deploying a keylogger is a logical next step after gathering system information, as it allows the attacker to collect sensitive data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
