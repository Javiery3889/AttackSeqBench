### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Explosive Trojan.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Credential Access:** Using keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Using writable mass storage devices (USB drives) infected through a configurable USB infection option.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Employing a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** Keylogging to gain administrator passwords is a common technique used by malware to escalate privileges and gain deeper access to the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using writable mass storage devices (USB drives) for lateral movement is a plausible technique. Malware can infect USB drives to spread to other systems when the drives are connected to different machines.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** A multi-tiered server backend framework is a sophisticated method for maintaining control over compromised systems. It can help the attacker manage multiple compromised hosts and avoid detection.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Credential Access:** The trojan gains initial access and steals administrator credentials.
     2. **Lateral Movement:** The trojan uses infected USB drives to spread to other systems within the network.
     3. **Command and Control (C2):** Once the trojan has spread and gained control over multiple systems, it establishes a multi-tiered C2 infrastructure to manage the compromised network.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns. The use of keylogging for credential access, followed by lateral movement via USB drives, and then establishing a C2 infrastructure is a common and effective strategy for advanced malware.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
