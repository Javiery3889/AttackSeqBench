### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the KONNI malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Using social engineering to prompt the target to open a .src file.
     - **Execution:** Displaying a decoy document to maintain the target's trust.
     - **Execution:** Executing arbitrary code on the infected host.
     - **Persistence:** Achieving persistence through methods such as creating a shortcut or naming a Windows shortcut as "adobe distillist.lnk".

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The use of social engineering to prompt the target to open a .src file is a common initial access technique. This is often followed by the display of a decoy document to maintain the target's trust.
   - **Execution:** Once the target opens the .src file, the malware typically executes arbitrary code on the infected host. This is a crucial step in the attack sequence as it allows the malware to perform its intended actions.
   - **Persistence:** After gaining initial access and executing arbitrary code, the malware often seeks to establish persistence to ensure it can maintain a foothold in the system. Creating a shortcut or naming a Windows shortcut as "adobe distillist.lnk" is a method of achieving persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker uses social engineering to get the target to open a malicious file.
     2. **Execution:** The malware executes arbitrary code on the host.
     3. **Persistence:** The malware then establishes persistence to ensure it can continue to operate even if the system is restarted.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the KONNI malware will move to execute arbitrary code on the infected host before achieving persistence. Based on the typical attack sequence, this is indeed the most plausible order of events.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
