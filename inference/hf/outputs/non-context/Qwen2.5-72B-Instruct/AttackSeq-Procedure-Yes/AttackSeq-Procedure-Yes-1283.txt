### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Tropic Trooper threat group.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
     - Executing the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`.
     - Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Equation Editor Exploits:**
     - Equation Editor exploits are known to be used by various threat actors to deliver malicious payloads. This is a common initial infection vector.
   - **FakeRun Loader:**
     - The FakeRun loader is a known tool used by Tropic Trooper to launch legitimate processes (like `dllhost.exe`) and then inject malicious code into them.
   - **Injecting a Malicious DLL:**
     - Once `dllhost.exe` is launched, it is plausible that Tropic Trooper would inject a malicious DLL backdoor into this process to maintain persistence and facilitate further attacks.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with known Tropic Trooper TTPs:
     - Initial infection via Equation Editor exploits.
     - Use of the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`.
     - Injection of a malicious DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the alignment of the described sequence with known Tropic Trooper TTPs, it is likely that Tropic Trooper would execute the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe` and then inject a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
