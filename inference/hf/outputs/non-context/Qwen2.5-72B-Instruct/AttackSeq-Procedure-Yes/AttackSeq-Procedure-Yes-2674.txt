### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where arbitrary code is executed using ZoxPNG, a tool that can embed commands within PNG files.
   - The code execution is initiated by commands received from a C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the C2 server will respond with a PNG file containing the next instruction for continued C2 communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **ZoxPNG and C2 Communication:**
     - ZoxPNG is a tool that can embed data, including commands, within PNG files. This technique is often used to obfuscate communication and evade detection.
     - In a typical C2 communication scenario, the C2 server sends commands to the compromised system to control it. These commands can be in various formats, including text, binary, or embedded within files like PNGs.
   - **Likelihood of PNG File Response:**
     - Given that ZoxPNG is used to execute arbitrary code, it is plausible that the C2 server would use the same method to send the next set of instructions.
     - Using a PNG file to embed the next command aligns with the initial method of communication and maintains consistency in the attack vector.
     - This approach also helps in evading detection by security systems that might not inspect the contents of PNG files.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that the C2 server will respond with a PNG file containing the next instruction for continued C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
