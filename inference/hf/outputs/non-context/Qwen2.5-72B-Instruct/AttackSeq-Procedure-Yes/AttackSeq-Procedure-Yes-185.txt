### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor "Infamous Chisel."
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data.
     2. Enumerating data directories to discover files of interest.
     3. Collecting GPS information.
     4. Automatically exfiltrating these files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data.**
     - This is a common initial step in data exfiltration, where the attacker gathers sensitive information from specific directories.
   - **Step 2: Enumerating data directories to discover files of interest.**
     - This step is logical and often follows the initial collection. The attacker needs to identify additional files that may be of interest.
   - **Step 3: Collecting GPS information.**
     - Collecting GPS information is less common but can be relevant in certain scenarios, such as when the attacker is interested in the physical location of the device or user.
   - **Step 4: Automatically exfiltrating these files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.**
     - Exfiltration using Tor and SSH is a sophisticated method to anonymize the data transfer and secure the communication channel. This is a plausible and advanced step in the exfiltration process.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors. Each step builds upon the previous one, leading to a comprehensive and sophisticated attack.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
