### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15.
   - The sequence involves using Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, then using a stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network, and finally deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Mimikatz for Credential Theft:**
     - Mimikatz is a well-known tool used to extract credentials from memory, including domain administrator credentials. This is a common initial step in many APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attacks.
   - **Stolen VPN Certificate for Remote Access:**
     - Using a stolen VPN certificate to gain remote access is a plausible next step. Once an attacker has domain administrator credentials, they can often access and exfiltrate sensitive information, including VPN certificates.
   - **Deploying Backdoors:**
     - Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS is a common tactic for maintaining persistence and ensuring long-term access to the network. These tools are known to be used by APT15.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with known APT15 TTPs.
   - APT15 is known for using a combination of credential theft, remote access, and backdoor deployment to maintain persistence and control over compromised networks.

### Final Answer:
