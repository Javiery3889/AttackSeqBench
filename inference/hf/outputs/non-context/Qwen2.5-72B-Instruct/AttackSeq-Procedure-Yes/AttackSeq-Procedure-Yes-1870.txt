### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Scote malware.
   - The malware employs techniques to evade detection.
   - It uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 (Command and Control) information.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware retrieves C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts before communicating with C2 servers to accept commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTPs for Evasion:**
     - Malware often uses evasion techniques to avoid detection by security systems. This can include using legitimate services to host C2 information, which can make it harder for security systems to identify and block the C2 traffic.
   - **Use of Legitimate Services:**
     - Pastebin and Google+ are legitimate online services that can be used to host text-based information. These services are often abused by malware to store C2 information because they are publicly accessible and can be easily updated.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The malware would first retrieve the C2 information from the legitimate service (e.g., Pastebin or Google+).
     - After retrieving the C2 information, the malware would then use this information to communicate with the C2 server to receive commands.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the description of the malware's behavior, it is highly plausible that Scote malware would retrieve C2 information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts before communicating with the C2 servers.
   - This aligns with common TTPs used by malware to evade detection and maintain a low profile.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
