### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Sednit group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting the victim's browser using CVE-2015-5119 (a Flash exploit).
     - Delivering a first-stage backdoor malware.
     - Leveraging a Windows privilege escalation exploit to gain higher privileges.
     - Using a scheduled task to establish persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2015-5119 Flash Exploit:**
     - This exploit is known to be used by various threat actors, including the Sednit group, to gain initial access to a victim's system.
   - **First-Stage Backdoor Malware:**
     - Once the exploit is successful, the Sednit group typically delivers a first-stage backdoor to establish a foothold in the victim's network.
   - **Windows Privilege Escalation:**
     - Gaining higher privileges is a common next step after initial access to ensure the attacker has the necessary permissions to perform further actions, such as establishing persistence.
   - **Scheduled Task for Persistence:**
     - Using a scheduled task is a common technique for establishing persistence, allowing the malware to run automatically at system startup or at regular intervals.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with the known TTPs of the Sednit group.
   - The group is known to use browser exploits to gain initial access, deliver backdoor malware, escalate privileges, and then establish persistence using various methods, including scheduled tasks.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
