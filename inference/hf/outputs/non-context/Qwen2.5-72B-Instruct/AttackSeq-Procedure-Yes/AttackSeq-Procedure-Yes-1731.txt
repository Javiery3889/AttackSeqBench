### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Privilege Escalation** using JuicyPotato.
     - **Credential Access** by capturing credentials from the Lsass.exe process using ProcDump and Mimikatz.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Fox Kitten campaign will develop 'STSRCheck' and use 'PORT.EXE' for network service discovery to map databases, servers, and open ports.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (JuicyPotato):**
     - JuicyPotato is a tool used to exploit a Windows vulnerability to escalate privileges. This is a common technique in the initial stages of an attack to gain higher-level access.
   - **Credential Access (ProcDump and Mimikatz):**
     - ProcDump is a tool used to create memory dumps of processes, and Mimikatz is a tool used to extract credentials from these memory dumps. This is a common technique to gain access to additional credentials, which can be used to move laterally within the network.
   - **Network Service Discovery (STSRCheck and PORT.EXE):**
     - 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' are not widely known tools in the context of network service discovery. However, the question implies that these tools are developed by the Fox Kitten campaign for this purpose.
   - **Fox Kitten Campaign:**
     - The Fox Kitten campaign is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks. It is plausible that they would develop custom tools to fit their specific needs, including network service discovery tools.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Stages:**
     - The use of JuicyPotato for privilege escalation and ProcDump and Mimikatz for credential access are well-documented and common techniques in the initial stages of an attack.
   - **Next Steps:**
     - After gaining higher privileges and accessing credentials, the next logical step in an attack is to map the network to identify potential targets (databases, servers, and open ports).
   - **Custom Tools:**
     - Given the sophistication of the Fox Kitten campaign, it is plausible that they would develop custom tools like 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' to perform network service discovery.
   - **Consistency with Known TTPs:**
     - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the known tactics of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, including the Fox Kitten campaign.
