### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Rising Sun implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     - Fetching computer name and user name information as part of discovery activities.
     - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Downloading to Startup Folder):**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1547 (Persistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).
   - **Discovery (Fetching Computer Name and User Name):**
     - Malware often collects system and user information to understand the environment it is operating in. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1082 (Discovery: System Information Discovery) and T1033 (Discovery: System Owner/User Discovery).
   - **Command and Control (Communicating with Control Servers):**
     - After gathering information, malware typically communicates with a command and control (C2) server to send data and receive further instructions. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071 (Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol) and T1105 (Command and Control: Ingress Tool Transfer).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common pattern for malware:
     1. **Persistence:** Ensuring the malware runs at startup.
     2. **Discovery:** Gathering system and user information.
     3. **Command and Control:** Communicating with the C2 server.
   - It is highly likely that the Rising Sun implant would follow this sequence to ensure it can maintain a foothold, understand its environment, and communicate with its operators.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
