### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether UNC2452 (a known threat actor) likely used Discovery techniques (such as querying the registry and identifying running processes) to gain knowledge about systems and the internal network before using the Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control (C2) communications.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery Techniques:**
     - Querying the registry
     - Identifying running processes
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communications:**
     - Using the Application Layer Protocol

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Techniques:**
     - These are common initial steps in an attack to understand the environment and identify potential targets. Threat actors often use these techniques to gather information about the system and network, which helps them in planning further actions.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communications:**
     - Once the threat actor has gathered enough information, they typically establish C2 communications to maintain control over the compromised system and to exfiltrate data or execute further commands.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - It is highly plausible that UNC2452, a sophisticated threat actor, would use Discovery techniques before establishing C2 communications. This is a standard attack pattern to ensure they have a thorough understanding of the environment before taking more advanced actions.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
