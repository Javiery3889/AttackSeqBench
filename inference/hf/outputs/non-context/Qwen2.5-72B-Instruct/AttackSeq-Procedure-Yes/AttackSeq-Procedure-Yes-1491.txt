### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the malware ZeroT.
   - The initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails with malicious .chm files or by exploiting CVE-2012-0158 in Word attachments.
   - The question then asks if ZeroT is likely to communicate with its C&C server over HTTP using a fake User-Agent before downloading stage-2 payloads using steganography in Bitmap URLs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - ZeroT is known to use spear-phishing emails with malicious .chm files or exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2012-0158 in Word attachments to gain initial access. This part of the sequence is consistent with known TTPs of ZeroT.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Malware often communicates with C&C servers to receive further instructions or download additional payloads. Using HTTP with a fake User-Agent is a common technique to evade detection by security systems.
   - **Steganography in Bitmap URLs:**
     - Steganography involves hiding data within other data, such as images. Using steganography in Bitmap URLs to download stage-2 payloads is a sophisticated technique that can help evade detection by network security tools.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - ZeroT is known to use spear-phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access. This is a well-documented TTP.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Communicating with C&C servers over HTTP using a fake User-Agent is a common technique to avoid detection. This aligns with the behavior of many malware families, including ZeroT.
   - **Steganography:**
     - Using steganography to hide payloads within images (Bitmap URLs) is a known technique used by advanced malware to evade detection. This is a plausible step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of ZeroT. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
