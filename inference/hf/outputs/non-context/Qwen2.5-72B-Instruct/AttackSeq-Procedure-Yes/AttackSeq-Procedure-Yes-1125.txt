### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying a final payload that establishes a remote command shell.
     - Configuring systems for exfiltration by creating a `desktop.ini` file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder.
     - Collecting system information such as volume names and free disk space.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deploying a Final Payload:**
     - Establishing a remote command shell is a common technique used by APT groups to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1090 (Proxy) and T1087 (Account Discovery).
   - **Configuring Systems for Exfiltration:**
     - Creating a `desktop.ini` file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder is a technique used to hide malicious files and directories. This can be part of the T1036 (Masquerading) and T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host) techniques.
   - **Collecting System Information:**
     - Collecting system information such as volume names and free disk space is a common reconnaissance activity. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1082 (System Information Discovery) and T1083 (File and Directory Discovery).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - APT groups often use a combination of techniques to maintain persistence, hide their activities, and gather information.
     - Creating a `desktop.ini` file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder is a sophisticated method to avoid detection, which is typical of APT groups.
     - Collecting system information is a necessary step before exfiltration to ensure that the data can be efficiently and stealthily transferred.
