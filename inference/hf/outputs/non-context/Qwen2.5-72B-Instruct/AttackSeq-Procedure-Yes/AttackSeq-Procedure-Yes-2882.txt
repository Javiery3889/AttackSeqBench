### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries use functions like `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwMapViewOfSection` to manipulate memory and processes to evade detection.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversaries would package and transmit data over HTTP/HTTPS to a command and control (C2) server as part of their C2 activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTPs for Evasion:**
     - `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` is used to change the memory protection of a region of pages in the virtual address space of a process. This can be used to evade detection by altering the memory to hide malicious code or data.
     - `ZwMapViewOfSection` is used to map a view of a section object into the address space of a process. This can be used to load or unload code or data into memory, which can also help in evading detection.
   - **C2 Activities:**
     - After evading detection, it is common for adversaries to establish communication with a C2 server to exfiltrate data, receive further instructions, or maintain persistence.
     - HTTP/HTTPS are common protocols used for C2 communication because they blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect malicious activities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwMapViewOfSection` for memory manipulation and process evasion is a typical initial step in many advanced attacks.
   - Once the adversaries have successfully evaded detection, they often need to communicate with a C2 server to continue their operations.
   - Using HTTP/HTTPS for C2 communication is a common and effective method because it is widely used and can easily blend in with legitimate traffic, making it harder for network defenses to detect and block.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
