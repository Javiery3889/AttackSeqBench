### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by The Inception attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Reconnaissance Spear Phish:** Gathering information about the targets.
     2. **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word:** Using a known vulnerability to gain initial access.
     3. **Deployment of PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER:** Executing activities using a backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Spear Phish:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. It involves gathering information about the target to craft a more convincing phishing email.
   - **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word:** CVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. Using remote templates in Microsoft Word is a method to deliver the exploit.
   - **Deployment of PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER:** Once the initial access is gained, deploying a backdoor like POWERSHOWER allows the attackers to maintain persistence and execute further commands.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Gather information to craft a targeted attack.
     2. **Initial Access:** Use a known vulnerability to gain a foothold in the target's system.
     3. **Execution and Persistence:** Deploy a backdoor to maintain access and execute further activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the commonality of these TTPs in cyber attacks, it is likely that The Inception attackers would follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
