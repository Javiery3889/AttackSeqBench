### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by adversaries.
   - The sequence starts with the abuse of PowerShell for the execution of the Empire stager.
   - The next step involves establishing persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects (CLSID: D9144DCD-E998-4ECA-AB6A-DCD83CCBA16D).
   - The final step involves concealing execution of malicious payloads through reflective code loading.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell Abuse for Empire Stager:**
     - PowerShell is a common tool used by adversaries for initial access and execution of stagers like Empire. This is a well-documented technique (T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter).
   - **Establishing Persistence via COM Object Hijacking:**
     - Hijacking COM objects is a technique used to maintain persistence (T1546: Event Triggered Execution). The specific CLSID mentioned (D9144DCD-E998-4ECA-AB6A-DCD83CCBA16D) is known to be associated with certain persistence mechanisms.
   - **Concealing Execution via Reflective Code Loading:**
     - Reflective code loading is a technique used to execute code in memory without writing it to disk, which helps in evading detection (T1055: Process Injection).

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression:
     1. **Initial Access and Execution:**
        - Using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager is a common initial step.
     2. **Persistence:**
        - Establishing persistence through COM object hijacking is a logical next step to ensure the adversary can maintain access over time.
     3. **Evasion:**
        - Concealing the execution of malicious payloads through reflective code loading is a common technique to avoid detection and maintain stealth.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression and the commonality of these techniques in cyber attacks, the sequence described is plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
