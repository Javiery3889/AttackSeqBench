### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the SolarWinds supply chain was compromised, and the Sunburst backdoor was delivered to target systems.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 (Command and Control) server using a protocol for further exploitation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - The Sunburst backdoor is known to communicate with its C2 server to receive further instructions and commands. This is a common behavior for backdoors and malware to maintain persistence and execute additional stages of an attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the Sunburst backdoor would not communicate with a C2 server, which is highly unlikely given the nature of backdoors and the objectives of the attackers.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Sunburst backdoor, once installed on a target system, is designed to establish a covert communication channel with its C2 server. This communication is essential for the attackers to:
     - Receive commands and instructions.
     - Exfiltrate data.
     - Deploy additional payloads.
     - Maintain persistence on the compromised system.
   - The use of a protocol for C2 communication is a fundamental aspect of the Sunburst backdoor's functionality and aligns with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### Final Answer: A: Yes
