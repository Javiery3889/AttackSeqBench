### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using backdoors to list interesting files (e.g., Office documents).
     - Scanning all drives, including removable drives and network shares mounted as drives, for sensitive data.
     - Automatically uploading the harvested documents to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon is likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data before uploading the harvested documents.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors who aim to maximize the amount of sensitive data they can exfiltrate.
     - Scanning all drives, including removable and network shares, is a common technique to ensure that no potentially valuable data is missed.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon is not likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data.
     - This would be less thorough and could result in missing valuable data, which is not typical of sophisticated threat actors like Gamaredon.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the thorough nature of advanced threat actors and the importance of maximizing data exfiltration, it is more plausible that Gamaredon would scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data before uploading the harvested documents.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
