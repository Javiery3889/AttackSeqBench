### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the 'yty' framework.
   - The framework disguises its C2 (Command and Control) communication using a football-themed strategy.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the framework will exfiltrate data such as file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots back to the C2 server using plugins like 'abode.exe'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP Analysis:**
     - **Disguising C2 Communication:** The use of a football-themed strategy to disguise C2 communication is a common technique to avoid detection. This is often done by mimicking legitimate traffic or using obfuscation techniques.
     - **Exfiltration of Data:** Exfiltrating data such as file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots is a typical next step after establishing C2 communication. This is because the attacker needs to gather and send valuable information back to the C2 server.
     - **Use of Plugins:** The mention of 'abode.exe' as a plugin suggests that the framework has modular capabilities, which is common in advanced malware. Plugins are often used to perform specific tasks, such as data exfiltration.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the 'yty' framework has already established a disguised C2 communication, it is highly likely that the next step would be to exfiltrate data. This is a logical progression in the attack lifecycle.
   - The use of plugins like 'abode.exe' further supports this likelihood, as plugins are often designed to perform specific tasks, including data exfiltration.
   - The combination of these TTPs (disguised C2 communication and data exfiltration) is consistent with the behavior of sophisticated malware.
