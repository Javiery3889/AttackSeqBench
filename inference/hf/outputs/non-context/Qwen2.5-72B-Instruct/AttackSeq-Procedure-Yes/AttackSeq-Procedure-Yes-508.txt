### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
     - Using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following these steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - The use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a common technique to bypass network security measures and establish a covert channel.
   - **Using SSL-encrypted Traffic and RSA-secured AES Key Exchanges:**
     - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are used to encrypt data in transit, making it difficult for eavesdroppers to intercept the communication.
     - RSA-secured AES key exchanges ensure that the encryption keys used for the SSL/TLS session are securely exchanged, adding an additional layer of security.
   - **Exfiltration of Data:**
     - Once a secure and encrypted C2 channel is established, it is highly likely that the SombRAT backdoor will use this channel to exfiltrate data. The secure nature of the channel (SSL-encrypted and RSA-secured) makes it an ideal medium for data exfiltration, as it provides both confidentiality and integrity.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the secure and encrypted nature of the C2 communication, it is highly likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over this channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
