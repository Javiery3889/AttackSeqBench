### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT-TOCS.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Lateral Movement through Network Projection:** This involves moving from one system to another within the internal network.
     - **Using PowerShell to Download Encrypted Data Scripts for Command and Control (C2) Operations:** This involves using PowerShell to download scripts that are encrypted and used for C2.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement through Network Projection:**
     - This is a common TTP used by advanced threat actors to spread within a network. Techniques under this category include using legitimate credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using remote desktop protocols.
   - **Using PowerShell to Download Encrypted Data Scripts for C2:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and shell that is often used by attackers for various purposes, including downloading and executing malicious scripts.
     - Encrypted data scripts are used to obfuscate the content of the scripts, making it harder for security tools to detect malicious activity.
     - C2 operations involve maintaining communication between the attacker and the compromised system, which is a crucial step in many attack sequences.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - After lateral movement, it is common for attackers to establish a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - Using PowerShell to download encrypted scripts is a sophisticated method to achieve this, as it leverages a trusted and widely used tool (PowerShell) and adds an extra layer of obfuscation (encryption) to avoid detection.

### Final Answer:
Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly plausible that APT-TOCS would use PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts for C2 operations after lateral movement through network projection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
