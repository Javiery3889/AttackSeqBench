### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the BADBOX malware.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors.
     2. Using a backdoor connection to a command-and-control (C2) server.
     3. Injecting additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:**
     - This is a common initial access technique where attackers compromise the supply chain to gain access to devices. This is a plausible first step.
   - **Using a Backdoor Connection to a C2 Server:**
     - Once the malware is installed, it often establishes a backdoor connection to a C2 server to receive further instructions. This is a typical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Injecting Additional Modules:**
     - After establishing a connection to the C2 server, the malware can receive additional modules to expand its capabilities. This is a logical subsequent step to enhance the malware's functionality.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. Initial access through supply chain vulnerabilities.
     2. Establishing a backdoor connection to a C2 server.
     3. Injecting additional modules to enable further capabilities.
   - This sequence aligns with typical malware behavior and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
