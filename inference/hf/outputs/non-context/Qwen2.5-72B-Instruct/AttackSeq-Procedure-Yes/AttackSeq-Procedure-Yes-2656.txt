### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Korplug malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting metadata and content from local systems.
     - Collecting data from removable media.
     - Gathering data from network shared drives.
     - Data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after collecting data from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives, Korplug will proceed with data exfiltration using an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of malware, which often collects data from various sources and then exfiltrates it to a remote server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Korplug will not proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.
     - This is less likely, as the primary goal of malware is often to exfiltrate the collected data to a remote server for further use by the attacker.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a common attack pattern where malware collects data from multiple sources and then exfiltrates it.
   - Korplug, like many other malware, is designed to steal data and send it back to the attacker.
   - Using an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol for exfiltration is a common technique to avoid detection and ensure the data is transmitted securely.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
