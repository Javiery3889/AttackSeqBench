### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with the discovery phase, where attackers gather information about systems, users, and data.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where attackers gather information about the target environment. This can include network topology, user accounts, and system configurations.
   - **Exploiting Remote Services for Lateral Movement:** Once the attackers have gathered the necessary information, they often use this knowledge to exploit vulnerabilities in remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to move laterally within the network. This allows them to gain access to additional systems.
   - **Installing Persistence Points:** After gaining access to new systems, attackers typically install persistence mechanisms to ensure they can maintain access over time. This can include creating new user accounts, modifying system configurations, or installing backdoors.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common progression in cyber attacks:
     1. **Discovery:** Gather information about the target environment.
     2. **Exploitation of Remote Services:** Use the gathered information to exploit vulnerabilities and move laterally.
     3. **Persistence Installation:** Once access to new systems is gained, install persistence mechanisms to maintain control.
   - This sequence aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which outlines these steps as part of the attack lifecycle.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
