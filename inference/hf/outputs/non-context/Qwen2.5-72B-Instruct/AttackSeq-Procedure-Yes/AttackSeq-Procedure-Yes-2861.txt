### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario involving a compromised version of CCleaner 5.33.
   - The binary in question is said to execute malicious code by calling a specific function (`CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)`) and initiating the decryption of a malicious payload.
   - The CCleaner installation package is signed with a valid digital certificate.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - The scenario aligns with known attack patterns where legitimate software is compromised and used to deliver malware.
     - The use of a valid digital certificate is a common technique to bypass security checks and gain user trust.
     - The specific function call (`CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)`) and the decryption of a payload are consistent with the behavior of malware that is embedded in legitimate software.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely.
     - However, the scenario described is well-documented in the context of supply chain attacks, such as the NotPetya and CCleaner incidents.
     - The use of a valid digital certificate and the specific function call are strong indicators of a sophisticated attack.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment with known attack patterns and the specific details provided, the most plausible answer is that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
