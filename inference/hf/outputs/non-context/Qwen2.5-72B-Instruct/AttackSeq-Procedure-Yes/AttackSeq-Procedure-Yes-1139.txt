### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Buckeye.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Using a keylogger to gather credentials.
     - Using tools like ChromePass and Lazagne to gather credentials.
   - The question then asks if Buckeye is likely to focus on file and print servers to collect data from network shared drives after gathering credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger and Credential Gathering Tools:**
     - Keyloggers and tools like ChromePass and Lazagne are commonly used to gather credentials from victims. These credentials can include usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information.
   - **File and Print Servers:**
     - File and print servers are often used to store and share important documents and data within an organization. They are typically part of the network infrastructure and are accessible via network shared drives.
   - **Logical Next Step:**
     - After gathering credentials, it is logical for an attacker to use these credentials to access network resources, such as file and print servers, to collect additional data. This is a common tactic in the post-exploitation phase of an attack.
   - **Buckeye's TTPs:**
     - Buckeye, a known threat actor, has been observed to use a variety of TTPs, including credential harvesting and lateral movement. Accessing file and print servers to collect data aligns with their known behavior.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the known behavior of Buckeye, it is highly likely that Buckeye would focus on file and print servers to collect data from network shared drives after gathering credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
