### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the Ke3chang group.
   - The initial access is gained via spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545.
   - The question asks if Ke3chang is likely to perform inter-process communication using TidePool malware before achieving persistence through the creation of an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2015-2545. This is a known technique used by various threat actors, including Ke3chang.
   - **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using TidePool:**
     - TidePool is a malware family associated with the Ke3chang group. It is known for its capabilities in inter-process communication (IPC) and other post-exploitation activities.
   - **Persistence through ActiveSetup:**
     - Creating an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry is a common method for achieving persistence. This technique ensures that the malware runs every time a user logs in.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attacker would likely use the malware (TidePool) to perform necessary post-exploitation activities, such as inter-process communication, to maintain control and gather information.
     - Once the necessary information is gathered and the environment is understood, the attacker would then set up persistence to ensure long-term access to the compromised system.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that Ke3chang would use TidePool for IPC before setting up persistence. This aligns with the typical attack lifecycle where initial access is followed by post-exploitation activities and then persistence.

### Final Answer:
