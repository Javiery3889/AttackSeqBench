### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the GHOLE malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Persistence:** Using a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs'.
     - **Defense Evasion:** Creating a mutex called 'woolger'.
     - **Command and Control (C&C) Communication:** Communicating with C&C servers.
     - **Data Exfiltration:** Uploading keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (VBScript 'wsc.vbs'):** This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts or at regular intervals. VBScript is often used for this purpose due to its scripting capabilities and the ability to run on Windows systems.
   - **Defense Evasion (Mutex 'woolger'):** Creating a mutex is a technique used to prevent multiple instances of the malware from running simultaneously, which can help evade detection by security software. The name 'woolger' is specific to this malware and is likely used to avoid detection by signature-based methods.
   - **C&C Communication:** Malware often communicates with C&C servers to receive commands, update itself, or exfiltrate data. This is a standard part of the malware lifecycle.
   - **Data Exfiltration (Keystroke Logs):** Keyloggers are a common type of malware that capture keystrokes and send them to a remote server. The threshold of 3,000 bytes is a specific detail that suggests the malware is designed to send significant amounts of data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and follows a typical malware attack pattern:
     1. **Persistence:** Ensuring the malware runs persistently.
     2. **Defense Evasion:** Using a mutex to avoid detection.
     3. **C&C Communication:** Establishing a connection to the C&C server.
     4. **Data Exfiltration:** Sending captured keystrokes to the C&C server.
   - The specific details (VBScript name, mutex name, and keystroke log size) are consistent with the behavior of sophisticated malware like GHOLE and its associated keylogger, CWoolger.
