### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving two different APT groups: APT3 and APT18.
   - APT3 exploits a zero-day vulnerability disclosed in the Hacking Team data leak via phishing emails to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses.
   - Additionally, it mentions that GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18's phishing campaign, calls out to an APT18 CnC address.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT3 and SHOTPUT Backdoor:**
     - APT3 is known for using sophisticated techniques and tools, including zero-day vulnerabilities and backdoors like SHOTPUT.
     - SHOTPUT is a backdoor that has been associated with APT3 and is known to communicate with CnC servers. However, the specific method of communication (e.g., hardcoded CnC addresses) is not explicitly mentioned in the question.
   - **APT18 and GH0ST RAT:**
     - APT18 is known for using GH0ST RAT, a remote access trojan.
     - GH0ST RAT is typically configured to communicate with CnC servers, and it is common for APT18 to use CnC addresses that are specific to their operations.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **SHOTPUT Backdoor:**
     - While SHOTPUT is known to communicate with CnC servers, the use of hardcoded CnC addresses is not a universal characteristic of all backdoors. Some backdoors use more dynamic methods to avoid detection and ensure persistence.
     - However, it is plausible that SHOTPUT could use hardcoded CnC addresses, especially in earlier versions or specific campaigns.
   - **GH0ST RAT:**
     - GH0ST RAT is known to communicate with CnC servers, and it is common for APT18 to use CnC addresses that are specific to their operations. This aligns with the description in the question.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that both conditions are true:
     - SHOTPUT backdoor communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses.
     - GH0ST RAT calls out to an APT18 CnC address.
   - Given the known characteristics of both APT groups and their tools, it is plausible that both conditions could be true.
