### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) establishes DNS Command and Control (C2) communication by constructing unique DNS queries with obfuscated data.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the CopyKittens group will perform data exfiltration over the DNS protocol as part of their attack sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CopyKittens Group:**
     - CopyKittens is a known threat actor group that has been active since at least 2013. They are known for their sophisticated cyber espionage campaigns.
     - They often use a variety of techniques to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data from compromised systems.
   - **DNS C2 Communication:**
     - DNS is a common protocol used for C2 communication because it is often allowed through firewalls and is less likely to be blocked or monitored.
     - Once a C2 channel is established, threat actors can use it for various purposes, including data exfiltration.
   - **Data Exfiltration over DNS:**
     - Data exfiltration over DNS involves encoding data into DNS queries or responses, which can be a stealthy method to transfer data out of a network.
     - This technique is known and has been used by various threat actors, including sophisticated groups like CopyKittens.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that CopyKittens is a sophisticated group and they have established a DNS C2 channel, it is highly likely that they would use this channel for data exfiltration.
   - DNS is a versatile protocol that can be used for both C2 communication and data exfiltration, making it a logical choice for a group like CopyKittens.
   - The use of obfuscated data in DNS queries suggests that the group is taking steps to avoid detection, which is consistent with their known tactics.
