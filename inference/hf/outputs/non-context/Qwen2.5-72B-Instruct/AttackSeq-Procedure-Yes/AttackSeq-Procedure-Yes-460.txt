### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Hidden Cobra group.
   - The sequence starts with the use of the Bankshot malware implant for reconnaissance.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group would use a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform to distribute Bankshot implants during the resource development phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The use of Bankshot malware for reconnaissance is a common tactic in the initial stages of an attack. This phase involves gathering information about the target to plan subsequent actions.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The resource development phase involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and tools to support the attack. This can include setting up malicious domains, creating malware, and other preparatory activities.
   - **Distributing Malware via a Malicious Domain:**
     - Using a malicious domain that resembles a legitimate service (like a cryptocurrency-lending platform) is a common technique to trick victims into downloading malware. This is often part of the delivery phase, which follows the resource development phase.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The reconnaissance phase (using Bankshot for information collection) is a logical first step.
   - The resource development phase involves setting up the infrastructure to support the attack, which can include creating and using malicious domains.
   - Distributing malware via a malicious domain is a common technique used in the delivery phase, which logically follows the resource development phase.

### Final Answer:
Given the logical progression of TTPs from reconnaissance to resource development to delivery, it is plausible that Hidden Cobra would use a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform to distribute Bankshot implants during the resource development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
