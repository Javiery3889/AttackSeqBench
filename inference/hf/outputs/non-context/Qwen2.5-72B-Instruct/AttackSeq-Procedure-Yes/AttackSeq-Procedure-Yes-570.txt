### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where malware:
     - Collects information such as IP address, hostname, and Bitcoin wallet addresses from registry keys.
     - Uploads the collected information to Dropbox.
     - Connects to a C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Uses the Dropbox API for command and control operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed connect to a C&C server and use the Dropbox API for command and control operations.
     - This is plausible because:
       - Malware often uses multiple communication channels to ensure resilience and redundancy.
       - Dropbox can be used as a covert channel for C&C operations, as it is a legitimate service that is less likely to be blocked by network security measures.
       - The initial data exfiltration to Dropbox suggests that the malware is already using Dropbox as a communication channel, making it a logical next step to use it for C&C.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not connect to a C&C server and use the Dropbox API for command and control operations.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - While the malware has already exfiltrated data to Dropbox, it is common for malware to establish a more direct and persistent C&C channel.
       - Using Dropbox for C&C is a known technique, and the malware's use of Dropbox for data exfiltration suggests it is capable of using it for other purposes.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will connect to a C&C server and use the Dropbox API for command and control operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
