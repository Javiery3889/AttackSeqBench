### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Deep Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exfiltration of data over a C2 (Command and Control) channel using the Milestone backdoor.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the initial access was gained by exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache Log4j library, which is widely used in various applications, including VMware Horizon servers.
     - Exploiting Log4Shell can provide initial access to a target system, allowing the threat actor to deploy a backdoor or other malicious software.
   - **Backdoor and Exfiltration:**
     - The Milestone backdoor is a known tool used by Deep Panda for maintaining persistence and exfiltrating data.
     - Once the initial access is gained, the threat actor can deploy the Milestone backdoor to establish a C2 channel and exfiltrate data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that Deep Panda used the Log4Shell vulnerability to gain initial access to the target system. This is a common and effective method for initial access, especially given the widespread use of VMware Horizon servers.
     - After gaining initial access, deploying the Milestone backdoor to establish a C2 channel and exfiltrate data is a logical next step in the attack sequence.
   - **Context:**
     - Deep Panda is known for using sophisticated TTPs, including exploiting known vulnerabilities and deploying custom backdoors.
     - The Log4Shell vulnerability was a significant threat in 2021 and 2022, making it a likely target for threat actors like Deep Panda.
