### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Impersonating technical support or friends.
     2. Delivering phishing messages claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges.
     3. Using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials.
     4. Locking out the original owners by changing account passwords.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - The sequence is plausible because:
       - Impersonation is a common technique used in social engineering attacks.
       - Phishing messages with urgent or enticing content (like copyright violations or verified badges) are effective in tricking users.
       - Phishing sites are a common method to collect credentials.
       - Changing account passwords to lock out the original owners is a logical next step to maintain control of the compromised account.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - This choice is less plausible because:
       - The sequence follows a logical and common attack pattern.
       - Each step in the sequence is a well-documented technique used by attackers.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**.
