### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Inserting malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal.
     2. Redirecting victims to an exploit landing page.
     3. Exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
     4. Using heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive.
     5. Executing an embedded shellcode payload.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Inserting Malicious JavaScript:**
     - This is a common initial step in web-based attacks. Attackers often inject malicious JavaScript into legitimate websites to redirect users to exploit landing pages.
   - **Redirecting Victims:**
     - Once the malicious JavaScript is executed, it can redirect users to a controlled server hosting the exploit.
   - **Exploiting CVE-2019-13720:**
     - CVE-2019-13720 is a vulnerability in Google Chrome that could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. This aligns with the next steps in the sequence.
   - **Heap Spraying:**
     - Heap spraying is a technique used to increase the likelihood of successful exploitation by filling the memory with a specific pattern of code. This is often used in conjunction with vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-13720 to gain control over the execution flow.
   - **Executing Shellcode:**
     - Once the exploit is successful and the attacker gains control, they can execute the embedded shellcode to perform further actions.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and logical progression of TTPs. Each step logically leads to the next, and the techniques mentioned are commonly used in such attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
