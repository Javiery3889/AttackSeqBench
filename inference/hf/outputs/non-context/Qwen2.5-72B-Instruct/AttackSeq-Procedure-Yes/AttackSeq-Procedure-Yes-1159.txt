### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware PROMETHIUM.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Collection Phase:** Searching for and compressing Microsoft Office files into archives.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** Encoding the archives with an unusual scheme and splitting them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that PROMETHIUM will indeed encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltration.
     - This is a plausible sequence because:
       - **Encoding with an Unusual Scheme:** Malware often uses encoding or encryption to obfuscate the data being exfiltrated, making it harder to detect or intercept.
       - **Splitting into Chunks:** Splitting data into smaller chunks can help avoid detection by network monitoring tools, as large data transfers are more likely to be flagged as suspicious.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that PROMETHIUM will not encode the archives with an unusual scheme or split them into chunks before exfiltration.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - Not encoding or splitting the data would make the exfiltration more detectable and easier to block by security measures.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that PROMETHIUM will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
