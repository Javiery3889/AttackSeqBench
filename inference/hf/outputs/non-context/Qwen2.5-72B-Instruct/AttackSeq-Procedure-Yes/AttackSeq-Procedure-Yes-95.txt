### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document.
     - Dropping an HTA file.
     - Using WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
     - Executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 (Command and Control) server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document:**
     - CVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Dropping an HTA file:**
     - An HTA (HTML Application) file can be used to execute scripts and other code on the victim's machine. This is a common technique for delivering payloads.
   - **Using WMI to check for installed antivirus software:**
     - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) can be used to gather system information, including the presence of antivirus software. This is a reconnaissance technique to avoid detection.
   - **Executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion:**
     - DLL sideloading is a technique where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL, which can help evade detection by security software.
   - **Communicating with the C2 server and leveraging webserv-redir.net:**
     - Once the backdoor is executed, it is common for malware to establish a C2 channel to receive further instructions. Using a domain like webserv-redir.net for C2 is a plausible scenario, especially if the domain is known to be used by the attackers.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with a well-planned and sophisticated attack.
   - The use of an HTA file to drop a backdoor and the subsequent communication with a C2 server is a common pattern in malware operations.
   - The domain webserv-redir.net, if known to be associated with the attackers, would be a logical choice for C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
