### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using utilities like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory.
     - Executing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using ProcDump to Dump LSASS Process Memory:**
     - This is a technique often used to extract credentials from the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process. This is typically done after gaining some level of access to the system.
   - **Executing Passive Backdoors like BLUEAGAVE:**
     - BLUEAGAVE is a passive backdoor that allows for command execution. This is typically used to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system.
   - **Exploiting External Servers and Deploying Web Shells:**
     - Web shells are often used to establish initial access to a network by compromising web servers. This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle, often preceding the more advanced techniques like credential dumping and backdoor execution.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (using ProcDump and executing BLUEAGAVE) suggests that FIN13 has already gained access to the network and is performing post-exploitation activities.
   - Establishing initial access via web shells is typically an earlier step in the attack lifecycle, often occurring before the attacker has the level of access required to dump LSASS memory or deploy backdoors.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that FIN13 would exploit external servers and deploy web shells after performing the more advanced post-exploitation activities described.

### Final Answer: B: No
