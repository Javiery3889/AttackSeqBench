### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
     - Stealing a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
     - Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
     - Leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Mimikatz for Credential Theft:**
     - Mimikatz is a well-known tool used by APT groups, including APT15, to extract credentials from memory. This is a common initial step in many attack sequences to gain higher privileges.
   - **Stealing a VPN Certificate:**
     - Stealing a VPN certificate is a logical next step after obtaining domain administrator credentials. This allows the attacker to maintain persistent access to the network.
   - **Deploying Backdoors:**
     - APT15 is known to use backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. These tools are designed to maintain long-term access to the network and to execute commands remotely.
   - **Leveraging RoyalCLI:**
     - RoyalCLI is a command-line tool that can be used to execute commands and scripts. Bypassing command prompt policy settings is a common technique to ensure that the attacker can execute their commands without being blocked by security policies.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with the known TTPs of APT15. Each step in the sequence is a logical and common tactic used by this group to gain and maintain access to a network.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
