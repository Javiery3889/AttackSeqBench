### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the T9000 malware.
   - The sequence starts with the malware leveraging an RTF file to exploit known vulnerabilities and activating a multi-stage shellcode process for delivery.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use methods such as sideloading a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll) through a legitimate executable (igfxtray.exe), setting registry keys, and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exploitation:**
     - The malware starts by exploiting an RTF file to deliver a multi-stage shellcode process. This is a common initial attack vector used by many malware families to gain initial access to a system.
   - **DLL Sideloading:**
     - DLL sideloading is a technique where a legitimate executable is tricked into loading a malicious DLL. This is a well-known technique used to evade detection and maintain persistence.
     - The use of a legitimate executable (igfxtray.exe) to load a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll) is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
   - **Setting Registry Keys:**
     - Setting registry keys is a common method for achieving persistence. Malware often modifies registry keys to ensure it runs at system startup or to maintain control over the system.
   - **Injecting into explorer.exe:**
     - Injecting a malicious DLL (ResN32.dll) into explorer.exe is another common technique for maintaining persistence and ensuring the malware remains active on the system.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial exploitation using an RTF file and multi-stage shellcode is a typical entry point for malware.
   - DLL sideloading through a legitimate executable is a sophisticated technique that aligns with the behavior of advanced malware.
   - Setting registry keys for persistence is a standard practice in malware to ensure it runs at system startup.
   - Injecting a malicious DLL into explorer.exe is a common method to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that T9000 malware would use these methods to achieve its goals. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
