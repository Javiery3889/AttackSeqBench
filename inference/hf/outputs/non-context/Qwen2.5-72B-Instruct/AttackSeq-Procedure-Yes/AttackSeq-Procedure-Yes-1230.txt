### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882.
   - The attackers gain initial access via remote templates in Microsoft Word.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER before establishing persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access via remote templates in Microsoft Word is a known technique. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
   - **Deployment of POWERSHOWER:**
     - POWERSHOWER is a PowerShell-based backdoor. It is often used to maintain access and execute commands on the compromised system.
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - Establishing persistence is a critical step in maintaining long-term access to the compromised system. Writing the backdoor to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry are common methods to achieve this.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is logical for the attackers to deploy the backdoor (POWERSHOWER) to maintain control over the system.
     - Once the backdoor is deployed, the attackers would then establish persistence to ensure they can regain access even if the system is restarted.
   - **MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**
     - **Initial Access (T1193):** Exploiting a vulnerability in Office applications.
     - **Execution (T1059):** Using PowerShell to execute the backdoor.
     - **Persistence (T1060):** Writing to the registry run key to ensure the backdoor runs at startup.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of attack steps and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is highly likely that the attackers will deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER before establishing persistence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
