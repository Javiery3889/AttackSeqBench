### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence involves the malware targeting files on hard drives and network drives for discovery.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware then searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts using techniques described under "Data from Removable Media."

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files.
     - According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the technique "Data from Removable Media" (T1115) involves adversaries collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices.
     - It is common for malware to search multiple storage locations, including removable drives, to maximize the amount of data it can exfiltrate.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files.
     - This would imply that the malware is limited to only searching hard drives and network drives, which is less comprehensive and less likely for a sophisticated malware like CosmicDuke.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that CosmicDuke is known for its comprehensive data collection capabilities, it is highly likely that it would search removable drives as well.
   - The technique "Data from Removable Media" is a common and logical next step in the data collection process after targeting hard drives and network drives.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
