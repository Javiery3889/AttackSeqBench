### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Operating in memory to evade defenses.
     - Using the DCOM object `C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880` to execute files without saving them to disk.
     - Executing a PowerShell script.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 (Command and Control) servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Operating in Memory:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection by traditional file-based security solutions.
   - **Using DCOM Object:**
     - The DCOM object `C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880` is known to be used by various malware families to execute files in memory without writing them to disk. This is a sophisticated technique often used in advanced attacks.
   - **Executing PowerShell Script:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, including communication with C2 servers and downloading additional payloads.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers and Downloading Payloads:**
     - Once a PowerShell script is executed, it is common for it to communicate with C2 servers to receive further instructions or download additional payloads. This is a typical behavior in multi-stage attacks.
   - **Ursnif Malware and GandCrab Ransomware:**
     - Ursnif is a banking trojan known for stealing sensitive information.
     - GandCrab is a ransomware family known for encrypting files and demanding a ransom.
     - Both are known to use sophisticated techniques to evade detection and communicate with C2 servers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described (operating in memory, using DCOM, and executing a PowerShell script) is consistent with the behavior of advanced malware.
   - Given the sophistication of the techniques used, it is highly likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers to download additional payloads.
   - The mention of Ursnif and GandCrab, which are known to use such techniques, further supports this likelihood.
