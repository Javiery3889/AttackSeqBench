### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Mustang Panda group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Delivering a downloader with filenames linked to current events.
     - Opening a decoy document to gain initial access.
     - Executing the Korplug malware through a DLL side-loading vulnerability.
     - Engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Mustang Panda is known for using social engineering and phishing techniques to deliver malware. The use of filenames linked to current events and opening a decoy document to gain initial access is a common TTP for this group.
   - **Execution of Korplug Malware:**
     - Korplug is a known malware used by Mustang Panda. The technique of executing malware through a DLL side-loading vulnerability is a plausible method for this group to use, as it allows them to run malicious code without directly executing a suspicious file.
   - **Control-Flow Obfuscation:**
     - Control-flow obfuscation is a technique used to evade detection by making the code harder to analyze. This is a common defense evasion technique used by advanced threat actors, including Mustang Panda.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of Mustang Panda. The group is known to use social engineering to gain initial access, execute malware through vulnerabilities, and employ obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
