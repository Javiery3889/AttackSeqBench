### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial discovery phase where the attacker uses scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and specific commands to scan a range of IP addresses for open ports (445, 3389, 1433, 3306, 80, 443).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attacker (Earth Lusca) will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of HUC Port Banner Scanner and the command `hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443` indicates that the attacker is scanning for open ports on a range of IP addresses. This is a common initial step in the discovery phase of an attack to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Exploitation of Remote Services:**
     - The ports being scanned (445, 3389, 1433, 3306, 80, 443) are commonly associated with various services:
       - **445 (SMB):** Often used for file sharing and can be exploited for remote code execution.
       - **3389 (RDP):** Remote Desktop Protocol, which can be used to gain remote access to a system.
       - **1433 (SQL Server):** Database service that can be exploited for SQL injection or other vulnerabilities.
       - **3306 (MySQL):** Another database service that can be exploited.
       - **80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS):** Web services that can be used for various attacks, including web shell uploads.
   - **Lateral Movement and Network Tunnels:**
     - Once the attacker has identified vulnerable services, it is common to exploit these services to gain initial access to the network.
     - After gaining access, the attacker may engage in lateral movement to spread to other systems within the network.
     - Establishing network tunnels (e.g., using tools like SSH tunnels or other methods) is a common technique to maintain persistent access and exfiltrate data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that Earth Lusca will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
