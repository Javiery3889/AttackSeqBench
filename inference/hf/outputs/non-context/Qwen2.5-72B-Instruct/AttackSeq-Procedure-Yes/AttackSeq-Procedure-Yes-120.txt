### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Agrius.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.
     - Deploying webshells.
   - The question then asks if Agrius is likely to leverage compromised accounts and use offensive security tools for lateral movement within the target network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Webshells:**
     - Registering a backdoor as a service and deploying webshells are common techniques used to maintain long-term access to a compromised system. This indicates that Agrius has already gained a foothold in the network and is preparing for further actions.
   - **Leveraging Compromised Accounts:**
     - Once a threat actor has established persistence, the next logical step is to move laterally within the network to gain access to more systems and data. Leveraging compromised accounts is a common method for lateral movement.
   - **Using Offensive Security Tools:**
     - Offensive security tools (such as Mimikatz, PowerShell Empire, etc.) are often used by threat actors to automate and facilitate lateral movement. These tools can help in extracting credentials, executing commands on remote systems, and maintaining stealth.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that Agrius has already achieved persistence and deployed webshells, it is highly likely that the next step would be to leverage compromised accounts and use offensive security tools for lateral movement. This is a standard progression in many cyber attacks, as it allows the threat actor to expand their control over the network and access more valuable resources.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
